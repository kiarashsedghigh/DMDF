But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft."}

The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years.

The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the"}

She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles.

{"idx": "12", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months.

Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society."}
{"idx": "14", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead.

{"idx": "19", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quig"}

It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Everybody won. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self.

Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue.

Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance"}

The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed"}

Our economy is currently haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate and it does not help that we are also experiencing this kind of political uncertainty and policy incoherence from government.\nCOSATU expects cabinet reshuffles to be about strengthening the capacity of government in order to help government to better implement its developmental agenda and deliver on its promises.

{"idx": "45", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W.

And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano \u201cStripping Paper\u201d was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive \u201cSuspect My Tears\u201d had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: \u201cNew Lace Sleeves\u201d from 1981\u2019s \u201cTrust\u201d; a rocking, new-wavey \u201c(I Don\u2019t Want to Go To) Chelsea,\u201d with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit \u2013 his 1977 U.S. breakthrough \u201cWatching the Detectives,\u201d (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction \u2013 and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986\u2019s \u201cIndoor Fireworks\u201d to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d from his last disc"}

Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed.

But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers.\"\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements."}

They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working"}

Those three Star Wars prequels were just god-awful.\nJL: I know what happened to George Lucas: the \u201880s. If movies peaked in the \u201870s, then it\u2019s fair to say that the 2000s is the Renaissance period for TV. The new Battlestar [Galactica] was at least a thousand times better than the old one.

In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December\u2014the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact\u2014IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings.

It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.\nThe city \"has whittled away at the commercial parking infrastructure,\" said Thorpe, the chief executive of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, which he founded in 2004 to deal with parking issues for small and midsize businesses.\nAt the same time, trucks are making more deliveries than ever, and they must do that regardless of whether there's unloading space available. \"Trucking is not a 'choice' situation,\" Thorpe said. \"It's a necessity.\"\nBut now the 600 members of his group, as well as large fleet operators such as UPS and FedEx, are facing higher fines\u2014and possibly more paperwork and time in traffic court\u2014as a little-known yet controversial city policy comes under fire. The stipulated-fine program was established in 2004 by the Department of Finance to let businesses pay slightly reduced fines\u2014and no fines at all for some infractions\u2014in exchange for not contesting their tickets.\nIt was mainly a way to reduce everyone's administrative costs while having delivery companies pay roughly what they would have otherwise. (The reductions were calculated with an eye on the percentage of tickets that were successfully challenged.) But the program was a sore point with advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives, which considered it a corporate giveaway that neutered traffic enforcement.\nLast month, in a bid at leveling the playing field for businesses not in the program\u2014and furthering the city's congestion-reduction goals\u2014the Finance Department announced that next month it would raise the program's fines, including those now set at zero.\nAs if that were not bad enough for Thorpe's membership, in the same week five City Council members introduced a bill to abolish the program. They denounced it as a free pass to large corporations and a contributor to reckless parking and congestion.\nThorpe says it's the council bill that's a giveaway\u2014to parking-ticket brokers, who stand to gain business adjudicating tickets. He sees no way that the Finance Department's plan will change driver behavior or have any impact on congestion.\n\"The theory of the program was there are bad things, good things and some things in between, and it taught the driver you're going to pay a lot to do bad things and little or none to do the others,\" Thorpe said. \"Now they've put the bad and good closer together, removing the driver's incentive for doing the good, because it's going to cost just a little more to do the bad.\"\nIn fact, good and bad parking behavior will not be punished that similarly. The most serious violations that get discounts, such as obstructing traffic ($10 off the $115 total), will now get no break at all, while many of the zero-fine infractions will cost $25.\nBut Thorpe says those increases could cost some of his members hundreds of dollars a week\u2014enough that he would consider taking them out of the program.

Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody\u2019s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft\u2019s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company\u2019s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company\u2019s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn\u2019t released until 2010.

When a special session seemed imminent on gambling issues, again, they made the same call, without success.\nNow, Democrats have organized a last-ditch effort to use an obscure state law to poll lawmakers on their willingness to come back for a special session to address education funding.\nState Reps. Shevrin Jones of West Park and Nicholas Duran of Miami said Thursday that they and 33 others have filed petitions with the Florida Secretary of State for the poll. This method of calling a special session circumvents the Republican Legislative leadership, who typically are the ones who must call any special sessions and declare its purpose.\nBoth Jones and Duran hail from the two counties, Broward and Miami-Dade, hit hardest by a change in the way the state calculates school funding this year, designed to direct more dollars to smaller districts. They, like the rest of the House members who aren't termed out, are up for re-election.\n\"In the aftermath of Parkland and the waning days of session, the Legislature took action for the safety of our schools,\" Duran said. \"In our rush to do something we didn't account for the conesequences of that bill 7026 and now the school districts are facing those consequences.\"\nSince the passage of this year's budget as well as SB 7026, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, school districts have been scrambling to comply with the new safety requirements as well as their normal operations. Several are considering raising local property taxes.\nDemocrats tried the same tactic after the Pulse shooting in the summer of 2016, in an effort to force a special session vote on guns. They failed to garner enough support to call the session.\nThis year's final vote on the budget was taken on March 11, the Sunday after the legislative session was supposed to end but it went into overtime after the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting changed the entire direction of the session and caused lawmakers to reconcile with issues like school safety and gun rights not previously taking center stage.\nJones was not present for the vote on the budget. He said it was because after the Legislature's official end date he needed to go back to his full-time job as the executive director of the Florida Reading Corps, a branch of AmeriCorps.

She sat down recently to talk about language barriers, cabin fever and readjusting to life in east Sacramento.\nQ: Between orphanage work in Zimbabwe and Guatemala and clinic work in Bolivia, you\u2019re no stranger to long flights. How did that come about?\nA: I\u2019ve always enjoyed traveling, and then once I became a nurse, to be able to use that career overseas was really neat to me. What intrigued me about Mercy Ships is it\u2019s a fully run hospital \u2013 you have a lot of equipment, you have a lot of medications.

So much that you see is diseases of poverty.\nQ: In August, you were scheduled to join a Mercy Ships crew in Benin in West Africa, but the service was canceled due to a possible Ebola case. Months later, your own hospital became a designated Ebola treatment center, and you took part in the preparedness efforts. Would you have considered going overseas to provide care during the outbreak if given the chance?\nA: Had I been signed up with an Ebola team, I wouldn\u2019t have been opposed. I enjoy the risk. I think that\u2019s part of why I became a nurse, because there\u2019s always those risks out there. When that came up, I decided to not be scared and to take more education and learn more about Ebola. For me, it was just a decision of, I\u2019m a nurse, and I have risks even at UC Davis in Sacramento, and that\u2019s why we learn to protect ourselves.\nQ: You said you had a much heavier patient load and more limited resources on the ship than you do in Sacramento. What did you learn on this trip that you\u2019ll bring back to UCD?\nA: In the ward, there were 15 patients at a time with five nurses and five translators. There were people on the guitar and singing, and kids running around. It was a very different environment for me. I had to calculate my antibiotics and draw them up and mix them. It was just a stretch for me as a nurse, to need to focus on something, but also learn an art of nursing where I am appreciating and valuing the relationships of the Malagasy people. ... Just challenging my mind to see that I can function differently, and to bring that back to the burn unit is huge.\nQ: Working in the oral and facial ward, you said you saw a lot of patients with physical obstructions that had long been neglected, such as large dental tumors or cleft palates. What is life like for them after surgery?\nA: When you have a pimple and it feels like the end of the world, imagine missing a nose or having a tumor that\u2019s out to there (gestures to a point several inches from her face). A lot of our patients lose their families, or their spouses will leave them. They are outcasts from society, so this gives them confidence. It brings them a huge healing, not just the physical aspect but their soul as well. ...

Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler"}

That is, those are the amount you'd be paid if you chose an annuity, doled out over 29 years.

But those numbers aren't splayed across billboards and shown in countless mini marts across America.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 1 in 302.5 million \u2014 mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken.

Could it reach $2 billion?\nThe odds of winning Powerball are 1 in 292.2 million.\nThe odds of winning don't change as jackpots get larger, but the chance that more than one winner will share the prize do.

Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the 'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that. Last year, the East Arkansas Planning and Development District and the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability launched Delta Roots: The Mid-South Regional Food System Plan.\nThe plan lays out a 20-year path to a local, sustainable food network here in which consumers will eat more locally grown products and farmers can cash in on the $550 million annual demand for produce in the Memphis area."}

In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors\u2019 orders.\nDoctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don\u2019t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don\u2019t get better, and that our health care costs are so high.\nIt is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn\u2019t doing what he is supposed to.\nBad adherence doesn\u2019t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can\u2019t manage to stick to an exercise program.

The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of"}

If the US has extreme weather we usually experience similar a few days later. If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness.\nThe UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods.\nBlack Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though?\nAs usual the answer is probably not.\nIt is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot.\nThis year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well.\nBargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist.\nConsider all the implications of your purchase before you buy.\n1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle.\n2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight.\nHaving some idea of what you want to buy helps. If you shop \"blind\" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford.\nCyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond.\nOne factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways. Brits take care and look after your money this cyber Monday.\nPerhaps the rest of you would be wise to follow suit too!"}

The packed stadium was rocking and the Penn State sideline drew sudden inspiration from Mauti\u2019s jackhammer hit.\nThe Nittany Lions then rattled off 39 unanswered points to secure a 46-17 win.\nIt took a hit of that caliber to spark a young Mauti\u2019s love of the game.\nAlthough Rich Mauti played seven seasons in the NFL, he wouldn\u2019t let his sons step on a football field until they were in seventh grade. In Michael\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t start playing until eighth grade.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the youngest Mauti to be put off by football.\nSo Mauti, the smallest kid on the team, let the season play out. Soon, an unwilling participant became the fiercest of competitors on the freshman team at Mandeville (La.) High School.\nHe started the season as a quarterback but soon found himself making plays on kickoff coverage.\nIt\u2019s not that Mauti intends to injure opponents. He plays within the rules. But he won\u2019t deny that football is a violent game and being the player to initiate contact is Mauti\u2019s specialty.\nIf an opponent remembers Mauti\u2019s number after a hit and has second thoughts about touching the football for the rest of the game, Mauti\u2019s made a huge impact by his own standards.\n\u201cThe feeling of the hit.

The best part? Call minutes made via WiFi aren't deducted from your plan. That's right -- as long as you're within range of a wireless broadband network, you'll have unlimited calls. An added benefit to this is that you're almost guaranteed great signal strength when you're in a place with good WiFi coverage.

When you sign up with the service, you'll get one of the aforementioned wireless routers for free after rebate, but any 802.11b-compatible router should work.

This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece.

And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now.

Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nHarry Hogge: What do you know about stock car racing?\nCole Trickle: Well... watched it on television, of course.\nHarry Hogge: You've seen it on television?\nCole Trickle: ESPN. The coverage is excellent, you'd be surprised at how much you can pick up.\nHarry Hogge: I'm sure I would.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set\u2014except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it."}

On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification.

Galvin knows it\u2019s no easy task but says the result will be vastly different from their 6-0 loss to Henwood Park in July. \u201cWe were missing a few players from our back line that game, so I think that probably affected us a fair bit,\u201d Galvin said. \u201cStill, we know they\u2019ll be hard to get on top of and they\u2019ll throw everything at us in attack. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to hold them out and look to hit them through counterattack.\u201d While you\u2019re with us, did you know that The Daily Advertiser is now offering sports and local events as part of its growing email newsletter service?

It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals \u2013 like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There\u2019s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious \u2013 albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It\u2019s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable \u201cawakening\u201d material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt\u2019s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart \u2013 which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story.

Now a Tucson resident, she continues to advocate for reproductive rights and sexual health.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona serves more than 100,000 families every year; maybe your family is one of them.\nTucson is home to the Margaret Sanger Health Center, namesake of Planned Parenthood's founder. A century ago, Margaret Sanger was a New York City nurse who witnessed the horrors of women dying prematurely after having too many children, while others died from botched abortions. This experience motivated her to become an activist for the availability and legality of contraception. Sanger was a controversial figure\u2014and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early '40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep.

Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\" until you achieve your goal for the day. If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be."}

In this Plan there was little or no distinction made between Communist states that were at war with the United States and those that were not. Some sites (Designated Ground Zeroes \u2013 DGZs) would be struck by two or more weapons, and included both military installations and urban-industrial areas. The alert force would target 199 cities and the full force would target 295.2 The planners estimated that the total human deaths from such an attack would be 108 million in the Soviet Union and 104 million in the PRC as well as several million in satellite states,3 while Kaplan estimated that 175 million Russians and Chinese would be killed by the \u2018alert\u2019 force and 285 million would be killed by a \u2018full\u2019 force, and an additional 40 million more injured.4 To make such threats credible, the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Energy (DoE) and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) conducted visible tests of new nuclear weapons in various atmospheric conditions in a twenty test series between 1946 and 1963. Even after the limited test ban treaty was adopted, they continued with underground tests.\nGeneral Thomas Power presided over the creation of SIOP-62 as Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command (1957\u20131964) and Director, Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (1960\u20131964).\nAs nuclear intimidation continued, and as other nations sought to gain \u2018parity\u2019, the global nuclear industry grew. It was clearly understood in these early decades that the dual-use of nuclear materials in nuclear energy generation and nuclear weapons served to establish and maintain national influence in the international arena. Since 1945, the supply and procurement of uranium together with coal (for steel production) has been a good indicator of a nation\u2019s capacity to both rapidly increase its energy production with the potential to produce munitions and, for those states already with the capacity, to produce and enhance a nuclear weapons arsenal. High-energy power generation was an index of a nation\u2019s war-making potential underlining the link between mining and militarisation.\nIn the following I seek to explain why and how the Australian government in 2014 has concluded a uranium trade deal with India that is in breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by tracing the development of a nuclear nexus between India, Australia, Japan and the United States. Just as it was in the early cold war, this trade in nuclear materials is informed by interlocking and mutually reinforcing economic and geostrategic interests that have long undermined international disarmament initiatives. I argue that changing climatic conditions caused by emissions intensive energy production, however, demand a fundamental re-thinking of this paradigm.\nOf the 67 reactors under construction globally as of July 20"}

From your phone, computer, tablet, credit cards, travel records and more. We know they are doing this because of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nJohn Oliver traveled to Moscow where Snowden, wanted by the U.S government, has asylum for the next three years. There he interviewed Snowden in an attempt to find out why more Americans don\u2019t care about the government spying on their personal lives.\nBased on Snowden\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s spying activities, here are five basic questions every American should ask themselves about the NSA surveillance program.\n1. Do you want the government to collect your data (including your naked pictures)?\nAccording to Oliver, Pew Research found that 46 percent of Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance. Why? It\u2019s too complicated and technical to try to trace the life cycle of a text message. Hilariously Oliver tries to put the issue into terms Americans will care about \u2014 whether or not the government has access to your naked pictures. Once everyday folks heard the argument in those terms, they got interested in the debate pretty fast.\n\u201cI did this [released secret NSA spying information] to give the American people the chance to decide for themselves what kind of government they want to have,\u201d Snowden tells Oliver.\nDo you want a government that hoards your most scandalous communications?\n2. Why did the government lie about its spying activity?\nOn June 1, 2015, key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire, including the controversial Section 215 provision, which has been interpreted by a FISA Court to mean that the government has the authority to collect comprehensive data on its citizens.\nPrior to the Snowden revelations about programs like PRISM, American government officials \u2014 including President Obama \u2014 said the government was collecting only basic phone and internet records, like when a call was made and to whom (metadata), rather than the actual content of the conversation. Snowden proved that\u2019s just not true.\nThe Snowden documents showed that the government was collecting and storing the content of Americans\u2019 communications too, like emails, phone calls, internet searches and text and chat messages, rather than just basic call record information.\nWorse yet, it\u2019s not just being looked at; it\u2019s being stored in monster government data centers in Utah, in case it needs to be looked at in the future. So if you want to play a semantics game, they aren\u2019t actively looking at it, just saving a copy in case they need to later. Does that make you feel any better about it?\n3. Can you trust the government with this kind of power?\nMobile phone data provides an incredibly detailed account of your life \u2014 your location, who you call, emails, text messages, internet searches, online shopping habits. Combine that level of detailed data contained in your credit card records, home and work emails and internet searches, and that\u2019s a pretty freaky accurate representation of who you are, where you\u2019ve been, with whom and what you were doing.

In its first six months of operation, the bright blue bikes logged more than 5 million trips. The system has nearly 100,000 annual members. Yet Citi Bike\u2013which unlike most bike shares in major cities, isn\u2019t subsidized by public funds\u2013is losing money. One of the main reasons is that while annual memberships are popular, the much more profitable day passes aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a phenomenon easily seen in this visualization of two days of Citi Bike rides around New York City.\nDesigner Jeff Ferzoco, Sarah Kaufman at New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation and Juan Francisco Saldarriaga of Columbia University\u2019s Spatial Information Design Lab worked together to visualize Citi Bike journey data from September 17 and 18 of last year. Over those two days, when the weather was in the 60s and there was no rain, Citi Bike saw 75,000 rides. Rides are separated by type of membership, either annual (blue) or casual (yellow).\nThe visualization doesn\u2019t show exact routes along the city\u2019s grid, but instead approximates trips by tracing straight lines between the endpoints. Ridership picks up early in the morning, around 5:30 a.m., and is heavy between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Almost all of those riders are annual members. Yellow dots are barely visible on the map, except a few around the very lower tip of Manhattan and up near Central Park.

The number of active riders hits 800 at 8:30 a.m., but spikes to more than 1,000 at 6 p.m.\nThough the balance of ridership clearly tips in favor of annual membership, it would be interesting to compare this data to a weekend.

Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case.

And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it\u2019s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it\u2019s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested\u2014perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department\u2019s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department \u201cwelcomes\u201d the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn\u2019t fall under the board\u2019s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board\u2019s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we\u2019d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them.

The sneak peek shared via Twitter details that Laura will be by her daughter\u2019s bedside, begging her to wake up. In addition, Lulu\u2019s father-in-law, Sonny, will pay a visit to her as well.\nWhile it sounds as if Lulu will face a lengthy, difficult recovery, General Hospital spoilers suggest that she might peek her eyes open during Friday\u2019s show.

The authors called for patients, communities and doctors to develop contingency plans for natural disasters.\nMore than eight months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s slow recovery has been marked by a persistent lack of water, a faltering power grid and a lack of essential services \u2013 all of which have imperiled the lives of many residents who have been struggling to get back on their feet, especially the infirm and those in remote areas, some of which were the hardest hit in September.\nMiliana Montanez cradled her mother\u2019s head as she lay dying on the floor of her bedroom here in Caguas, gasping for air and pleading for help.\nLeon\u2019s eyes bulged in terror as she described to her daughter the tiny points of light that appeared before her eyes moments before it was all over. She took one last exasperated gulp of air. That\u2019s when paramedics arrived. Far too late.\nLeon\u2019s death reverberated through her family and her community. Her son, a college student in a town two hours away, sees no point in coming home anymore. Her husband is withdrawn and is close to losing his job. Her daughter struggles to understand what happened as she fights off despair and anger recalling all the chaos that revolved around Leon\u2019s last moments on the floor of her home.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s government faced immediate scrutiny after initially reporting that 16 people had died as a result of the storm, which strafed much of the island on Sept. 20. That number more than doubled after President Donald Trump visited in October, when he specifically noted the low death toll. The number kept rising until early December, when authorities said 64 had died.\nThe official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital \u2013 only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.\nThe new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.\nGov. Ricardo Rossells\u2019s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.\nAfter pressure from Congress and statistical analyses from news organizations that put the death toll at higher than 1,000, Rossells"}

How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W.

Sun Tzu, for example. The ancient strategist wrote, \"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\"\nTransfixed by the light of their own brilliance reflecting from pastel-sheened walls and bulletproof windows, the Bush administration hears him not.\nKarl von Clausewitz wrote, \"No one starts a war \u2014 or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so \u2014 without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.\"\nHear, hear! But it seems that the neoconservatives who long envisioned the toppling of the Ba\u2019ath Party, and the emplacement of an administration-friendly Prime Minister in Baghdad as a Do-it-Yourself weekend project, were deafened once again by their own self-congratulatory cheers.\nClausewitz, always trying to help innocent politicians, wryly noted, \"In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.\"\nSir Basil Liddell-Hart, in the mid-1900s, not so long ago, expanded upon Clausewitz in this regard. The old Brit noted, \"Natural hazards, however formidable, are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards. All conditions are more calculable, all obstacles more surmountable than those of human resistance.\"\nAs President, George W.

{"idx": "172", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Stopping nearsightedness in kids and more.\nThis week, Dr. Sydney Spiesel discusses a way to stop the progression of nearsightedness in kids, a better method of hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause, and new developments in the search for a cause for autism. His column will start appearing a couple of times a month.\nCondition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences. It has long been understood that the condition has a strong genetic component: Nearsighted parents are more likely to have nearsighted children. But recent research has shown that other factors contribute. For example, just as our mothers warned us, there is now evidence that doing close-up work, like reading, seems to promote the condition.\nHow it progresses: The eyeball of a nearsighted person is deeper than the eyeball of a person with normal vision and becomes deeper as nearsightedness progresses. Myopia often begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 8. As children grow, their nearsightedness worsens, continuing to do so long after they have stopped growing taller. Though we know a lot about factors associated with nearsightedness and its progression, we have no good ideas yet about the mechanism. But can we stop it?\nNew research: A recent study by Wei-Han Chua and colleagues at the Singapore National Eye Center elegantly built on older research and successfully used atropine eye drops to treat myopia in children. Atropine is a longer-lasting version of the pupil-dilating drops your doctor uses when you go for an eye exam. Available by prescription in the United States, the drops are mainly used to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) instead of the older treatment, patching, which children often hate.\nDr. Chua and his co-workers studied the progression of nearsightedness in 400 children between 6 and 12 years of age. Half the children were treated with atropine eye drops, and the other half were treated with placebo eye drops. Both kinds of drops were administered nightly to one eye, so the untreated eye could be compared with the treated one. The children were followed for two years. All used eyeglasses to correct their nearsightedness, and because atropine dilates the pupil, the lenses of the glasses self-darkened in bright light, to avoid discomfort for the children whose pupils were dilated.\nFindings: The effects were extraordinary: After two years, on average, the children\u2019s nearsightedness had not progressed in the atropine-treated eyes but had dramatically worsened in the placebo-treated and untreated eyes. Similarly, atropine-treated eyes did not become deeper, while placebo-treated and untreated eyes did. No serious adverse effects were observed in the course of the research.\nConclusion: This is extremely promising. Further work needs to be done to determine the ideal concentration of atropine in the eye drops, to find out how long the treatment needs to last, and if the effects are permanent. Because atropine interferes with close focusing, children will probably need to wear bifocals while they\u2019re using the atropine drops. Much more research must be done to help us understand why nearsightedness develops and progresses. But"}

{"idx": "177", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: After your business is up and running, your focus naturally shifts to increasing efficiency. The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you should tweak the environment in which they work to insure the best possible results.\nThere are many reasons why developing a protocol to measure efficiency benefits your business. You are able to pinpoint areas that need improvement, and you can break your team\u2019s performance down by tasks. Perhaps you will notice that the whole process is going smoothly except for one minor operation that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. This kind of insight can help you restructure the physical environment or delegate tasks in a new way to increase efficiency. You can also evaluate the performance of individual employees. Take a look at how much you get out of employees versus how much you pay them.\nEmployees might be a bit nervous about your new methods of close observation and evaluation. This is acceptable and sometimes even beneficial, as employees will make an increased effort if they know their performance is being tracked. However, you don't have to be an intimidating taskmaster. This is a good opportunity to mix in positive reinforcement and show your appreciation for your team. You can offer incentives, such as public recognition, time off or a share in productivity gains. Whatever mode you choose, employees are sure to improve efficiency if they feel that good work is rewarded and they develop a sense of the needs of the business as a whole.\nEmployees need to have the appropriate equipment and technology to carry out their functions efficiently. A lazy and incompetent worker on a tractor will most likely outperform even the hardest-working person who is plowing manually. Regular maintenance and upgrades of your equipment might seem costly and burdensome, but they are critical to the success of your business. Making sure that your employees have the tools they need to get the job done will drastically improve your output per dollar spent or per unit of time. Keeping equipment up to par also prevents on the job injuries, possible lawsuits and time lost to malfunctions.\nSkill is another side of employee efficiency. Your team must have the requisite skill sets to produce up to par, making on-the-job training and education generally worthwhile. Even though specialization and division of labor are important, your team's efficiency can benefit greatly through cross-training, which gives workers a broader perspective and an understanding of the context in which their work fits. It allows them to help each other and to prioritize more effectively, resulting in overall efficiency. This increased workforce agility allows workers to shift their capacity to where it is needed and reduces problems due to worker absences."}
{"idx": "178", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as"}

{"idx": "187", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers.\nThis is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed\u2019s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed\u2019s death in 632AD, the only \u201ctraces we possess\u201d for the development of Islam \u201care either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages\u201d.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed\u2019s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the \u201cHoly Land\u201d, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, \u201ca version of Islam\u2019s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God\u201d, and in turn no room \u201cfor acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others\u201d, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland\u2019s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\nFocusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style. But, as I am sure Holland would accept, in part because of the charged nature of the material and issues on which it dwells, and in part because of the vast developments and arenas it attempts to encompass, it is also bound to encounter the full spectrum of critical reaction"}

{"idx": "191", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group , though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the company further reduces guidance. Although the fiscal quarter doesn&apos;t include the"}

With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\"\nAsked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: \"The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,\u201d rather than \u201conly a channel operator.\u201d He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels.\nAMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan.\nAsked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. \"We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters,\" said Sapan. \"And you don\u2019t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels.\" He added that his team felt that \"a day of reckoning would come\u201d for some peers.\nWhile the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, \"we have already skinnied our offering down.\u201d And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. \u201cCollectively, they are underpriced,\" said Sapan.\nThe cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility.\nAdjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was \"primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense.\" Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share.

{"idx": "200", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here\u2019s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don\u2019t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies\u2019 failures, Chopra said.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA\u2019s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive\u2019s deadlines fast approaching, it\u2019s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency. After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009. It ended up being released Dec. 8, which shows that creating a transparent government isn\u2019t a see-through process."}

How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives.

Paslawsky fought under the pseudonym \u2018Franko\u2019 and served in the US army until at least 1991, when he was described as a captain in a New York Times op-ed.\nThere was a very good reason for Paslawsky\u2019s use of a nom-de-guerre like \u2018Franko\u2019 and the social media handle \u2018Bruce Springnote\u2019 and for the soft soap in the US media.\nPaslawsky was not an \u201cordinary Joe\u201d from New Jersey with benign family connections to Ukraine who suddenly decided to help defend the motherland, he was the nephew of the notorious Nazi Mykola Lebed \u2013 who incredibly was employed by the CIA from 1949 to possibly as late as 1991. There is no insinuation that Paslawksy also harbored fascist or anti-Semitic beliefs, but family influences surely played a significant role in the formation of his world view.\nLebed began his terrorist career in 1934 when he was sentenced to death for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki \u2013 later commuted to life imprisonment \u2013 but he escaped in 1939. He would go on to lead the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Poles in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (the area around Lutsk and Rivne in modern-day Ukraine).\nInstead of facing trial for his vicious war crimes after his fellow fascists in Germany were defeated, Lebed was spirited to America where \u2013 based in New York \u2013 he gathered information on the Soviet Union for the CIA (a scheme known as Operation Aerodynamic).\nOf course, sheltering Nazis was a common US practice after the war, as bizarre as it seems today, with the primary reason being their potential usefulness in the fight against the Soviet Union. The best known example is Klaus Barbie who they helped to escape to Bolivia, and later Argentina, but according to a 2009 National Archives report \u201cHitler\u2019s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, US Intelligence and the Cold War\u201d there were dozens of similar cases. Among them was Rudolf Mildner, who was \u201cresponsible for the execution of hundreds, if not thousands, of suspected Polish resisters\u201d and was also involved in the deportation of 8,000 Danish Jews to Auschwitz. The Americans helped Mildner to settle in Argentina. Another was Hans Scholl, a member of Einsatzgruppe B in Belarus, which was blamed for the execution of more than 45,000 people, most of them Jewish.\nThe report goes into great detail about the hideous crimes of Paslawsky\u2019s uncle.

{"idx": "217", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Technological change has always posed a challenge for companies. But, as we saw once again in 2015, it has never occurred as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as today. As innovation sweeps across virtually every sector, from heavy industry to services, it is transforming the competitive landscape, with the most advanced companies\u2014rather than the largest or most established players\u2014coming out on top.\nFor incumbents, the threat of displacement is very real. The average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 has fallen from 90 years in 1935 to less than 18 years today. Disruptive new players like Uber, which has upended the taxi industry, are tough competitors, often staking out market share by shifting more surplus to consumers. This is part of a broader trend of intensifying competition that, according to recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute, could reduce the global after-tax profit pool from almost 10% of global GDP today to its 1980 level of about 7.9% within a decade.\nThe effect of technology on competition arises largely from the power of digital platforms and network effects. New digital platforms reduce marginal costs (the cost of producing additional units of a good or service) to nearly zero. Adding, say, a Google Maps user carries negligible costs, because the service relies on GPS location data that is already stored on a user\u2019s phone. This allows Google to scale incredibly quickly, and then to leverage this scale (and the convenience of having a single platform) to move into adjacent sectors\u2014such as music (Google Play), payment (Google Wallet), and word processing (Google Docs). In this manner, tech firms can quickly come to challenge incumbents in seemingly unrelated industries.\nOf course, tech firms are not the only ones innovating. A handful of leading firms in practically every industry are deploying digital technology in increasingly sophisticated ways\u2014and seeing huge benefits. The use of sensors to monitor livestock, for example, has far-reaching implications for the food industry.\nBut the most digitally advanced sectors show the greatest progress. Indeed, over the past 20 years, profit margins in these tech-infused sectors have grown two-three times faster, on average, than in the rest of the economy. Even within the most advanced sectors, there is a yawning gap between the top-performing companies and the rest of the pack. For example, the retail offerings of digitally advanced multinational banks far outstrip those of local credit unions.\nAs technology transforms business models and processes, it is also changing the way employees work. Recent McKinsey research finds that already-proven technologies could automate as much as 45% of the tasks individuals are currently paid to perform. In the US alone, that is the equivalent of about $2 trillion in annual wages.\nThe potential benefits of this transformation for companies extend far beyond cost savings, as workers gain time to pursue more valuable tasks involving critical thinking and creativity. Financial advisers can spend less time analysing financials and more time developing solutions that meet clients\u2019 needs. Or interior decorators can shift their attention from taking measurements to devising design concepts, meeting with clients, or sourcing materials.\nTechnology also allows companies to rethink conventional wisdom on organizational design and governance. New information-sharing technologies deliver greater transparency, making organizations more efficient and, in many cases, less hierarchical.\nFor example, the CEOs of Apple, Inditex (a multinational clothing company) and Zappos (a large online retailer) have adopted broad spans of control (the number of subordinates directly"}

But Jacobsen, a consultant who advises businesses \u2013 primarily convenience stores \u2013 on where best to locate, said it will overall hurt the businesses in Washoe City.

The FBI's victims' suit against the officers who wronged them can proceed to the next step.\nHaving decided the lawsuit can continue, the Appeals Court decides it doesn't need to reach a finding on the agents' qualified immunity assertions.

But he told reporters at Vienna airport that he expected IAEA experts to be allowed to go to Parchin and follow up on suspicions it might have been used as part of secret arms-related experiments once the probe is resumed.\nIn Tehran, Iran&apos;s state TV made no mention of progress, reporting only that there was no agreement on visiting Parchin. But Iranian envoy Ali Asghar Soltanieh also said a new meeting was set for Jan. 16.\nWhile Nackaerts&apos; comments gave cause for some optimism, they were not the first instance of a senior IAEA official saying that the standoff was close to resolution.\nReturning from Tehran talks more than five months ago, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said the two sides had agreed on \"an almost clean text\", saying a breakthrough deal would be signed soon. Follow-up IAEA-Iran meetings did not yield significant results.\nIran says it does not want atomic arms and has justified a nearly yearlong delay in cooperating with the IAEA&apos;s probe by saying that a framework regulating such an investigation must be agreed on first. But as talks on such an agreement have dragged on, agency officials have complained that they may be nothing more than a delaying tactic.\nThey are particularly concerned that such delays can hurt their efforts to investigate Parchin. The IAEA suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of conventional explosives there that could be used to detonate a nuclear charge and cited satellite photos indicating a cleanup of the site, at a sprawling military base southeast of Tehran.\nIran denies it is sanitizing the site, but Amano has warned that his agency&apos;s chances of a meaningful investigation there are diminishing.\nNackaerts offered no details on the substance of his talks. But diplomats familiar with the negotiations have said previously that the agreement was stalled because the IAEA wanted repeated access to sites, officials or documents of interest. Instead, Tehran demanded that once such access was granted, the person, document or site be off limits to the IAEA for repeated visits, questioning of viewing.\nAmano&apos;s announcement of a nearly done deal in May came just days before the two sides met in Baghdad for a new round of negotiations meant to defuse tensions over Iran&apos;s nuclear program before leaving the negotiating table with little progress made.\nThis time, Nackaerts spoke of movement on the probe as Iran and six world powers again prepare to meet.

Such entities, including Mr. Johnson\u2019s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation\u2019s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations.\n-- IT\u2019S WORTH NOTING: This is hardly the first time Johnson has clashed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP leadership team. He also fought with them over how the Obamacare repeal process played out. He is just the first Senate Republican out of the gate opposing the bill. Just because the House GOP tax overhaul was on the fast track and didn\u2019t face many hiccups, don\u2019t expect the same to be true in the Senate.\nFOR EXAMPLE\u2026 JAKE TAPPER talks with SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-MAINE) on CNN\u2019S \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION: TAPPER: \u201cYou said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \u2018no\u2019 vote from you?\u201d COLLINS: \u201cWell, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bill said we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that\u2019s \u2026 disproportionately 80 percent on those who make under $50,000.\nMORE TAX DRAMA IN THE STATES -- \u201cIn Democrat-led state capitals, GOP tax reform push could scramble fiscal plans,\u201d by Laura Nahmias in New York, Katherine Landergan in New Jersey and Carla Marinucci in California: \u201cThe Republican tax reform push in Washington is setting off budgetary alarm bells in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, in the latest political skirmish to pit national Republicans against Democratic state and big city leaders.\n\u201cWith Republicans intent on shrinking or repealing the state and local tax deduction, California officials are worried that the House-passed tax bill, and the emerging Senate measure, will force local governments to reduce taxes and make big cuts to schools and social services. In New York, where New York City and state revenues are heavily reliant on just a handful of wealthy tax filers, budget watchdogs fear federal tax changes could trigger the flight of those residents. And in New Jersey, plans for a new millionaire\u2019s tax, one of incoming Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s biggest campaign promises, are already being reined in as the Democratic-led New Jersey"}

In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n\u201cFor us this is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial. More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December"}

The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland"}

Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse.

{"idx": "231", "prompt": "Continue the following text: WASHINGTON -- With television lights glaring, 20 lawmakers will gather next week to revisit the fight that consumed Congress before Christmas over renewing a Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.\nLittle real work will be done, but the meeting will mark the formal start of an effort to untangle a dispute that both parties want to resolve, though for different reasons. Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?"}

The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis. I am in favour of that.\"\nSo why should this bailout work when a previous one has failed, and in accepting the stringent conditions attached, has Greece surrendered control of its own economy?\nTo what extent will this second bailout rescue Greece's shattered economy, at what cost and how is this going to impact Greece's internal politics?\nJoining presenter Mike Hanna on Inside Story are guests"}

In the last 3 minutes, they knocked down five three-pointers.\nSophomore guards Anna Blum and Natalie Priest each made two 3s down the stretch. Freshman forward Payton List added one.\nWith 3 seconds left, Priest\u2019s bomb from long distance tied the game, 61-61.\nBut just when it seemed like the game was headed to overtime, Avonworth guard Harris Robinson was fouled just past the midcourt line with less than a second on the clock \u2026 0.2 seconds to be exact.\nShe calmly sank both free throws for a win that put Avonworth (6-3, 4-0) in sole possession of first place.\nHayden Robinson, a 5-foot-10 senior forward who\u2019s going to Quinnipiac University on a track scholarship, led Avonworth with a game-high 22 points.

After being \u201cupstaged\u201d by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn\u2019t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack\u2019s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It\u2019s perfect for this series. I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He\u2019s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we\u2019ve seen in this series isn\u2019t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he\u2019s not afraid to show it. That\u2019s not the character we\u2019ve seen in this series. For the most part he\u2019s been very straight faced. I understand he\u2019s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren\u2019t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita\u2019s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the \u201cGreen Candle\u201d episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, \u201cI need to do more \u2026 I don\u2019t care about leading. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita\u2019s plan for Zack doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he\u2019s selfless. It\u2019s more about the good that\u2019s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita\u2019s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn\u2019t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya\u2019s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister.

The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City\u2019s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City\u2019s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City\u2019s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe "}

Speeches and footage from several al Qaeda leaders from around the world were shown interlaced with combat footage from the African jihadist group.\nAt the very beginning of the video, JNIM showed its media division, Az Zallaqa, as being in the same family as other al Qaeda media wings. This includes As Sahab (al Qaeda central\u2019s media division), Al Malahem (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), Al Kata\u2019ib (Shabaab), and al Andalus (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). By putting its media wing alongside other media branches of the global jihadist organization, JNIM is portraying Az Zallaqa as another official al Qaeda media organization.\nThis is important as some have categorized JNIM as merely being \u201clinked\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d with al Qaeda. However, JNIM clearly sees itself on equal footing with al Qaeda\u2019s official branches around the world.\nAs the video progresses, JNIM depicts its conflict in Mali as being the same conflict seen in various places around the world, such as Nigeria, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Various killed al Qaeda leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, Nasir al Wuyashi, Anwar al Awlaki, Ibn Khattab, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, Abu al Hasan al Rashid al Bulaydi, Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Abu Firas al Suri, and Muhammad al Zahawi, are shown in a eulogy segment.\nA speech from Sulayman Abu al Ghaith, a former al Qaeda spokesman who is now serving a life sentence in the US, can be heard over footage of combat from JNIM. \u201cGod ordered us to protect the vulnerable, so we protect the vulnerable. God ordered us to terrorize the apostates, so we terrorize the apostates. God ordered us to kill the leaders of disbelief, so we kill the leaders of disbelief,\u201d al Ghaith said as he linked al Qaeda\u2019s jihad to \u201cprotecting the vulnerable\u201d around the world.\nThe message then shifted to lambasting both Mali and France for their efforts to combat the jihadist group in the West African country. JNIM used English-speaking political commentators to suggest France\u2019s involvement in Mali is a large conspiracy as part of a wider war against Islam. A JNIM official identified as Abdul Hakim al Muhajir [implying he is a foreign fighter] reiterated in this point in a long-winded tirade against France.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s war on Muslims in the region is not a economic war \u2026 it is between faith and apostasy, and Islam and idolatry,\u201d al Muhajir stated in his speech.

Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55\u201370 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood"}

This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations"}

{"idx": "264", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: President Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office last Thursday, after the two met to discuss the presidential transition.\nDonald Trump's victory in the race for the White House leaves widespread uncertainty about what's in store for public schools under the first Republican administration in eight years. Aside from school choice, Trump, a New York-based real estate developer who has never before held public office, spent little time talking about K-12 education during his campaign. And he has no record to speak of on the issue for insights into what he may propose.\n\"We're all engaging in a lot of speculation because there hasn't been a lot of serious discussion about this, especially in the Trump campaign,\" Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at Harvard University, said in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. West has advised Republicans, including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, on education.\nTrump did propose a $20 billion plan to dramatically expand school choice for low-income students. It would use federal money to help them attend private, charter, magnet, and regular public schools of their choice. It's also designed to leverage additional state investments in school choice of up to $100 billion nationwide.\nIn the campaign, the president-elect also embraced merit pay for teachers, without offering details beyond saying he found it unfair that \"bad\" teachers sometimes earned \"more than the good ones.\" And, on the early-childhood front, he's pitched offering six weeks of maternity leave to women who do not get it through their employers, expanding the availability of dependent-care savings accounts, and offering tax incentives for employers to provide on-site day care.\nBut otherwise, the Trump campaign mostly dealt in sound bites with such controversial issues as the Common Core State Standards, the possibility of getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, and gun-free school zones.\n\"I could really see him trying to minimize any role [of the federal government in education],\" Nat Malkus, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in contemplating the implications of a Trump presidency ahead of the vote.\nWhile education is not a high-profile issue politically at the moment, it's not as if the Trump administration won't have anything to do on school policy.\nAt or near the top of the K-12 to-do list is how the new administration handles the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, the latest version of the flagship federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act that was first passed in 1965. The Education Department under President Barack Obama is relatively close to finalizing ESSA regulations governing how states hold schools accountable and how districts must show they are using federal money to supplement their state and local school budgets.\nRepublicans in Congress have been critical of both sets of proposals from the department, particularly the one governing the supplemental-money rule. In fact, 25 GOP lawmakers recently asked the department to rescind its proposal for ensuring federal funds are supplemental, not a replacement for state and local money, on the grounds that the proposal would give the department too much power over state and local budget decisions.\nThe incoming administration may be on the same page as those lawmakers, said Gerard Robinson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former state schools chief in Virginia and Florida.\n\"I think [Trump's] secretary of education will handle it differently than what we've seen from [current Secretary] John King,\" regarding the so-called supplement-not-supplant rules, Robinson said"}

Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990\u2019s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk\u2019s intention to offer shippers a \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier\u2019s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU\u2019s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n\u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company\u2019s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line\u2019s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed"}

She also has 3 children.\nThu, Mar 15, 2012 : 1:41 a.m.\nThe fear you express in this question is one many people have. Part of the reason that I hear people asking this question is that folks are really unaware of basic biology. It's really uncommon for something to happen to &quot;one&quot; kidney. The most likely thing to have happen to one kidney, is to be born without it. Donating doesn't have a mathematically significant impact upon the donor.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 5:20 p.m.\nHarry, I am an organ donor but maybe some people have religious objections? I just hope that people will consider doing it.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 3:51 p.m.\nHopefully there are people who are as generous as she is. One thing I will never understand. Why isn't every person in america an organ donor. Your dead why would you want to be buried with your organs?\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 2:29 p.m.\nNow here is a hero. Its not her job. She's not getting paid. We seem to throw around that word a lot these days.\nWed, Mar 14, 2012 : 2:27 p.m."}

Public Domain/U.S. Govt. photo.\nOn this day in 1948, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and widow of the heir to the Devonshire dukedom, died in a plane crash en route to secure her father's blessings on her second marriage. She was born on February 20, 1920, and was only 28 at the time of her death.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed JFK's father Joseph Kennedy ambassador to the Court of St. James, his daughter Kathleen spent a year and a half living in London. She was educated in London at Queen's College.\nBeautiful and spirited, she was named the \"most exciting debutante of 1938.\" In 1943 she returned to England to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross.\nDespite the opposition of her intensely Catholic mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy, known to friends as \"Kick\", married William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, a Protestant and the eldest son and heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire on May 6, 1944.\nOther than her eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. who died in a plane crash three months after the wedding, no one from the Kennedy family attended the marriage ceremony. Her husband was killed in action only four months later in World War II, and his younger brother Andrew Cavendish, married to Deborah Mitford, became the heir to the dukedom. See the newspaper report of her death on right.\nPopular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits - though more traditional members of British society found fault with her boisterousness - the dashing young widow eventually became the mistress of Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam. The couple planned to wed after Fitzwilliam's planned divorce. Instead, while on a trip to visit Joseph Kennedy Sr. and gain his blessing for their relationship, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lady Hartington died in an airplane crash in Saint-Bauzile, Ard\u00e8che, France.\nOnly her father represented the Kennedy family at her funeral. Her mother, Rose, declined to attend supposedly because of Kathleen's intention to marry outside the Catholic Church a second time.\nIt is also said that Rose Kennedy also discouraged Kathleen's siblings from attending for the same reason. Rose apparently forgave Kathleen not long thereafter, and in 1951, she was reportedly delighted that her first grandchild, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy, was named after her late daughter. However, the family requested that the child not be nicknamed Kick.\nThe Marchioness of Hartington is buried in the Cavendish family plot at Saint Peter's Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. Among the wreaths that covered her coffin was one with a handwritten note from Sir Winston Churchill. The gymnasium at Manhattanville College is named in her honor.\nOn this day in 2005 the U.S. Department of Defense changed its mind about base closings, and that was the end of Otis NG as an air base.\nThe largest New England facilities saved by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC"}

(WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up"}

Nathan Sutherland was arrested and charged with sexual assault.\nHacienda HealthCare announced Thursday that it is closing its 60-bed intermediate care facility, where a patient was raped and recently gave birth.\nThe non-profit company said the board of directors, \"after a great deal of consideration, has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate\" the facility, which is at 1402 E. South Mountain Drive.\nGov. Doug Ducey was quick to criticize the decision, calling the announcement, \"concerning\" because state agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at the facility to ensure patient safety.\n\"For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. \"Forcing this medically fragile community to move should be a last resort. Everyone's first priority should be protecting their health and safety.\"\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Economic Security were similarly upset by the announcement, calling it \"very disturbing news\" and imploring Hacienda HealthCare to work with the state moving forward.\n\"We want to find a path forward that is in the best interests of the patients \u2014 and this approach is not it,\" an emailed statement from spokeswoman Tasya Peterson says.\n\"State agencies are exhausting all efforts to bring this to a conclusion that is beneficial to the patients, some of whom have been at this facility nearly their entire lives,\" she said. \"They are the ones who should come first, without question. This approach simply does not meet that test.\"\nHacienda HealthCare says the board voted on the closure last Friday, which is also when the third party manager the company had brought on board as ordered by the state left Hacienda for good.\nIndiana-based Benchmark Human Services was on site at Hacienda last week but company officials said that at the end of last week they, \"reluctantly stopped this very important effort.\"\nDucey's office said it was aware of the board's vote because Hacienda met with state agencies on Monday morning. Though the board's vote was acknowledged, Hacienda did not provide a notice to terminate, nor did it provide a transition plan, Ptak said.\n\"In fact, through today discussions continued around developing an ongoing plan to ensure the care of patients at the facility,\" he wrote in a message Thursday evening.\nHacienda HealthCare officials on Thursday said they will begin to transition clients and eventually will cease to operate the facility.\nIn its most recent federal survey, Hacienda's intermediate care facility had 39 patients ranging in age from 16 to 68. Most were described as \"non-ambulatory.\" Hacienda officials on Thursday say their patient count is now at 37.\n\"Given what happened recently it's not surprising and I don't think it's going to break too many people's hearts that a facility that did such a poor job of taking care of vulnerable adults is no longer in business,\" said Jon Meyers, executive director of The Arc of Arizona, a non-profit advocacy organization that represents Arizonans with intellectual disabilities.\nBut the problem is that families have no other private alternative in Arizona, which is yet another disservice to the individuals with intellectual disabilities who rely on them for care, Meyers added.\nAll the other intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities are operated by the state, and most don't have the capacity to handle individuals who live at Hacienda, he said.\nThe"}

I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is : Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't.

This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere's no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar. Researchers are finding that paleo diets may offer potential benefits. A small randomized study found that adhering to a paleo diet for three months improved blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors in participants with Type 2 diabetes. The results were published in the journal \"Cardiovascular Diabetology\" in July 2009.\nFroek, Barbara. \"Alternatives to Cordain's Paleo Diet.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/alternatives-cordains-paleo-diet-11384.html.

Another pharmacy employee, who gave her name only as Norma, said the increased federal security that arrived this week appeared to have done little to discourage the Knights Templar cartel, which has subjected local residents to systematic extortion for years.\nBut federal forces have other challenges, as well. The local police in Apatzingan were considered so untrustworthy that the entire 300-man force was relieved of duty and sent out of town for background checks.\nOfficials from the federal and Michoacan state governments met until late Tuesday with leaders of \u201cself-defense\u201d groups.\nWhile refusing to give up their weapons, vigilante leaders appeared to be seeking a cooling of tensions.\n\u201cWe have to be discreet with our weapons and not move up and down the highways with them,\u201d said Hipolito Mora, a lime grower who leads the self-defense group in the town of La Ruana, after the meeting.\nInterior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed the talks had taken place, and said the government was offering jobs as police to qualified members of the self-defense forces.\nThe spokesman for the vigilante movement, Estanislao Beltran, previously said the vigilantes weren\u2019t interested in such offers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want jobs as policemen. We\u2019re fighting for the freedom of our families,\u201d he said.\nThe talks came after soldiers clashed with townspeople in Antunez, where at least two men were reportedly killed during the confrontation that began late Monday. Video of the clash aired by Milenio Television showed a chaotic scene in which angry townspeople scuffled with soldiers and apparently tried to grab the gun and equipment of at least one soldier.\nThe unrest is in a region of Michoacan known as Tierra Caliente, a farming area rich in limes, avocados and mangos where vigilante groups have been trying to drive out the Knights Templar drug cartel. After a weekend of firefights, the government announced Monday that it would take on security duties in the area.\nThroughout Tuesday, federal police officers and soldiers set up roadside checkpoints just yards from roadblocks manned by vigilantes on routes into towns controlled by self-defense groups, but there were no attempts to take weapons from the civilians.\nOne federal officer who was not authorized to speak to the press said they had no orders to disarm anyone, or to try to take towns held by vigilantes, who have surrounded Apatzingan, which is said to be a Knights Templar stronghold"}

They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are crowds waiting in the bar.\nPart of the draw is James Paskins, the restaurant's chef and owner, who acquired a following during his years at the Coach Grill, also in Oyster Bay. His wife and other family members efficiently handle the front of the house. Another crowd pleaser is the reasonable prices. Entrees start at $11 and top out at $18.\nLaura's, named for Mr. Paskins's late mother, looks much as it did last year, when 68 West Main was at this location. It is spacious and comfortable. The dining room is defined by white columns, carved molding, smoky mirrors and crystal chandeliers. In a town filled with casual cafes, Laura's smart good looks make it stand out.\nOne new feature is the entrance through the bar. This, no doubt, eliminates drafts in the dining room but the crowded, smoky bar does not make a positive first impression. The dining room, however, is a place of charm and serenity.\nOther salad sensations are a just-right Caesar and a plate of grilled vegetables served atop baby greens with a balsamic vinaigrette as a dipping sauce. The seafood salad carries a price tag ($12) that is higher than some entrees, but this abundant assembly could be a main course. It stars jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, calamari, scungilli, chopped peppers, red onions, celery and black olives in a lemon-basil vinaigrette.\nOther openers I would order again are tender clams oreganata with a refreshingly spare use of bread crumbs, New Zealand mussels in a sherry pink sauce enlivened by spicy, smoky andouille sausage, a huge crab cake made lighter by the inclusion of shredded vegetables and two big portobellos served on a bed of grilled tomatoes and baby spinach. One creation that does not work, though, is the smoked-salmon-crusted-oysters. The delicate bivalves never had a chance. The assertive bready topping was too much for them. Every day a different homemade ravioli ($13) is featured. On my visit, they were filled with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives and tossed with big chunks of succulent chicken, chopped tomatoes, broccoli and an abundance of garlic. A winner! Another tasty pasta pick was fettuccine hidden under a mountain of sliced shell steak, three types of mushrooms and a chunky tomato sauce.\nFish were all cooked with precision. The herb-crusted tuna was rare as ordered and a special of striped bass in a tomato-basil sauce was moist and flaky as was sauteed tilapia in a mushroom-lemon-wine sauce.\nGood meat selections include chicken medallions in a brown sauce spiked with bourbon and touched with cream, a juicy grilled rib eye, a tasty shell steak marinated in teriyaki sauce and a memorable rack of lamb special, served pink as ordered, atop a bed of barely wilted baby spinach.

And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island.

Eyford told the PM that genuine engagement with First Nations is the only path left. For a variety of reasons, selling the pipeline to First Nations leaders is now an unofficial panic situation.\nAs things now stand, the odds are against a deal with West Coast bands on the pipeline that is supposed to carry Alberta bitumen through British Columbia and out to Asian markets.\nFrom industry and government\u2019s perspective, time is of the essence.

But compared to my fellow guests, I was something of a counterrevolutionary, a wrecker, an ideological deviationist serving the interests of the bourgeoise. Or the CIA. Or USAID. A particularly radical panelist, one of those sad little political pilgrims always sniffing out the next Third World utopia, had argued in the days after Chavez's death that \"the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that Ch\u00e1vez was authoritarian but that he wasn\u2019t authoritarian enough.\"\nMy academic co-panelist, so disappointed in Chavez\u2019s apparently mild form of Castroism, can rejoice in the disastrous but sufficiently authoritarian rule of his chosen successor, the former bus driver and Chavez confidante Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the Cuban-trained Maduro, who has variously claimed to have seen Chavez\u2019s ghost in bird form and reported that his mentor\u2019s apparition was spotted loitering in the Caracas subway system, rendered the autocrat-versus-dictator debate moot this week when he ordered the arrest of the handsome, telegenic, and Harvard-trained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. It was Lopez and his allies who helped organize a series of protest marches in the past week, during which three people were brutally gunned down--and the weight of evidence, much of it marshalled by the usually pro-government newspaper \u00daltimas Noticias, suggests that all three were killed by Maduro\u2019s goon squads.\nSo naturally, the government ordered the arrest of...Lopez.\nAnd yesterday, at the start of a large\u2014and illegal\u2014opposition march (the government had a counter demonstration, which oddly wasn\u2019t declared illegal), Lopez gave a short speech and turned himself over to the National Guard. It was an astoundingly brave bit of defiance; after all, is there a place on Earth worse than the inside of a Venezuelan prison? And a lesser man, like myself, would have sprinted to the airport and hopped the next flight to Miami. But there was Lopez, after having tenderly kissed and bid farewell to his wife, being wrenched into a waiting police van, a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a clutch of white flowers in the other. A picture that perfectly illustrated the death blow to Venezuelan democracy"}

Many banks are open limited hours on weekends, but most will be closed to observe the Veterans Day holiday on Saturday, November 11.

He was 62 and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire, England.\nThe cause was complications of cancer and intestinal surgery, his family said in a statement.\nMr. Gibb had been hospitalized for intestinal problems several times in the last two years. Cancer had spread from his colon to his liver, and in the weeks before his death he had pneumonia and for a while was in a coma.\nMr. Gibb was the second Bee Gee and third Gibb brother to die.

(Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in Manchester, England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.\nAccording to Bee Gees lore, the boys\u2019 first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.\nThe family moved to Australia in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees \u2014 for Brothers Gibb \u2014 began scoring local hits and appearing on television.

Ali was the last prominent leader of Jamaat to face execution.\nThe war crimes tribunal set up by the government has divided the country, with supporters of Jamaat and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party branding it a sham aimed at eliminating their leaders.\nAli was convicted in November 2014 of a series of crimes during Bangladesh's war of separation from Pakistan, including the abduction and murder of a young independence fighter.\nHis son, Mir Ahmed Bin Quasem, who was part of his legal defence team, was allegedly abducted by security forces earlier in August, which critics say was an attempt to sow fear and prevent protests against the execution."}
{"idx": "326", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: PARIS \u2013 French children go to school four days a week. They have about two hours each day for lunch. And they have more vacation than their counterparts almost anywhere in the West.\nIt may sound a bit like the famously leisurely work pace enjoyed by their parents, most of whom work 35 hours per week as dictated by law.\nBut the nation&apos;s new government says elementary school kids risk classroom burnout, and is moving to help them cope. The issue: French school days may be relatively few, but they are at least as long as a day of work for adults. Even 6-year-olds are in class until late into the afternoon, when skies are dark, attention flags and stomachs rumble.\nAs a candidate, President Francois Hollande promised to change things by adding a fifth day of classes on Wednesday while shortening the school day. For France, it&apos;s something of a revolutionary idea that would overturn more than a century of school tradition. The thinking is that the days are too full for young children under the current system and that Wednesday free time could be put to more productive use.\n\"France has the shortest school year and the longest day,\" Hollande said at the time, promising change.\nHis education minister, Vincent Peillon, will decide this month how to carry out the reform. He has said he may also compensate for a shorter school day by trimming France&apos;s sacred summer vacation. A panel of experts will present their conclusions on Friday, and the president is expected to address the issue on Tuesday.\nNo proposal affects tradition \u2014 and potentially family and municipal budgets \u2014 as much as what the French call changes to the \"scholastic rhythms.\"\nThere&apos;s been a midweek break in French primary schools dating back to the 19th century, a government concession to the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted children to study the catechism on their weekday off. In today&apos;s secular France, Wednesdays currently are a blur of sports, music, tutoring for families of means, or a scramble for working parents struggling to get by \u2014 who must either find a sitter or send their kids to a full day at a state-run \"leisure center.\"\nThings aren&apos;t exactly easy for French kids.\nDespite long summer breaks and the four-day school week, French elementary school students actually spend more hours per year in school than average \u2014 847, compared with 774 among countries in OECD, a club of wealthy nations. But the time is compressed into fewer days each year. The French school day begins around 8:30 and ends at 4:30 p.m., even for the youngest, despite studies showing the ability of young children to learn deteriorates as the day goes on.\nBut many parents are afraid that the changes will force them to figure out extra childcare five days a week, especially at schools where the afterschool program amounts to sitting silently at a desk for two hours or near-chaos in the play areas. Under the education proposal, school would end at lunchtime on Wednesday.\n\"It&apos;s completely unrealistic,\" Valerie Marty, president of the national parents&apos; organization, said of the proposed timetable. \"They have to figure out who will take care of the children after school, who will finance it.\"\nIn France, the answer is usually the government.\nThe state is expected to provide for just about everything education-related: Classes come under the national budget, and lunches and leisure are the domain of municipalities.

For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty \u2014 take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorg"}

They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a \u201ctruly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,\u201d the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe\u2019s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko\u2019s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements.

Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices.

Polls now demonstrate this to be true.\nWhen our children are being shot at and killed in their schools, or movie theaters, we have to take meaningful action. These tragedies are too frequent, and are, as the president said, heartbreaking.\nWe need to talk about gun laws. We need an open and honest debate about the tragedies happening in our communities, one after another. There are common-sense laws that can help prevent these tragedies, and Americans support them.\nThe \u201cFix Gun Checks Act,\u201d if passed, would make it tougher for the mentally ill to legally buy guns by strengthening background checks so people like James Holmes (the Aurora shooter) can\u2019t acquire guns. Ninety percent of Americans want to fix gaps in government databases that allow the mentally ill or drug users from buying guns. Even gun owners support the laws.\nEighty-two percent of gun owners (National Rifle Association and non-NRA members) believe that a criminal background check should be required for anyone purchasing a gun, according to data released by Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns earlier this year, 76 percent of gun owners support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, 80 percent support mandatory gun safety training for anyone applying for a concealed permit, and 78 percent of gun owners believe that concealed permits should only be granted to applicants who have not committed violent misdemeanors.\nThe NRA, which fights against all this, is out of touch \u2014 even with its own membership. Its power to dictate this debate has to be challenged.\nThe data on assault weapons is just as telling. The man identified Friday as the gunman, Adam Lanza was armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle and the killers in Aurora and Portland both used an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle. Sixty-three percent of Americans said they favor a nationwide ban on assault weapons, according to a 2011 CBS/New York Times poll, and 63 percent favored banning high-capacity magazines that hold many rounds of ammunition.\nWe found, in a 2011 survey we conducted for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, that 57 percent of Americans support a law that would limit the size of ammunition clips so that the gun could not fire more than 10 bullets without having to be reloaded. Only a third, or 34 percent, of Americans opposed that law.\nThe Brady Bill, which expired under President George W. Bush, and that Obama said he supported, regulated these kinds of assault weapons (AR-15). Those guns are now unregulated and the result is tragedy after tragedy that won\u2019t end until elected leaders step up.\nSupport for sounder, safer gun laws is not restricted to blue states or big urban cities. In a study conducted by Lake Research Partners earlier this year in swing state-senate districts in Virginia, we found that two-thirds of voters (65 percent) in a rural western Virginia district believe the gun laws should be made stronger \u2014 including 52 percent who strongly believe so.

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team\u2019s leading scorer means the Heat\u2019s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh\u2019s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra\u2019s idea of \u201cpositionless basketball,\u201d but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bosh is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three \u201cfrontcourt players\u201d and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn\u2019t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n\u2022 The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple.

And of those ways -- throwing out runners, passed balls (don't you ever use catcher's ERA, ever) - that's about 1/10th of the responsibilities of the position. And because of that, any stat - namely Win Above Replacement player (WAR) - that uses a defensive metric is kind of flawed when it comes to catchers. So much of a catcher's responsibility cannot be measured or quantified with numbers. I was converted to catcher in college (ate my way out of second base), and played the position for three years. The amount of things that went into just one game were overwhelming - and that was at the NAIA level. So at the big league level? It's ridiculous. It's why I kind of just shrugged my shoulders on WAR comparisons of John Jaso and Mike Morse.\nOne thing that would be interesting is the 40-man roster move the Mariners would make if they sign Shoppach. Who do they designate for assignment? Would it be another young player like Yoervis Medina, or would the Mariners part ways with Mike Carp, who seems to have no place on the team.\nAs for other free agents .... outfielder Michael Bourn met with the Mets (see what I did there?). If you notice in the Sherman story, he views it as a long shot. Why? Well according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, Bourn's agent - Scott Boras - wants 5-years at $15 million per year. And if anyone knows what Boras wants, it would be Heyman.\nFrom what I've been told, there hasn't been a ton of discussion about Bourn in the Mariners' front office. I'm guessing the idea of $75 million is a little too much of a commitment, particularly with their push to sign Felix Hernandez to a contract extension. Of course, that could change if the asking price went down a little. But how often does Boras' asking price go down? Would Bourn help the Mariners? Yes. He would give them a legitimate lead-off hitter that they don't have and another defensive presence in the outfield. Having Bourn and Gutierrez in the same outfield could offset any defensive issues in left field. But I'd be surprised if they go this route. And it's not because they are worried about giving up their first round pick (No. 12 overall) as compensation.\nThe Mariners are still hoping to add a veteran pitcher as well.

However, it seemed that in a bid to absolve itself from the blunder and the chaotic situation, the SLR kept on stating that they are hoping to send the team but it never materialized.\nWhat was really baffling was the comment made to the media by one of the top ranked SLR officials, where he said: \u201cWhen it comes to such high profile tournaments, the Ministry of Sports is funding only the teams which have clear opportunity to secure a medal.\u201d Such a statement, it appears gives the impression that SLR was under-prepared.\nThe Women\u2019s Tuskers did reasonably well in the Asian 7\u2019s circuit in 2017 just a few months prior to the Asian Games under the watchful eyes of Sudath Sampath (Head Coach), Inthie Marikkar (Director, High Performance), and Dilan Zoysa (Trainer). Going by some of their performances of this tournament especially of Sri Lanka\u2019s losing margins to Hong Kong (5-10) and Kazakstan (0-12); and the fact that Sri Lanka beat Thailand (24-12 to win the Plate championship) who incidentally lost the bronze medal to Kazakhstan at Asian Games speaks volumes of Sri Lanka\u2019s bright chances. While Japan won the Gold, the Silver went to China. So the top four teams at the Asian Games finally stand as Japan, China, Kazakstan and Thailand. Where would Sri Lanka been placed had they participated?\nIt is indeed a very sad state of affairs why the SLR officials just could not do their home work to come out with a sound assessment. Surely, the authorities who are top administrators in their own rights (may not necessarily be well conversant in sports) would have possibly understood the prospect of a medal on a general analytical perspective. How on earth did the Sri Lanka hockey administrators able to convince the authorities to field a men\u2019s team and got humiliated by India 20 goals to nil at the Asian Games. In that context, the SLR surely had all the rights to impress the authorities. Where did the think-tanks of SLR go wrong? The rugby fraternity\u2019s only hope would be to see that SLR conducts its affairs more sensibly in the future.\nFurthermore what\u2019s really shocking was that 180 athletes and nearly 70 odd officials amounting to a total of approximately 250 people had participated at this year\u2019s Asian Games representing Sri Lanka while depriving the prospect medalists, the women Tuskers. In the overall assessment, it was the 4 x 400 men\u2019s relay team and Men\u2019s 7\u2019s rugby team did perform well to secure fourth place.

Millennials received this info gratefully; finally, a thing we were not responsible for, an errand we did not actually have to do. Unfortunately, this is wrong; in fact, everyone should get the flu shot.\nLast year\u2019s flu season was the worst in a decade, worse than the year of swine flu. Over 80,000 people died. There are many factors at work, but a big one that medical professionals attributed to the unusually high rate of deaths and infections was a drop in the rate of adults who bothered to get their shot \u2014 yes, those same people between the ages of 18 and 65 who \u201cdon\u2019t need\u201d it.\nTo think about vaccines as they affect each person individually is blinkered; sure, you don\u2019t want to get sick, but more than vaccines prevent individual illness, they prevent illnesses from spreading. We see this already with children in locations where it\u2019s trendy among parents to simply not get their kids vaccinated from preventable diseases like measles out of irrational fears; because of those parents, those diseases spread faster and people die more frequently. Epidemics happen because of new, wild, aggressive disease strains, but they also happen for lack of prevention. More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn\u2019t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don\u2019t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don\u2019t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself.

We still don\u2019t know, but it appears that something concrete happened against the background of a market that was already tripwire nervous over Greece and the euro and China and whatnot.\nConsidering that the giant decline happened on pretty much *no* volume, I think other factors are at work. I believe the core problem here was a real order imbalance with lots of volume (which took us down the original 350), then nyse halts these stocks, the market orders get rereouted (regnms and all) to ECN\u2019s where there is much less liquidity, and what liquidity is normally there is mostly provided by the nefarious HF strats who were rightly scaling back risk. So the 10K shares that might have been a downtick on nyse blows throught the BATS book completely.\nIn English, this means that when trading started to get too hot and heavy, the New York Stock Exchange stepped in to slow things down. In the old days, this would have worked, but not anymore. Most trading of NYSE stocks doesn\u2019t actually happen on the NYSE anymore, it happens on electronic communication networks (ECNs) like BATS in Kansas City, which is the third-largest stock exchange in the world. So what the algo guy is saying is that when the NYSE tried to slow things down, the computers responsible for program trading just switched their orders over to ECNs. Unfortunately, ECNs are largely used by high-frequency trading shops, and the HFT guys closed up when the market went kablooey. So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI\u2019m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we\u2019ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don\u2019t seem to. Our financial system really needs a little bit of sand in the gears to bring it back down to human speeds.

After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That\u2019s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road. The animals there eat and drink all day to stay healthy and be able to produce lots and lots of good quality milk.\n\u201cWe milk our buffaloes twice in 24 hours \u2014 at 4am and 4pm,\u201d says Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the staff supervisors at Shaukat Mukhtar Farms. There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n\u201cEating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,\u201d he says. To ensure that the dairy workers don\u2019t get kicked in the face by the buffaloes, they also lightly tie up their hind legs while milking them.\nAsked why they don\u2019t have pumps for milking, he explains that there are pumps too at several dairy farms in Bhains Colony, but at their farms they prefer to milk by hand. \u201cUsually, we use pumps to milk cows, not buffaloes. Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows\u2019 milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,\u201d he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. \u201cIt contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. \u201cFresh milk is warm.

Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not \u201cpicture postcard perfect\u201d, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biof\u00e1n, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea ar\u00eate, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view. By now for us, the mist had thickened, adding even more to the age-old elemental \u201cfeel\u201d of the place.\nWe meandered carefully the indentations of the coast, staying inside a restraining ditch and fence, joined the marked trail to our car in Port and stood beside the memorial to the 19 crew members lost on the \u201cSydney\u201d in November 1870. Meanwhile, the arriving rain and enshrouding mist, and thoughts of the terror of the sea as well as its beauty, added a sombre note to the end of our hike!\nSuitability: easy to moderate, care needed on off-trail sections near cliff edges, especially in windy weather."}

Others, like the most reform-minded of his inner circle, Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, warn of impending dictatorship. Yet even they have warm words for him.\nMr. Gorbachev's reformist critics fall into two camps. One is composed of radicals who favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. They, along with those who cheer them on from outside, call for Mr. Gorbachev's overthrow. But they've always underestimated his radicalism and his perseverance, while overestimating their own support.\nThe other camp consists of reformers who have grown disenchanted with the pace of change. They fear that he has been co-opted by apparatchiks who identify freer speech and markets with chaos.\nBut these critics do not include Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Yakovlev. The real enemy, they still say, is not Mr. Gorbachev but the forces of reaction deeply entrenched in Moscow's ministries, the security forces, Communist Party apparatus and regional military commands.\n\"We are witnessing the rise of a vengeful and merciless conservative wave,\" Mr. Yakovlev said last week. \"I'm extremely worried by the indifference and fatigue of the democratic forces.\"\nNow both he and Mr. Shevardnadze are on the outside looking in. And both may have lost power on what is now the central issue confronting Mr. Gorbachev -- how to reconstitute the Union.\nBoth men favor decentralization to allow reformers in the Russian Republic to plunge ahead, while republics in Central Asia proceed more slowly. And they want to cede more power to the republics as a way for leaders who favor the Union to head off independence movements. The exceptions are the Baltic republics; Mr. Yakovlev admits that they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, implying they eventually deserve independence.\nSuch fine distinctions seem to be lost on Mr. Gorbachev just now. The immediate task, as he sees it, is to restore order. And to do so he has turned to the bureaucracy, the military and the K.G.B.\nThe great fear -- not only in Moscow but also in Washington -- is that Mr. Gorbachev's alliance of convenience will restore the reactionaries and torpedo reform. That could happen.\nBut the social revolution has moved too far for any lasting return to the days of Stalin, or even Brezhnev. No longer a peasant society, the Soviet Union is increasingly urban, educated and cosmopolitan. Mr. Gorbachev knows all that, and more: he knows that technological accomplishment cannot proceed without freer discussion and that social renewal cannot come without relaxing central command. For now, and as long as the transformation of the Soviet"}

However, Application Performance Management as a discipline has gained popularity in the past decade.\nLet me first introduce what I mean by APM 1.0. The enterprise applications and technologies such as Java have evolved in past two decades. The APM 1.0 tools were invented more than a decade back and they provided great benefits to resolve application issues that were prevalent with the early versions of Java and .NET technologies. However Java/.NET application servers have become mature and do not have those challenges any more. Also enterprise application architecture and technologies have changed drastically and the APM 1.0 tools have not kept up. The following figure shows the evolution of enterprise Java in the past 15 years and when APM 1.0 and APM 2.0 tools have started emerging.\nFollowing are few challenges with the APM 1.0 tools that you will run into when trying to manage your enterprise applications.\nThe application owner and the application support team primarily cares about the user experience and service level delivered by their applications. APM 1.0 tools were primarily built to monitor applications from an application infrastructure perspective.\nThese tools lack the capabilities to monitor applications from real user perspective and help you isolate application issues whether it is caused by the network, load balancers, ADNs such as Akamai, or the application, database, etc. Some of these solutions were quick to add some basic end-user monitoring capabilities such as synthetic monitoring. However an application support personnel has to switch between multiple consoles and depend on manual correlation between end-user monitoring and application deep dive monitoring tools.\nThese tools do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. That means you are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nAPM 1.0 deep-dive monitoring tools were primarily built to diagnose issues during the application development lifecycle. These tools morphed into production deep-dive monitoring tools when the need arose for APM in production environments. So, These tools were not optimized for production monitoring and hence require a lot of effort to tune for production.\nFirst off, the complexities of agent installation and configuration hinder deployment in production environment. Second, these tools usually require configuration changes every time new application code is rolled out.\nMost damagingly, they have high overhead on application performance and do not scale beyond 100-150 application servers. This means that most customers use these in a test environment or enable deep-dive monitoring retroactively after an application failure - assuming the problem will recur.\nFinally, these tools do not provide operation friendly UIs and because they were originally built for developers.\nAs I alluded earlier, the old generation APM tools are very complex to configure because these require application knowledge, manual instrumentation and complex agent deployment. Hence expensive consultants are required to deploy and configure and maintain these tools. These tools also have multiple consoles - adding to total cost of ownership. Some customers told me that they spend a lot of time managing these APM tools rather than being able to manage their applications.\nThese tools were built more than a decade back, and have not evolved much although the application architecture, technologies and methodologies have gone though drastic changes.\nAPM 1.0 tools certainly cannot satisfy these needs.

It determines whether your bank will lend you money to buy a house or car; whether your landlord will accept you as a tenant; which employers will hire you and how much they will pay you. It can even affect your marriage prospects.\nAnd in the present Reputation Economy, it\u2019s getting more powerful than ever. Because today, thanks to rapid advances in digital technology, anyone access huge troves of information about you your buying habits, your finances, your professional and personal networks, and even your physical whereabouts at any time. In a world where technology allows companies and individuals alike to not only gather all this data but also aggregate it and analyze it with frightening speed, accuracy, and sophistication, our digital reputations are fast becoming our most valuable currency.\nToday everything depends on the social score, and everyone is desperate to move up in the rankings. But the omnipresent rating game has one big catch: ranking up is incredibly hard, while ranking down is rapid and easy, like a free-fall.Welcome to the reputation economy, where the individual social graph the social data set about each person determines one\u2019s value in society, access to services, and employability. In this economy, reputation becomes currency.\nOn the web or via mobile, we can now share almost anything. The reputation economy is based on the simplistic, but effective star ratings system. Anyone who\u2019s ever rated their Uber driver or Airbnb host has actively participated. But what happens when algorithms, rather than humans, determine an individual\u2019s reputation score based on multiple data sources and mathematical formulas, promising more accuracy and more flexibility via machine learning to effective star ratings system. promising more accuracy and more flexibility via machine learning?\nOver 60% of companies in Malta currently use social media to screen employees. And many AI-enabled startups are competing in the HR assessment market, using AI to crawl potential candidates\u2019 social media accounts to filter out bad fits. What unifies all current platforms is a reliance on our ability to get enough information about the person we are exchanging with to feel comfortable setting the terms on an individual basis. In other words, they are economies of reputation.\nMuch of the growing interest in these platforms springs from the conflicts we\u2019re seeing in traditional markets. Lack of access to capital, slow market growth, poor employment rates all of these are driving people to find ways to leverage value from other areas of their lives.\nBack In 2012, Facebook applied for a patent that would use an algorithm to assess the credit ratings of friends, as a factor in one\u2019s eligibility to get a mortgage. And China is aiming to implement a national social score for every citizen by 2020, based on crime records, their social media, what they buy, and even the scores of their friends.\nBeing able to accurately or even reasonably accurately measure reputation has immense value. It makes it far easier to find suppliers or business partners and this lowering of transaction cost can create a far more fluid and efficient economy. If you are investing in or supporting small businesses especially in developing countries . It means your resources can go far further. We will increasingly have reputation scores attached to content, to publishers and to journalists, making it easier to find trustworthy information and it might even make dating a little easier. The reputation economy will increasingly drive business and society. Your reputation will precede you wherever you go."}

We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are.

The military junta in power at the time of the massacre was headed by Moussa Dadis Camara.\nThere has been real progress in justice in recent months, the groups said. The establishment of a High Judicial Council in July, the ongoing improvement in the status of judges and the start of justice reform are all likely to help the judges complete their work.\nThere has been some progress in the legal case in recent weeks, including questioning of the director of Conakry stadium, the former Minister for Youth and Sport and, through an international rogatory commission, Dadis Camara, who has taken refuge in Burkina Faso.

The government needs to guarantee that all of the people summoned for questioning, including members of the security forces, regardless of their rank, answer the summonses issued by the judges.

Because of their height, the windmills reflect other radio and television signals towards the Lofar station.\nMinister for economic affairs Henk Kamp has a year to decide whether to continue with the project. The plan has already been criticized by local residents and municipalities.\nThe Dutch telecom agency is currently looking into whether windmills interfere with radio telescope operation in Drenthe.\nMinister Kamp gave the project the go-ahead based on a study by a British company, which found that the operation of the telescope would not suffer if windmills were placed nearby. However, Astron argues that the British researchers didn\u2019t have sufficient knowledge to make that claim.\nAstronomers at the Lofar site would prefer if the windmills were at least 15km away from the telescope. The current plan would see seven of the fifty turbines placed within a 15km radius of the Lofar site.\n\u2018It might not sound like too much of a difference, but going from a few kilometres to fifteen really makes a big difference when it comes to the strength of the reflected signals,\u2019 said Garrett."}

Love \u2018em or hate \u2018em, the Moto Z phones have something that other phones just don\u2019t. The new Moto Z2 Force and Moto Z2 Play have magnetic Mods that snap onto the back of them, adding new features. What you think about those Mods will determine whether either of the two Moto Z2 phones are right for you.\nWhatever you\u2019re doing, Moto wants to have a Mod for that. Snap on a battery pack if you\u2019re going off grid, or maybe a 360-degree camera so you can capture everything on that nature hike. Pop on a speaker and you can pump up the jams, or attach Motorola\u2019s brand new Polaroid printer Mod that lets you instantly print out any photo you take. You can even buy a Mod that turns your phone into an Amazon Echo speaker, complete with a glowing blue ring.\nThere are more than a dozen of these Mods, and they all magnetically cling to the back of the rather svelte Z2, which feels almost too thin and flat without one. Moto Mods are the defining reason to buy a Moto Z2 Play and its more expensive sibling, the Z2 Force. But they don\u2019t come cheap. Many of these doodads cost upward of a hundred bucks.\nMy Moto Z2s have worn a lot of Mods in the last few weeks. I found most of them fun, but I didn\u2019t want to keep any of them snapped on forever. Many of them make the phone a little too fat. My favorite was a battery pack, which I kept in my back and snapped on whenever I had a long day ahead of me. Oddly, I rarely needed it. Both the Z2 Force and Play get excellent battery life without augmentation. I was able to use the Z2 Play for two days straight after forgetting to charge it, though it was gasping for a charge by the second evening. That kind of battery life is hard to come by these days.\nBoth Moto Z2 phones are nearly identical from the outside. They have large glass 5.5-inch screens above a nice fingerprint sensor. The sides and back are smooth, brushed aluminum with a large circular bump for the rear camera. Ridges on the power button make it easy to distinguish from the volume keys, all of which sit on the right side of the phone.

Lauletta did not play against the Bears but made his NFL debut with a 40-0 fourth-quarter lead against the Redskins.\nLauletta went 0-for-5 with an interception as the Giants won 40-16.\nRookie quarterback Kyle Lauletta debuted for Giants in the 40-16 blowout win against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, December 9, 2018 (12/9/18) at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. His teammates and Richmond coaches say there is much more coming than the box score showed.\nThe Giants did not hide their disappointment with Lauletta after the game.\n\"I don't think we had enough there to evaluate how he did,\" coach Pat Shurmur said after the game. \"I would've liked a couple more completions and to not throw that interception, certainly.\n\"We felt like, 'OK, let's take a look at him and see.' I fielded enough questions regarding Kyle Lauletta that we were interested in seeing him. Hopefully, you got a chance to see what you were looking for.\"\nIf the true reason the Giants were interested in seeing him was because of the amount of media questions about him in the weeks when the team started 1-7, that is troubling.\nAfter all, they used a fourth-round pick on Lauletta when an offensive tackle, pass-rusher or cornerback could've helped immediately.\nIf the Giants feel Lauletta is far off being able to play in a game, that is more of a question of the pick than of the people asking if he should be inserted into a game during a lost season, especially considering Giants owner John Mara saying it was a mistake not to play a rookie quarterback (Davis Webb) last season.\nShurmur said Wednesday that Lauletta was the No. 2 quarterback but subject to change. He also declined to commit to a backup quarterback when asked Friday.\nAsked if he saw anything encouraging from Lauletta beyond the box score, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shula succinctly said, \"Yeah, he got experience.\"\nThe Giants still are alive in the NFC playoff race and can't be eliminated this weekend if they beat the Titans. A loss spells elimination.\nWill the Giants re-open the door for Lauletta under those circumstances? Shurmur admitted more evaluation is needed, but Lauletta is going the wrong way on the depth chart, rather than nipping at Manning's heels to be the starter in 2019.\nManning has stepped up his play of late, with the Giants offense averaging more than 28 points per game during a 4-1 stretch over the last five games.\nThe purpose of the switch back to Tanney is unclear, though Shurmur does like having a veteran quarterback as a backup on gamedays.\nOnce he made the"}

Most have tended to be the size of mobile homes, so that they can be built at the universities and shipped to the decathlon, and then shipped home. Most entries act like mobile homes, being detached buildings that will stand alone.\nThe DPD is a uniquely syncretic product of our study of two proven traditional housing typologies born of different cultures.

He said the system with which he had become identified had no future. Whether motivated by conscience or survival, his unexpected resignation elicited wild cheers and seemed to signal the beginning of the end for black township governments.\nMr. Boya, who is 39 years old, said the handwriting appeared on the wall after the African National Congress was made legal and Nelson Mandela released in February. \"I realized there was no room any more for a person to serve in a structure created by the Government,\" he said.\nHis decision to quit, he said, was prompted by his inability to stop the state-owned power company from switching off Daveyton's electricity for four days recently because of unpaid bills. He said it illustrated the frustrations he had faced in Daveyton since joining its town council in 1978.\n\"The weakness of the black local authorities was simply lack of funds, lack of local sources of revenue,\" Mr. Boya said. But, he quickly added, \"the structures were illegitimate\" because the white minority Government had imposed them on blacks.\nTheir resources are not shared with the satellite black townships, which began as stark dormitories for blacks working at menial jobs in white areas and which suffer chronic poverty and unemployment.\nAnti-apartheid civic associations have organized boycotts of rent and utility payments to protest inferior living conditions, which deprive municipal governments of the modest revenue upon which they depend. The associations have accused municipal officials like Mr. Boya of being puppets of apartheid.\nSatisfied that the crisis had been resolved, Mr. Boya flew to Rio de Janeiro for a conference. In his absence, the deal collapsed when the Transvaal Provincial Administration insisted that most of the money paid go to pay municipal wages and only a little to the utility company. He returned home to find the electricity turned off and his constituents irate.\n\"I felt so lonely,\" Mr. Boya said. \"I felt rejected. I felt betrayed.\"\nThe electricity was turned back on after residents took the utility company to court.\nMr. Boya's foreboding about the future of black local government was heightened when he went to a United Municipalities conference recently and found only 8 of its 60 municipal councils represented.\nMr. Boya said he went to the other rally and decided to quit. \"You could have heard a pin when I went over to the podium,\" he said. \"I then offered my resignation.\"\nJames Ngubo, chairman of the Daveyton Interim Committee said that \"Mr. Boya coming out really symbolizes that the system is bankrupt.\" He said the white minority Government had set up Mr. Boya as a \"good black man\" to make black local authorities palatable. His group had pressed Mr. Boya to resign, Mr. Ngubo said, and the power cuts \"must have been the last straw for him.\"\nFour other Daveyton councillors have followed Mr. Boya's example.\nMr. Boya predicted the inevitable collapse of all township government structures. \"I"}

A Future Tense event.\nWill China\u2019s Scientists and Technologists Ever Be Truly Innovative?\nFrom left: Adam Segal, Denis Simon, Yifei Sun, and Steve LeVine.\nJust this week, a House of Representatives committee issued a report warning the United States against doing business with two major Chinese tech firms, ZTE and Huawei. The companies were closely tied to the Chinese government, the report said, and could be stealing information from the U.S. government and American businesses.\nIn opening remarks, Steve LeVine, Washington correspondent for Quartz magazine and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow, established the questions for the day: Can China ever become an \u201cinnovation juggernaut,\u201d just as it is a world leader in manufacturing? Does \u201cinnovation\u201d have to mean breakthroughs, or is incremental innovation\u2014small tweaks on Western-made technology to make it cheaper and sometimes better\u2014enough? And should the rest of the world be worried?\n-Creativity isn\u2019t encouraged: Segal argued that while we focus on the \u201chardware\u201d\u2014the more tangible results of innovation, like patents filed\u2014China needs to focus on the \u201csoftware\u201d problems of culture. In China, researchers aren\u2019t urged to think creatively, nor do they feel free to fail. \u201cNo risk, no reward\u201d may be a clich\u00e9, but it is also a truism.\n-Quantity is valued over quality: According to Huang, the number of journal articles published by Chinese researchers has exploded in recent years. But outside of the life sciences and biology, the level of impact from this research has remained fairly flat\u2014indicating that the research is not high-quality. In part, this may be because researchers are paid per publication, so repetitive research and short-term work is incentivized.\n-Intellectual property rights are not respected: Since patents and copyrights are frequently violated, there is less incentive to create.\nChina\u2019s leadership understands all of these things, said Segal. In fact, they have probably visited Silicon Valley \u201cmore than anyone,\u201d he joked. Accordingly, China\u2019s 2006 mid- to long-term plan for science and technology development emphasized the need for better intellectual property protection, for startup culture. But politically, introducing these elements will be very difficult\u2014especially, as Simon noted, because the politicians have other significant worries on their minds, like domestic protests.

At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure.

{"idx": "445", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The black, glossy background in the Nike store took attention away from the brand's shoes.\nIn February, I visited Nike and Adidas' flagship stores in New York City.\nNike's displays were confusing, and the store didn't do enough to highlight the striking visuals that have always been one of the company's strengths.\nAdidas' design instincts were much better, and the store found a number of smart ways to allow customers to interact with products.\nThe rivalry between Nike and Adidas has been one of the top stories in athletic apparel for decades. While Nike has often landed bigger athletes for sponsorships, Adidas has surged in recent years by anticipating and responding to customer demand with stylish, versatile products that make sense for exercise or everyday use.\nNow, Nike is rethinking its retail approach in an attempt to keep Adidas from overtaking it as the top-selling athletic apparel company in the United States.\nI started at Niketown on 5th Avenue. Niketown was previously Nike's flagship store in New York City, but it closed in the spring and was replaced by a new store in November.\nThe first floor played to Nike's strengths.\nNike's acclaimed print and television ads have long played up its eye for striking visuals. Niketown's first floor reflected that skill set by highlighting images rather than products, creating excitement before customers even saw any merchandise.\nIt also promoted an inclusive, culturally relevant message. Nike's \"Equality\" ad campaign promoted diversity and tolerance.\nMost of the products shown on the first floor were inspired by that message. The items associated with the \"Equality\" campaign were some of the best I saw in the store.\nUnfortunately, the product displays (and many of the products themselves) on the other floors didn't quite live up to the hype. The store didn't have a consistent aesthetic, and many of the displays failed to highlight \u2014 and sometimes even detracted from \u2014 Nike's products.\nThe glossy black background on this display drew attention to its reflective qualities rather than the shoes.\nBasketball shoes have long been one of Nike's signature products, but Nike made some confusing decisions with its basketball shoe displays.\nPlacing a shoe off-center in the middle of a net-less basketball rim made the shoe line designed for LeBron James \u2014 perhaps Nike's most recognizable American athlete who isn't retired \u2014 look cheap rather than aspirational.\nIt didn't help that many of the shoes themselves were unattractive.\nIt would be difficult to make the raised, scale-like texture on Nike's \"Lebron 15\" shoe line look desirable in any environment. Considering the clout that Air Jordans still have with sneaker enthusiasts, it's surprising how badly Nike missed the mark with products associated with an athlete who will likely become one of the brand's most legendary icons.\nOne of Niketown's biggest problems was that it didn't consistently take advantage of Nike's best assets.\nThroughout its history, Nike has been able to land elite athletes for sponsorships more consistently than its competitors. But Niketown didn't do enough to highlight those athletes. This Lebron James display was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't reflected in the store's overall strategy.\nSome displays hinted at a strategy the store should have adopted.\nThis display for soccer shoes did a great job of creating an environment where the products could stand out, while complementing the products with"}

Palestinian children are detained without charge for months and when charged, they are tried in military courts. Gazan schools are insufficient and the funds often cut. An Israeli museum is built over a centuries old Muslim graveyard. Ancient olive trees, the livelihood of Palestinian farmers are burned. Homes are bulldozed. A blockade prevents goods from coming into and out of Palestine, inhibiting commerce and the means for a livelihood. Water is diverted from its source directly to Israel where it is abundantly available, including for swimming pools, while Palestinians have to buy water from tanker trucks. (A Durham Presbyterian church funded water purifiers for Gaza schools after the bombing of U.N. schools.) The wall closing off Israel from Palestinians makes everyday life difficult. Israeli settlements take more land from Palestinians every year. Drones fly 24 hours a day spying on and frightening the residents of Gaza.\nThe asymmetry of the two sides is extreme. A few rockets a week fall into north Israel and if they hit an Israeli citizen, Israel attacks with an over-the-top force, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians have only stones, and now knives, to express their frustration and anger.\nThose who support Israel based on religious beliefs do not realize that Palestine Christians also suffer under the burden of the Israeli occupation. The Presbyterian Church of America, and The Episcopal Peace Fellowship have spoken out about the repression in their book and DVD called, \u201cSteadfast Hope\u201d for their parishioners. It is painful to watch and read.\nPalestinian student campus organizations face bureaucratic harassment, severe restrictions on and censorship of their columns, even cancellations of their speakers. If they do win the battle to publish their viewpoint, Jewish organizations immediately spring into action to overwhelmingly deny and refute their message.\nMovies, media and games perpetuate stereotypes with Palestinians depicted as terrorists and villains, vicious gunmen, wide-eyed maniacs killing anyone, anywhere, any time for any reason. Movies and television programs such as \u201cTyrant,\u201d \u201cDig\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d depict Arabs as the lowest of human beings.\nThis in contrast to positive portrayals of Israelis, such as Ziva David as a Mossad agent in \u201cNCIS.\u201d Europeans are speaking out about the Gaza tragedy, but American voices are silenced out of fear of being accused as anti-Semitic. A major conference, \u201cThe Israel Lobby: Is It Good for the US, Is It Good for Israel?\u201d received no main stream media coverage.\nHow to get the message out? Jewish organizations inside Israel and the U.S. are working for peace and to let the world know of the suffering of the Palestinians.

He went down Saturday in one car and his parents in another.\n\u2014 Even with a GPS, things don\u2019t always work out as planned. His mother and I headed down Interstate 81 and then I-40 toward Nashville. He ended up taking I-75 toward Chattanooga at the I-81 and I-40 split east of Knoxville. However, his phone GPS directed him a different way after his southern turn and he beat us there by at least 20 minutes.\n\u2014 If you travel with a gumball machine, don\u2019t put the gumballs in until you get to your destination without a top on the machine. My ex\u2019s rear floorboard was full of gumballs before we left Kingsport.\n\u2014 If you ever make a trip to Murfreesboro, when you make the exit off I-40 to I-840, be forewarned there are no gas stations until you reach Murfreesboro, about 22 miles. We realized this as the gas gauge was about on empty. On much of I-40 there are gas stations galore, often at every exit.\n\u2014 Once we got to Mufreesboro and then campus, we relied more heavily on GPS to guide us since we weren\u2019t familiar with the campus or the city. After the third time of being directed to turn left onto Mount Sue Boulevard, I realized the GPS meant MTSU Boulevard. Hmm, Big Blue of Mount Sue? At least it rhymes.\n\u2014 Always check to be sure the dorm refrigerator works and have a checklist of items. After his refrigerator didn\u2019t cool, he told me it had been about two years since the fridge had been used. As of last word, it was still not working. I guess a new fridge might be in his future unless he snags his sister Erica\u2019s refrigerator from her old room at home. He also forgot his backpack and extra car key and remote but plans to get those, and maybe another fridge, when he visits here in September. He also didn\u2019t take his 50-plus-inch television, at least yet.\n\u2014 Listen to the keynote convocation speech. This one was by attorney Bryan Stevenson, author of \u201cJust Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,\u201d the freshmen summer reading selection. A black man who grew up on the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, he went to Harvard Law School and became a defender and champion of the downtrodden. He has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and is to do so again later this year.\nHe has spent his career fighting against racism, against other discrimination and for justice and for equality. His message was for the class of 2022 to become involved and try to make things better, to get up close and personal with people so they could make a difference just like an attorney needs to get to know about his clients before helping them.\nFunny, he didn\u2019t say a thing about GPS pronunciations, spilled gumballs and not-so-cool refrigerators. Maybe there\u2019s a book there? Future convocation keynote speech, here I come."}

This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store \u2013 for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms \u2013 my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the \u201ckeepers,\u201d which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers \u2013 Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the \u201cEpi Clipper,\u201d tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad \u2013 this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food.

That means I disbelieve in the whole ten thousand or so gods who have been held by some to be of utmost importance since hominids first stared at the stars and asked,\"Why?\"\nPeter Sellick only disbelieves in 9,999 or one less that I do.\nChristianity has only been around for 0.1% or less of the time which has elapsed since the first hominid started hunting for a living. We managed to survive without Christianity and domineering popes and other clerics for much of that time.\nIf they had their way we would go back to giving them the power over life and death as they had during the Inquisition and the Thirty Year War.\nAs Terry Lane said in a radio interview after writing \"God; The Interview\" all theologians make it up as they go along.\nPeter, I think you've explained the situation clearly. Unfortunately, apart from those who attack Christian faith from a scientistic (not merely scientific) viewpoint, there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\nThe article is not about the institution but about some concepts central to Christian understanding. And I would suggest that the Christian path is about being fully human: far more than survival.\nI may be wrong, but you seem to be suggesting that God is simply constructed to explain the material world and the position of humans in it. I think that for many people the starting point of faith in God is not an intellectual effort to find a God to fill the gaps in knowledge. Rather it is an awareness, however faint, of the presence of God in their lives. The intellectual efforts to describe and understand this awareness become what we often call theology.\nSell, I think your whole argument falls down because the Christian church believes that God becaome flesh in the form of Jesus. This is an oxymoron if you wish to continue to believe in God as a spiritual being. He may be one or the other, but not both.\n\"there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\"\nis an understatement. In a room of intellectually leaning church men and women I had the distinct feeling that I was the only one in the room that thought that God was not supernatural and who did not exist in the world as supernatural being. It seems that most of them wanted God to act somehow in the material world apart from the power of the Word in the Spirit.

{"idx": "452", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: But those numbers are actually troubling. In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a slight decline in the number of black men applying to and enrolling in medical school from 1978 to 2014, a finding unique among all demographic groups. The numbers of black men in law, business, academia and engineering are also disproportionately low.\nThe AAMC report describes some of the persistent barriers: underperforming K-12 education, lack of positive role models, negative or limiting public perceptions of African-American men. For decades, any listing of prominent African-American men would almost exclusively contain athletes and other entertainers.\nThese perceptions all too often become reality. I grew up in the 1980s in a working-class black neighborhood near Washington where sports and entertainment framed our dreams. I can\u2019t remember anyone aspiring to become an astronaut or engineer or a senator or governor. Many of us did play competitive sports in high school, and a handful made it to the college level (me included). But only one went to the pros; the rest had to face the reality of finding regular jobs. Some had serious struggles with this transition. While we encouraged one another to practice our jump shots and perfect the art of throwing and catching a football, spending more time on the education road would have surely been a better strategy.\nLet\u2019s be honest, though. Becoming Barack Obama or Ben Carson is just as unlikely as becoming Michael Jordan or LeBron James. The difference is the process and where you\u2019ll land if you fall short of their status. While going to law school (like Obama) or medical school (like Carson) isn\u2019t likely to land you anywhere near the White House, it can lead to a very comfortable life. The average annual salary for a physician, which can be earned for 30 or 40 years, is over $200,000.\nPutting all of one\u2019s efforts into sports has enabled the exceptional few to become rich while leaving the majority with resum\u00e9s ill-suited to economic success. The best sports-related options for those who don\u2019t become professional athletes (sports agent, front office executive, sportswriter or coach) usually require a college degree. Unlike our dominance on the field or court, African-American men \u2013 unless they are well-known former players \u2013 are far less likely to wind up in these ancillary positions.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Obama and Carson are so polarizing \u2013 politics has a way of glamorizing and denigrating people all at once. The shortcomings in how they are perceived underscore the need for more black men to reach the highest levels of achievement in other fields \u2013 whether it is in science, communications or business/technology. In the meantime, let\u2019s take a step back to acknowledge the important example that Obama and Carson offer to young black men.\nAnd while recent racial tensions at Duke, UNC and other colleges across America illuminate some of the challenges that black students can face in academic settings, education remains our best path toward long-term success. That\u2019s a message that my sons, and every other young black male, can\u2019t hear too much."}

All learners should speak English or Afrikaans and an African language.\nOpenness: to stimulate children to think for themselves, to be open to new ideas and hungry for knowledge; a richer reading and debating culture needs to be nurtured.\nAccountability: in a climate where public perceptions about both schools and teachers are negative, teachers need to dedicate themselves to their profession and view it as a vocation. A fellowship between all those involved in education should ensure that \u201cquality learning and teaching take(s) place\u201d.\nI promise to be loyal to my country, South Africa, and to do my best to promote its welfare and the well-being of all of its citizens.

Thus, placing the reserve limit in SB 858 would, it appeared, persuade union leaders to not oppose Proposition 2\u2019s passage and give them cover vis-\u00e0-vis their own members \u2013 even though it\u2019s unlikely that conditions for invoking the limit will be met in the foreseeable future, and school officials could probably sidestep it with creative budget-writing.\nAs the Legislature reconvened this week, the California School Boards Association demanded repeal of the limit, citing a study saying it could force districts to spend as much as $17 billion, including emergency reserves, against their better judgment.\n\u201cThis is bad law and needs to be repealed,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Josephine Lucey, declared.\nIt may have been an acceptable tradeoff to Brown, ever the pragmatist willing to set aside even his principles when political exigencies intrude. But it\u2019s still bad public policy and he has dropped hints that with Proposition 2 now passed, he might entertain repealing or modifying it.\nHowever, a Brown flip-flop, if it happens, would make the whole episode look even more cynically manipulative and would also present a political dilemma for the unions."}

The study changed international guidelines when it found that intervention to prevent serious health complications for a small baby in the womb is only required for those in the bottom 3% from a weight perspective, not the bottom 10% as previously thought.

Tarzia, first elected to the Board of Finance in 1987, had been battling several ethics violation charges at the time of his departure.\nOne charge, filed by Human Resources Generalist Tania Barnes in April 2010, alleged Tarzia asked two city employees, Director of Operations Ernie Orgera and Parks Superintendent Mickey Docimo, to intervene in the disciplining of a vehicle maintenance worker.\nAnother complaint, filed by City Fleet Manager Michael Scacco, alleged Tarzia, along with City Rep. Sal Gabriele, R-16, and Republican finance board member Bob Kolenberg, \"led a campaign of harassment and retaliation\" against him after he attempted to discipline city equipment mechanic James Fasoli.\nThe city's deal with Tarzia ended public ethics hearings on the complaints. The arrangement was a settlement of a federal lawsuit Tarzia had filed against the city in October 2010, Larobina said.\nAn ethical dilemma: Who should pay?\nTarzia was paid $45,000 in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, resigning from municipal office, and withdrawing all ethics complaints and Freedom of Information requests he had filed.\n\"In my mind, it was simply a question of stemming the hemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars to defend and pay legal fees to outside counsel to defend this frivolous lawsuit, that, in our opinion had no merit,\" Larobina said. \"The decision was that we would spend more money litigating and defending this suit than we would to settle it. And we do that every day. We settle lawsuits every day.\"\nCommittee Chair Eileen Heaphy asked Larobina how much money he estimated the settlement saved taxpayers.\n\"I'm sure that we would have expended at least twice or three times the amount of what we paid out in legal fees,\" Larobina said. \"The case really hadn't gone very far at that point.

It wants to enhance our abilities and prolong our lives, if not enable us to live forever. But new innovations give rise to new and tough choices, and a small but growing group of startups sees it as their mission to use technology, not to extend life, but to help people make and document some of the most difficult decisions regarding the end of it.\nThe story of a patient from her days as a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine particularly haunts Azalea Kim, co-founder of the startup TrueNorth. A 60-year-old woman, who had terminal cancer, came to the emergency room one weekend evening in dire condition. Because of a complicated family situation, Kim said, she arrived alone, without any family member to serve as an advocate and describe the kind of care she would want.\nAlthough her medical record was overflowing with documentation, the doctors were unable to locate a health care proxy form that could also have provided guidance on the kind of procedures the woman would \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t \u2013 have wanted in her final days. So, Kim explained, the doctors slipped into default mode, administering intravenous therapy, sending her to a radiologist, considering a surgical intervention and providing all kinds of aggressive and potentially unwanted care.\nPartly motivated by that experience, Kim and two Harvard Business School classmates, Margaret Terry and Amy Flaster, launched TrueNorth. A recent graduate of the Healthbox startup accelerator in Boston, TrueNorth provides a free online service for patients to record their legal healthcare proxy (or power of attorney) and then share it with loved ones and healthcare providers.\nThe goal, the founders said, is for TrueNorth to encourage patients to tackle difficult end-of-life decisions and ultimately integrate with electronic medical record systems to make these forms available in the health and emergency contexts in which they\u2019re needed.\nA planning tool on MyDirectives prompts patients to indicate their preferences and values related to end-of-life care.\nAnd it\u2019s one of a handful of relatively new startups trying to use technology to help patients think through and share their end of life decisions. For example, along with TrueNorth, the Dallas-based MyDirectives exclusively offers support around health-related decisions, while startups Everplans and AfterSteps focus on medical planning services, along with a wider range of financial and legacy planning options.\nAccording to Kim, just 25 percent of patients have documented a health care proxy or living will. And, other estimates indicate that even when a document exists, it can\u2019t be located 35 percent of the time. These companies say their digital tools help ensure that patients\u2019 voices are heard when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable or can no longer speak for themselves.\nFor example, they can walk patients through their end-of-life prioritizes, enabling them to indicate that they most value being free from pain or not being a burden to their families. They also let patients specify the circumstances in which they\u2019d want life-sustaining treatment, like heart machines and dialysis.\nAnd their rise makes sense given the growth of the so-called \u201clongevity economy\u201d of services for the aging Baby Boomer demographic, increasing awareness among patients that they need to be more proactive about their health and the digitization of healthcare \u2014 not to mention major advances in medical technology.\nAs a study from the Pew Internet & American Life pointed out earlier this month, nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for another adult or child with a serious illness. And, a big chunk of those adults are part of the workforce. According to MyDirectives, caregiving-related"}

Insecurity, returnees from north Sudan and newly displaced people from the contested region Abyei and Jonglei state have all added to the food crisis.\nAcuil said his ministry has attempted to address the problem by sending aid to Agok in Northern Bahr el Ghazal where many of the 110,000 people displaced from Abyei and its surrounding areas are residing.\n\u201cI just spoken to the chief administrator and he confirmed arrival of some of the trucks\", the minister said.\nFlash floods in Agok in early September \"compounded an already difficult situation for people displaced by conflict in Abyei in May this year\" a recent UN report said.\n\"Food insecurity of the affected households continued to be of concern as the people displaced from Abyei are largely dependent on food assistance\" the September 26 report found.\nThe minister also said that food aid was also being sent to Uror county in Jonglei State, where fighting in August killed around 600 people and displaced over 20,000, the UN estimates.\n\"The people at \u2018severe risk\u2019 may either not have enough food to eat, enough money to buy seed to plant or enough money to buy food. The prices are increasing almost every hour. I am in Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, nobody can get food at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning because people queue up at the restaurant and other local hotels for food\u201d, the minister added.\nIn many parts of the Republic of South Sudan, he said, food prices have gone up due drought and the closure of supply routes with north Sudan after partition. The situation is especially bad in the areas closest to the border with Sudan.\nAn agreement between North and South Sudan to create ten points for trade and for people to move between the two countries has yet to be implemented.\nMinister Acuil said his government was working with donors to invest in irrigation systems to increase crop production.\n\"Urgent action is needed to prevent a looming humanitarian and food crisis in this country\", said Acuil.\nHe added that more than 11,000 people returning to South Sudan are in Renk awaiting transportation, explaining that local resources have been overstretched.\nIn order to address the food shortages the United Nations World Programme (WFP) is helping South Sudan\u2019s government by constructing new roads to improve humanitarian access and allow agriculture goods to be brought to market.\nLakes state Governor Chol Tong Mayay, speaking at the inauguration of two roads being built in Rumbek East County, pledged unconditional support and cooperation of his administration to facilitate humanitarian"}

In a deathly quiet visitors\u2019 clubhouse, players sat motionless in front of their lockers late Wednesday night, seemingly stunned by the realization that their misery could reach new depths.\nYoshihisa Hirano, only recently given the reins in the closer\u2019s role, became the latest Diamondbacks reliever to get beat in excruciating fashion, serving up D.J. LeMahieu\u2019s opposite-field, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth of a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\nThe Diamondbacks were two outs away from shaving their deficit in the National League West to just 1 1/2 games. Instead, it could grow to 4 1/2 games by the time they leave town on Thursday evening.\nHanded a 4-3 lead in the ninth, Hirano allowed a leadoff single to Gerardo Parra, a hard-hit ball that first baseman Paul Goldschmidt could not handle, and, two batters later, Hirano left a fastball over the plate that LeMahieu smacked into the right-field seats.\nThey did get a lead. They did get a solid outing from lefty Patrick Corbin. And they did get good relief work through the eighth inning. But while the ninth was a disaster, the Diamondbacks\u2019 offense once again gave the pitching staff little breathing room.\nWith one out in the fourth, Alex Avila launched a solo home run to center field to extend the Diamondbacks\u2019 lead to 4-2. It was the last baserunner the Diamondbacks would have, as the Rockies retired 17 consecutive batters through the end of the game.\nRockies relievers recorded 15 of those outs, marking the first time in the franchise\u2019s 25-year history the bullpen recorded five perfect innings.\nIt was the eighth consecutive game decided by one run that the Diamondbacks have lost.

And yet, from its comic title to the wistful smile that accompanies its over-too-soon last shot, Andersson\u2019s delightfully odd \u201cA Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\u201d finds the Swedish master of comic absurdity feeling downright generous, perched at a comfortable enough distance from this coterie of sad sacks and lonelyhearts to recognize the humor in such painful subjects as mortality, aging, unpaid debts and unrequited love.\nJust last year, Ethan Hawke was quoted as referring to \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d and its two sequels as \u201cthe lowest-grossing trilogy in the history of motion pictures.\u201d But even he probably hasn\u2019t bought tickets to Andersson\u2019s incomparable triptych \u2014 rapturously received by critics, though audiences have proven all but allergic to the first two films, which have cleared barely $100,000 so far in the U.S. The result of four years of rigorous planning and meticulous execution, \u201cPigeon\u201d could fare slightly better than \u201cSongs From the Second Floor\u201d and \u201cYou, the Living\u201d (both of which bowed at Cannes), but only just.

Here, the Laurel-and-Hardy-esque pair appear in nearly one-third of the film\u2019s 37 fixed-camera compositions, a series of chuckle-inducing tableaux that clock in at just under three minutes apiece on average.\nEach of these shots serves as a nearly self-contained comic vignette, like a cross between a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d cartoon and a Gregory Crewdson photograph, and the best way to approach them is as you might a large-canvas painting or a Jacques Tati film: Study the faces, soak up the details, allow the eye to wander and the mind to free-associate.

The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car. After Carl's Jr. delivered the \"SpielBurgers\" to Amblin, the director announced a cease and desist to the fast food chain after sort of complimenting the taste of their creations. Spielberg had this to say.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders SpielBurgers and they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it - sorry, guys.\"\nThe publicity stunt worked out perfectly for Carl's Jr. They knew that Steven Spielberg would never sign off on the deal, but if they got any response from him, it would be well worth it. Not only did Spielberg respond, he recorded a video that stated that \"SpielBurgers\" were pretty good, resulting in free promotion for the fast food chain and Ready Player One. Obviously, Carl's Jr. is pretty happy with the outcome that they orchestrated. Though the note on the executive's car was a tad bit creepy.\nAs for official partnerships, Ready Player One teamed up with the extremely popular HQ Trivia app for a record breaking prize of $250,000. The trivia game will take place tonight, March 28th at 6:30 PM Pacific and 9:30 PM Eastern, to celebrate the release of the movie. As for Steven Spielberg actually eating Carl's Jr., that has to be a bit of a white lie. One cannot imagine one of the most legendary directors of all time eating that type of fast food, even though our president mows down McDonald's more than once a week. You can check out the brilliant marketing plan to promote fast food and Ready Player One below, courtesy of the Carl's Jr. Twitter account."}

The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family.

What do you think they have taught you?\nDo you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood\u2019s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts \u2014 known as serious games \u2014 once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year\u2019s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game\u2019s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.\nMr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.\n\u2014 What are your favorite video games?

Before we continue, a mildly surprising fact: this record was produced by 19-time Grammy nominee Danger Mouse, whose CV includes The Black Keys, A$AP Rocky, Norah Jones.

{"idx": "496", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nThe defeat follows a hard-fought campaign that broke Oregon's spending record for ballot initiatives and pitted business interests against the state's largest public employee unions.\nMeasure 97 would charge certain C corporations a 2.5 percent tax on their gross annual sales in Oregon above $25 million. The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut"}

Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them.\nThe Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet.\nAfter meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf.\nDelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind.\nMonday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff.\nSpeaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would \"abide by any decision the family makes.\"\n\"After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley,\" Allred said.\nEarlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday.\n\"Our contract is still in full bloom,\" Cynthia Bradley said. \"We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers. Eventually, we hope to see her on every stage around the world.\"\nWhen asked about the contract, Allred said, \"We believe that contract is voidable. We don't believe it's enforceable and we won't be honoring it.\"\nIn dismissing the motions, Smaltz said the case revolved around \"individual rights that emphasize personal success over the family unit or family togetherness.\"\nShe said it was Misty's desire to live with her mother and not pursue emancipation.\nSmaltz added that in a closed-door meeting last week, Misty told her she wanted the parties to sit down privately and resolve their differences over her career.\nBut DelaCerna said Monday that wouldn't be happening.\nReading from a statement, she said, \"I love my daughter immensely and will continue to support her in her dance career,\" adding that Misty will continue taking lessons at a Torrance dance school, away from the Bradleys.\nMisty also recited from a brief statement, saying, \"I"}

Data on spending, on new residents, on schemes to prepare for the Expo, on the utility needs this sudden growth creates and so on.\nFor the IT industry, the surge in the data that companies want to analyse means more demand for software, hardware and services.\nDubai and the wider UAE recovered pretty quickly from the economic downturn. It kept spending on big infrastructure schemes and benefited economically from some of the tragedy happening elsewhere in the Arab world, as people fled conflict to set up home here. So, in big data terms, technology companies were already highlighting the UAE as among the fastest growing in the region.\nExpats, for instance, have to send their children to private schools over here, as state schools are open only to locals. The emirate's Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which oversees education, says there are 153 private schools in Dubai, educating more than 225,000 students across 15 curricula (such as the English, American or Indian national curriculum).\nPrivate schools cater to almost 89 percent of Dubai's population and due to their reputation, around 43 percent of local students also attend private schools.\nSo, as the emirate's companies employ more people, you can guarantee that those who run the private schools are crunching the numbers as they try and estimate how many extra places will be needed over the next seven years, in which curricula they are likely to enrol and seeking trends in educational practices that can be adopted as they accommodate the rising student population. And so it will be for every other industry.\nAnalyst firm IDC recently predicted before the win that investment in business analytics in the Middle East is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 percent over the next five years.

(NYSE: UTX) and its UTC Climate, Controls & Security business. The U.S. is also one of the global leaders in the percentage of firms expecting to construct new green institutional projects and green retrofits of existing buildings.\nThe global study, which received additional support from Saint-Gobain, the U.S. Green Building Council and the Regenerative Network, positions the U.S. as a strong participant in the global green movement. Responses from more than 1,000 building professionals from 60 countries place the U.S. green industry in context. The study also provides specific comparisons with 12 other countries from which a sufficient response was gained to allow for statistical analysis: Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nAccording to the report, U.S. construction should see an increase in the share of green work in the next few years, largely as a result of companies intensifying their involvement in the green building industry. An increasing percentage of respondents projected that more than 60 percent of their projects would be green projects - from 24 percent of respondents in 2015 to 39 percent in 2018. Respondents projecting that fewer than 15 percent of their projects would be certified green plummeted from 41 percent in 2015 to 27 percent by 2018.\nWhile this increased share of green building is impressive, it is significantly less than many developing countries included in the survey. For example, Brazil expects six-fold growth (from 6 percent to 36 percent) in the percentage of companies conducting a majority of their projects green; five-fold growth is expected in China (from 5 percent to 28 percent); and four-fold growth is expected in Saudi Arabia (from 8 percent to 32 percent).\n\"The strong U.S. industry for green building projects is clearly an opportunity for U.S. firms, but so is the rapid rise of green in many of the developing countries,\" said Stephen Jones, Senior Director of Industry Insights, Dodge Data & Analytics. \"Expertise from experienced green designers, builders and manufacturers from the U.S. is likely to be essential to support the aggressive green building expectations revealed by the study respondents.\"\nIn the U.S., the highest percentage of respondents report that they expect to work on new green institutional projects (such as schools, hospitals and public buildings), green retrofits of existing buildings and new green commercial construction (such as office and retail buildings) in the next three years. When compared with global averages, it becomes clear that the U.S. is a leader in new green institutional construction and green retrofits of existing buildings.\n43 percent of U.S. respondents plan to work on green retrofits of existing buildings, again well above the global average of 37 percent.\nThe U.S. is also distinguished from the global findings in terms of the importance it places on reducing energy consumption as an environmental reason for building green. Over three quarters (76 percent) of U.S. respondents consider this important, nearly double the percentage of the next most important environmental factor, which is reducing water consumption. While the other 12 countries in the study prioritize"}

Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case. The final dimensions of the prototype were 2\" x 2\" x 5\"(Height x Width x Length). A series of prototypes were constructed with different design options. Preliminary testing was conducted, and a formal test procedure was written for the customer to ensure all performance requirements were met. The preliminary testing showed that the different concept filter designs maintained an acceptable flow rate through the test system. A significant pressure change was measured but this did not affect the flow rate. Minor deformation in the filter was noted due to the pressure differential but this can be eliminated with an improved fabrication process. The loss coefficient was determined with the information gained from the tests and the value fell into an acceptable range for filters. Analysis of the results showed that a filter with a relief valve would be best to fulfill the design goals. Finally, it is recommended that further testing would be needed to ensure proper operation of the filter under all operating conditions.\nHercinger, Frank; Kidman, Beau; and Van Syckel, Seth, \"Transmission Intake Filtration System\" (2002).

I love this advisory work, not just because it\u2019s the most profitable but also because it is intellectually challenging. Like most of us in tax, I\u2019m a bit of a nerd.\nThere is a lot of nonsense talked about tax. Contrary to popular belief most rich people don\u2019t avoid tax: they pay lots of it.

There are a few people who try to avoid paying any tax if they can, almost as a matter of principle. But they make nightmare clients, and I won\u2019t deal with them.\nObviously a hot topic is where legitimate tax planning ends and unacceptable avoidance starts. My own view is that once you start introducing artificial transactions with no commercial purpose then you\u2019re in danger of crossing the line from planning to avoidance.\nI have never advocated \u201cpackaged\u201d avoidance schemes to my clients, and in fact have actively discouraged people from using them.

It proceeds through the Scripture, the Sacred Tradition, the Church Councils, and the Magisterial teachings of the Church. The Holy father wrote: \"With good reason, then, at the end of this Millennium, we Christians who know that the providential plan of the Most Holy Trinity is the central reality of Revelation and of faith feel the need to emphasize the unique presence of the Mother of Christ in history, especially during these last years leading up to the year 2000.\n\"The Second Vatican Council prepares us for this by presenting in its teaching the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and of the Church. If it is true, as the Council itself proclaims, that 'only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light,' then this principle must be applied in a very particular way to that exceptional \"daughter of the human race,\" that extraordinary \"woman\" who became the Mother of Christ. Only in the mystery of Christ is her mystery fully made clear. Thus has the Church sought to interpret it from the very beginning: the mystery of the Incarnation has enabled her to penetrate and to make ever clearer the mystery of the Mother of the Incarnate Word.\n\"The Council of Ephesus (431 AD) was of decisive importance in clarifying this, for during that Council, to the great joy of Christians, the truth of the divine motherhood of Mary was solemnly confirmed as a truth of the Church's faith.\nMary is the Mother of God (= Theot\u0102\u0142kos), since by the power of the Holy Spirit she conceived in her virginal womb and brought into the world Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is of one being with the Father. \"The Son of God...born of the Virgin Mary...has truly been made one of us,\" has been made man.\n\"Thus, through the mystery of Christ, on the horizon of the Church's faith there shines in its fullness the mystery of his Mother. In turn, the dogma of the divine motherhood of Mary was for the Council of Ephesus and is for the Church like a seal upon the dogma of the Incarnation, in which the Word truly assumes human nature into the unity of his person, without cancelling out that nature.\"\nThe first four ecumenical Councils of the Church confirmed and defined Christian belief about the nature of God and the meaning of the Incarnation, saving life, death, ascension and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Council pronouncements concerning Mary were made in reference to defending the truths about Jesus Christ and God's plan of salvation for the entire human race. That plan included, and still includes, the Mother of God.\nThe Catechism, in keeping with the unbroken tradition of the Church, makes the inseparable connection or link between the humanity of Jesus and the humanity of his Mother, as did Blessed John Paul in his encyclical letter cited above. The first four Councils of the Church, which are almost universally accepted among the broader Christian community even beyond the full communion of the Catholic Church, did the same.

The only thing that will make me happy is a movie right now!\"\nI've been attending a parenting class based upon Positive Discipline. The premise is that discipline doesn't need to be punishment, and that acting positive doesn't mean giving permission to do everything. It involves lots of \"strategies\" and \"solutions\" to problems. The adult retains authority, but not because of an assertion of power and control but because of firm but loving guidance for the child. I completely agree with this approach from a theoretical and spiritual perspective. I understand God as a Father who gives us \"rules\" out of love and care for us, not out of a desire to dominate our lives, a Father who is \"for\" us and wants our best. I see myself as a parent who wants to provide a lot of structure for our children, which includes rules and expectations, coupled with a lot of love.\nSo Positive Discipline seems right up my alley. And in the classroom of adults-pretending-to-be-children, it works really well. This past Monday, we solved the problem of one kid terrorizing a cat and another (mine) drawing with milk all over the table.\nIt hasn't worked out quite as well in our home. Last week (on Monday, three hours after class, as it happens) William and I played a Busytown game. At the end of the game, I was feeling very proud of myself for sharing \"special time\" with my son and crawling around on the floor searching for ladders and clocks and all the other objects on the game's board.\nWilliam was not feeling that same pride. He started throwing the pieces all over the room. I put on my Positive Discipline hat and considered the logical consequences of his actions. I told him if he treated the game like garbage, I would put it in the garbage. I gave him the chance to go to his room to calm down, and then decide. Ten minutes later, he looked me straight in the eye (with his pacifier, giraffe, and blanket, just in case I'm tempted to forget that he's four when we fight with each other and he wins, which is what seems to happen most days), and said, \"Throw it away.\"\nI made a big fuss of putting the whole game in a garbage bag and taking it to the trash bins outside. I then realized that a) I had cleaned up the entire game while William lounged in his bed and b) I was about to throw away a perfectly good game.

Southern California has always been an arid land, with cycles of drought, interspersed with wet years every now and again.\nIn December of 1915, San Diego\u2019s city fathers tackled the issue from a completely different angle. They hired a rainmaker!\nThe impetus for their decision was the unfilled Morena Reservoir in the mountains sixty miles east of San Diego. A rock-filled dam had been completed in 1912, but the reservoir had yet to be filled beyond a third of its capacity. Other reservoirs in the area shared the same problem. None were filled and the city was growing.\nThe Council voted 4 to 1 in favor of Hatfield, though a formal agreement was never drawn up.\nOn January 1, 1916, Charles and his brother, Joel, set up a tower beside Morena Reservoir and began work which they labeled as \u201cmoisture enhancement.\u201d Using secret formulas that Charles never disclosed, he mixed and released various chemicals into the air. Four days later, he reported rain at Morena.\nOn January 10th rain fell heavily for twenty-four hours, ceased for a couple of days, then fell in torrents from January 14th to 18th. The San Diego River overflowed, flooding Old Town and Mission Valley. Roads, railroads and bridges were swept away. From Balboa Park, water streamed down the hill into downtown streets. At one point, four feet of water rushed down Broadway.\nBy January 27th the deluge reached epic proportions. In the South Bay area, the water level in the Sweetwater reservoir rose until it overflowed the dam, tearing out a fifty-foot chunk on one end. The Bonita valley became a swirling mass of muddy water taking out farms, houses, roads, railroads and telegraph lines.\nThe Sweetwater Dam had been a tourist attraction. First built in 1888, it was raised and retrofitted a few times, until by 1915, it was the highest dam in the United States. A rail line brought sightseers to this concrete engineering wonder.\nA little farther South, the water level in Otay Reservoir crept closer and closer to the top of the dam. Construction on the Otay Reservoir dam had begun in 1888 spearheaded by Elisha S. Babcock who built the Hotel del Coronado. As early as 1897, James D. Schuyler, the engineer who had designed the Sweetwater Dam, warned that the rock-filled Lower Otay Dam might not survive a severe storm. His prophecy came true.\nNo one knows for sure how many lives were lost in the Flood of 1916. Some say twenty; others, sixty. Many of the victims were Japanese farmers who lived in the valleys. In the days following the disaster, several Japanese people could be seen in boats searching the South Bay for lost loved ones. A monument to the Japanese victims of the flood can be seen in Mount Hope Cemetery.\nThe entire San Diego area was isolated from the world, highways and railroads washed away, telephone lines destroyed.

Yet only 10 were reported to the college, which regulates Ontario nurses, when Wettlaufer was fired in March 2014 from the Caressant Care home in Woodstock.\nBy then, Wettlaufer had already killed seven residents in her care and assaulted two others with overdoses of insulin. By the time she confessed, unprompted, to police in September 2016, Wettlaufer had killed eight people and assaulted or tried to kill six others. She continued to work, with an unblemished public record on the College of Nurses website, until she turned herself in.\nSandler suggested the college didn\u2019t investigate Wettlaufer in 2014 because the termination report to the regulatory body didn\u2019t provide a full picture of Wettlaufer\u2019s history. \u201cIt could leave a misleading impression\u201d if a nurse\u2019s full disciplinary history and medication errors isn\u2019t reported to the college, Sandler said.\nHelen Crombez, former director of nursing at Caressant, replied that administrators at the nursing home believed the 10 items noted in the termination report to the college would have been enough to spark an investigation on whether Wettlaufer was fit to continue practising. The termination report included three suspensions Wettlaufer received \u2014 for a total of 11 days \u2014 due to medication errors.\nWhen a college official called Crombez in July 2014 to ask about Wettlaufer\u2019s termination, Crombez described Wettlaufer as \u201cvery pleasant with residents,\u201d and added that her medication errors didn\u2019t cause \u201csustained harm to the residents,\u201d according to notes of the conversation presented as evidence. The only negative comments noted about Wettlaufer were that staff \u201calways complained\u201d about her, and she refused to change the way she did her job.\n\u201cYou certainly weren\u2019t communicating to the college that she was unfit, incompetent, (or) incapable,\u201d Sandler told Crombez, who was director of nursing at Caressant for more than 30 years.\nThe inquiry, headed by Commissioner Eileen Gillese, is examining how Wettlaufer could have left a trail of death and incompetence as a registered nurse for nine years without anyone stopping her before she finally turned herself in. Final recommendations are expected by July 2019.\nCrombez said she felt \u201cblessed\u201d when Wettlaufer applied for a job at Caressant in 2007.\nCrombez said she had no idea that Wettlaufer had been fired in 1995 while working at the Geraldton District Hospital, after she was found stumbling, slurring her speech and vomiting. She had taken large amounts of the anti-anxiety drug Ativan. Her union, the Ontario Nurses\u2019 Association, grieved the firing and her employment record was amended to state that Wettlaufer had resigned of her own accord.

CNET will also let you know how things are going at the AT&T stores where only customers who preordered phones will be able to pick them up. Anyone looking to buy an iPhone off-the-shelf from AT&T will have to wait until Tuesday.\nAT&T says that demand for the iPhone 4 is 10 times what it was for last year's iPhone 3GS. And Apple says it took 600,000 preorders for the new phone through its sales channels.\nIf history is any indication of what to expect, initial sales of the iPhone 4 are likely to be big.

The original iPhone sold about 270,000 units during its first weekend in June 2007, while the iPhone 3G sold around 1 million when it launched in July 2008.\nWhile there's little doubt that the lines will long, the big question is whether AT&T's activation system will be able to hold up under the pressure. If the preorder process is any indication of what to expect, iPhone fans may need to be patient. On June 15, thousands of customers trying to preorder the iPhone were met with error messages on AT&T's and Apple's Web sites.

{"idx": "530", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Does a Pyrethrin-Based Spray Kill Gnats?\nPyrethrins rapidly decompose after exposure to light and air.\nFungus gnats are tiny insects that can quickly become a huge nuisance in outdoor areas during stretches of cool, wet weather. Harmless to people, pets and landscaping plants, adult gnat populations quickly get out of control because each female can lay up to 300 eggs, with each egg hatching in about three days. Pyrethrin-based insecticidal sprays can help you control extreme gnat infestations, but you must start treatment as soon as you notice the pests.\nPyrethrins are natural, botanical pesticides derived from the flowers of certain chrysanthemums. The blooms are harvested and typically dried or ground into powder. Adult fungus gnats are highly susceptible to pyrethrins, which work as a contact poison that rapidly penetrates the insect's nervous system so it can't fly or move around. Although gnats drop almost immediately after you spray them, they don't always die. Gnats, like other insects, possess an enzyme that quickly detoxifies the pyrethrins, which allows some gnats to recover after initially being knocked down. Because of this, many pyrethrin-based products also contain a petroleum-derived synergist or carbamate to slow down that enzyme's action. Many pyrethrin products come in ready-to-spray formulations that make outdoor treatment easy.\nPyrethrin-based sprays quickly reduce fungus gnat populations, but control is typically temporary. New adult gnats emerge every day, so be prepared to spray affected plants about every three days for at least 14 days to get rid of the pests. After reading the instructions on the product's label, attach a container of ready-to-spray, pyrethrin-based insecticide to a garden hose. Once you turn on the water, it automatically mixes with the chemicals to form the correct application dosage. Hold the container 18 to 24 inches away from the target plant and thoroughly spray the tops and undersides of the leaves. Spray the surface of the soil around gnat-infested plants as well. Allow the solution to completely dry before reentering the treated area. For optimal control results, use a pyrethrin spray only when rain isn't predicted for your area for at least 24 hours.\nPyrethrin can cause itching, irritation or a burning sensation if it makes contact with skin, so reduce your risk of exposure by wearing protective clothing, including long sleeves, pants, socks and shoes, a face mask, goggles and rubber or latex gloves. Start spraying for gnats at the farthest corner of your target treatment area and work your way backward to avoid walking through sprayed areas. Spray pyrethrin products when the air is calm to avoid drift. Pyrethrin is highly toxic to honey bees, so spray plants just before sunup or at twilight to avoid harming the pollinating insects.\nMature fungus gnats range in size from 1/15 to 1/2 inch long and have clear to pale gray wings. Although nuisances, they consume only liquids such as flower nectar and water. Fungus gnats are pretty weak fliers that prefer sticking close to their host plants. The legless larvae have clear to white bodies and black heads. They prefer feeding on fungi, algae and other decay"}

The same has held for subsequent features such as the ability to draw and write text on top of shared pictures, the ability to create \"Stories\" whose content vanishes after 24 hours and the ability to add face-altering \"lenses\" to photos and videos.\nIn spite of the frequent derision, Snapchat has grown to have more than 150 million users (more than Twitter (TWTR - Get Report) ), a large portion of whom are in their 20s and 30s rather than just teens. It's also now avidly used as a promotional platform by many celebrities and media firms, and its parent is reportedly aiming for at least $300 million in 2016 revenue.\nBy creating a platform where shared content by and large isn't saved, and where users don't have to worry about likes and comments, Snap has carved out a unique social media and messaging niche and become a thorn in Facebook's (FB - Get Report) side, particularly among younger consumers.\nIf it's able to reach lower price points, win over third-party hardware makers and sidestep the privacy and image concerns that have plagued Alphabet's (GOOGL - Get Report) Google Glass, Spectacles could provide another means of expanding Snap's reach.\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Trump ultimately forced Sessions from office.\nBarr, 68, is expected to be confirmed, unless there is a major surprise during the hearing.

Where was his counterpart getting his political intelligence from? After all, it wasn\u2019t a secret that when it came to the conflict between India and Pakistan, Turkey tended to identify and cooperate with the South Asian Muslim country.\nNo to mention the fact that notwithstanding the partnership between Ankara and Jerusalem, the Turks never considered Israel to be an \u201cally,\u201d as they attempted balancing their relationship with the Jewish State and the Arab countries. In fact, Israel and Turkey didn\u2019t establish full diplomatic until 1992 following the Oslo Process that led to the rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nAnd in any case, the idea of Turkey siding with India and challenging the balance of power in South Asia didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, particularly at a moment when the United States as part of its campaign against terrorism was strengthening its ties with Islamabad and elevating them to the status of a strategic alliance.\nBut then it seemed that Pentagon official was engaged in one of the intellectual exercises favored by both neoconservatives on the political right and liberal internationalists on the political left: Drawing up foreign policy narratives that reflect the dualistic cosmology of Manichaeism in which international relations is seen as a never-ending struggle between light and darkness, between the forces of good led by the United States that are confronting the bad guys, ranging from \u201crogue states\u201d to \u201cauthoritarian regimes\u201d that threaten to destroy the liberal international order.\nBut in the real world, as opposed to the imaginary universe that neoconservatives and Wilsonians dream about, there are very few really good protagonists or really bad antagonists.\nSo you need to make sure that while constructing a narrative one takes into account the \u201canomalies\u201d and resolve the cognitive dissonance between the plot of the fairy tale and the many shades of gray that typify the relations between nations.\nHence, when the Bush Administration responded to the attacks on New York and Washington by Al Qaeda, the radical Muslim fundamentalist group, by launching the war against terrorism it identified Iraq and Iran as two of the leading members of the Axis of Evil it was planning to confront.\nBut that proposed narrative was full with inconsistencies. The secular Ba\u2019ath regime in Baghdad and the Shiite clerics in Tehran regarded Osama Bin Ladin\u2019s terrorist group as well as its ally, the Taliban, the Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement ruling Afghanistan as ideological adversaries (in the case of the secular and semi-fascist Saddam Hussein) or as sectarian foes (in the case of Iran\u2019s Ayatollahs).\nOn the other hand, two of Washington\u2019s allies in the war on terrorism, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, were the two main allies of the Taliban while Al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were proponents of the extremist Wahhabi Muslim dogma promoted by the Saudis and embraced by the Pakistanis.\nThe ne"}

Earlier this month, Revolve announced a round of layoffs in the photo department of its Cerritos headquarters, and sources who spoke to Jezebel believe the company\u2019s seemingly endless budget for mega influencer events\u2014including a Kim Kardashian appearance in the Hamptons\u2014may be coming at the expense of those jobs.\nTwo Revolve employees (both spoke to me over the phone under the condition of anonymity to avoid penalty) said Revolve co-founder Mike Karanikolas held a meeting on June 17 and announced that the company was laying off the majority of its photo editing team\u2014which is responsible for acquiring and editing photos and editorials that appear on the site\u2014to save on operational costs.\nOne staff member also said people who lost their jobs were offered severance packages that will only be issued if they remain at Revolve until their official termination date, which is months down the line. Some employees will stay on until September, while others will remain until November or January, after which their jobs will be outsourced to workers in another country (two employees, one current and one former, specifically said the Philippines). Employees appear to be cautious about publicly discussing the layoffs to avoid jeopardizing their future severance.\nIn June, we notified a small number of employees that they will likely be let go between the months of September and January, as we shift certain work to a 3rd party provider. All affected employees were provided at least several months advance notice, and all were additionally provided severance packages including salary and health coverage, as well as assistance locating other career opportunities. While fewer than ten employees were affected by the changes, we sympathize with their situation, and are doing our best to assist them going forward.\nWe don\u2019t anticipate any other operational changes of this nature and the company will continue to hire and build the team as the business continues to grow.\nExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE, which employs hundreds of individuals. We generally do not comment on marketing expenditures, but we will say in this case the information reported by the press was inaccurate.\nThe inaccuracy she\u2019s referring to are reports that Kim Kardashian was paid $700,000 to host a Revolve Hamptons event this summer. According to the laid-off employees I spoke to, it\u2019s the optics of excess spending that make the layoffs feel more offensive. Perhaps what\u2019s happening is an overlap of their personal disappointment about losing a job and the natural effects of a company that\u2019s prioritizing public image.\nStill, like other fashion outlets, Revolve relies heavily on celebrities and influencers for a marketing boost. Nicole Richie collaborated on a line, stars like Kendall and Kylie Jenner have sold a collection on their site, and style bloggers are frequently sent on trips to promote the brand. Such events have become the lifeblood of Revolve.\nIn addition to taking care of their travel and accommodations, Revolve gifted each influencer with a sizable clothing credit \u2014 a source close to the participating talent tells us $2,000 is standard \u2014 in addition to paying his or her appearance fee. And for certain agency-backed bloggers, like Bernstein and Bazan, who are both represented by Next Models, this can easily run in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe"}

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to a congressman in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.\nEffectively ruling out U.S. cruise missile attacks and other options that wouldn't require U.S. troops on the ground, Dempsey said the military is clearly capable of taking out Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force and shifting the balance of the Arab country's 2 1/2-year war back toward the armed opposition. But he said such an approach would plunge the United States deep into another war in the Arab world and offer no strategy for peace in a nation plagued by ethnic rivalries.\n\"Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,\" Dempsey said in the letter Aug. 19 to Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.\"\nDempsey's pessimistic assessment will hardly please members of the fractured Syrian opposition leadership and some members of the administration who have championed greater support to help the rebellion end Assad's four-decade family dynasty. Despite almost incessant bickering and internal disputes, some opposition groups have worked with the United States and other European and Arab supporters to try to form a cohesive, inclusive movement dedicated to a democratic and multiethnic state.\nBut those fighting the Assad government range wildly in political and ethnic beliefs and not all are interested in Western support.\nAs the conflict has gone on, killing more than 100,000 people and ripping apart the delicate sectarian fabric of Syrian society, al-Qaida-linked rebels and other extremist groups have been responsible for some of the same types of massacres and ethnic attacks that the Assad regime has committed. On Tuesday, Kurdish militias battled against al-Qaida-linked fighters in the northeast in fighting that has fueled a mass exodus of refugees into Iraq and risks exploding into a full-blown side conflict.\nDempsey said Syria's war was \"tragic and complex.\"\n\"It is a deeply rooted, long-term conflict among multiple factions, and violent struggles for power will continue after Assad's rule ends,\" he wrote. \"We should evaluate the effectiveness of limited military options in this context.\"\nOn Wednesday, two Syrian pro-opposition groups claimed that government forces carried out a \"poisonous gas\" attack near the capital, Damascus, leaving dozens of people dead. There was no government comment on the claims and the reports could not be independently confirmed.\nDespite calling for Assad to leave power in 2011, President Barack Obama has steadfastly refused to allow the U.S. to be drawn directly into the conflict. Officials have said for the past couple of months, however, that the U.S. is prepared to provide lethal aid to vetted, moderate units among the opposition ranks.

The four schools include Roxbury Community College, Bay Path University in Longmeadow, Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley and the Urban College of Boston.\nThe new recipients are part of a more than $1.4 million grant pool to 82 schools across the country. Delivered in partnership with the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative, the grants build upon the three organizations' combined commitment to helping deliver a tobacco-free generation.\nThe funding announced today will help accelerate and expand the number of campuses across the country that prohibit smoking, e-cigarette, and other tobacco product use. While conventional cigarette smoking among high school students has fallen by almost 50 percent since 2011, e-cigarette use has surged over the last year, especially among young people\u2014there are 2.8 million young adults aged 18-24 who are current e-cigarette users. The spread of e-cigarettes risks a reversal of the progress made in reducing smoking over the last two decades given that young people who vape are four times more likely to begin smoking cigarettes in the future.\n\"A critical goal in building healthier communities across the country is reducing tobacco-use, which remains one of the leading causes of preventable death in this country,\" said Eileen Howard Boone, President of the CVS Health Foundation. \"By helping more colleges and universities explore and execute on tobacco-free policies, we're able to positively influence the number of new college-age smokers and get one step closer to our goal of seeing the first tobacco-free generation.\"\nThe grants are part of Be The First, CVS Health's five-year, $50 million initiative to deliver the nation's first tobacco-free generation, which is a major program within the company's new $100 million Building Healthier Communities initiative. While the number of U.S. colleges and universities that are smoke- or tobacco-free has doubled since 2012, approximately half of the nearly 5,000 schools across the country still have no comprehensive policy in place.\nWith the CVS Health Foundation's support, the American Cancer Society and Truth Initiative programs help students, faculty and staff develop and execute strategies that are customized to meet the unique needs of each campus and move the schools toward a 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free environment. Together, the organizations have provided financial and technical support to more than 200 colleges and universities since 2016, helping to clear the air for more than one million students.\n\"While the teen smoking rate has fallen to an all-time low of 4.6 percent, the rapid rise in e-cigarette use threatens to erase this progress given youth who vape are four times more likely to progress to smoking deadly cigarettes,\" said Robin Koval, CEO and President of Truth Initiative. \"Over the years, we've had great success in working with colleges to go smoke- and tobacco-free.

We have. Today\u2019s column explains the differences among Subaru\u2019s three crossover offerings.\nWhy Subaru? Because it\u2019s the ultimate New England fallback for the region\u2019s winter climate.\nMost folks reading this know a bit about Subarus; namely, that they: 1) are a popular vehicle in New England; 2) last a long time; 3) have a time-tested all-wheel-drive system; 4) and all look somewhat alike.\nBut ask those same folks to describe the differences among the Outback, Forester, and XV CrossTtrek, and you\u2019re liable to get a blank stare.\nMo\u00acst of us recognize the models, but are hard-pressed to single out what\u2019s distinctive about each one.\nThe differences are real. The Outback is longer, the Forester is higher and has a higher cargo area, especially important if you\u2019ve got a good-sized dog, and the XV CrossTrek definitely has an edgy, more aggressive look, in large part because of its fancy wheels. It\u2019s also the only one that comes in tangerine orange, a color that definitely goes outside the Subaru mainstream.\nHere\u2019s a capsule look at each vehicle, replete with random tangential thoughts. We\u2019re comparing the three, each in mid-range premium trim with the CVT transmission.\nFrankly, because it looks like a second cousin to a Volvo SUV, we thought the Outback was the smallest member of the family. Actually, it happens to be the longest, fitting into the midsize crossover category. It\u2019s got a longer wheelbase (by 4-plus inches) than the other two and is significantly longer overall (189.6 inches compared to 180.9 for the Forester and 175.2 for the XV Crosstrek). It\u2019s also wider than the others (72.4 inches compared to 70.7 for the Forester and 70.1 for the XV Crosstrek).\nThe Outback also happens to be Subaru\u2019s No. 1 seller.

That's nearly three times as fast as the number two state, Texas, and trounces the national average of 2.5%.\nThis is the third year in a row that North Dakota took the top spot in BEA's state-by-state report on gross domestic product (GDP). The muscle behind the boom is a surge in oil production from the Bakken Shale, an underground rock formation in the northwestern part of the state.\nThanks to high oil prices and new drilling technology -- including the controversial hydraulic fracturing, better known as \"fracking\" -- oil production in North Dakota is now six times higher than it was in 2007. In 2012, North Dakota surpassed Alaska and California to become the second largest oil-producing state in the nation behind Texas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nThe boom has attracted workers from all over the country and rippled out to incorporate not only the oil and gas drilling sectors but also other industries that supply them, including wholesale goods and transportation.\n\"There's nothing like an oil boom to get things rolling,\" North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple told CNNMoney.\nUnlike some other states, North Dakota has a tax specifically targeting oil and gas production. That tax has allowed the state government to cover 80% of the cost of public schools, greatly reducing property taxes on the local level, Dalrymple said. It also allowed for a reduction in state income taxes, and covered the cost of building roads and other infrastructure to accommodate the influx of workers.\nThere are still downsides to the rapid growth. Housing prices in parts of the state are as high as Manhattan, and some areas are having problems obtaining enough water. But the state's unemployment rate is below 3%, and North Dakota is \"hanging on to our college graduates like we never have before,\" Dalrymple said.\nOil and gas is the biggest economic driver, but Dalrymple said his state is also doing a good job attracting other industries. Deere & Co. (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) are building factories in the state, and an Amazon (AMZN) service center is also in the works.\nThe second fastest-growing state was Texas, which benefited from oil and gas activity in its own shale formations as well as a strong showing in its manufacturing sector.\nIn fact, the manufacturing of durable goods -- things that last longer than three years, such as cars, appliances or software -- grew by more than 9% nationwide in 2012, according the BEA. It was the leading contributor to growth in 22 states, the bureau said.\nIn Oregon -- the third fastest-growing state -- manufacturing contributed almost 3 percentage points to the state's GDP.\nComputers and electronics dominate Oregon's manufacturing industry, with Intel (INTC) in particular leading the way, said Josh Lehner, a state economist. The company has been expanding its chip manufacturing plants, as well as its research and development unit in the state.\nWashington and Minnesota rounded out the five fastest-growing states.

The ship's catapult has yet to launch an actual aircraft at sea and the vessel has only had helicopters land on its deck.\nAlthough it has yet to be put to the test, some already say the USS Gerald R. Ford is an example of the Navy's costly and risky bet on \"immature\" technology.\nExperts say the Navy's decision to roll out some untested technologies in its next-generation classes of ships has been a costly lesson. For example, the new Ford aircraft carrier going into the Navy fleet cost nearly $13 billion, or around $2.4 billion above plan.\nThe Navy \"made a significant bet on the newest and latest cutting-edge technology, and it bet that all of those technologies would mature as these platforms were scheduled to come online,\" said Jerry Hendrix, senior fellow and director of the Defense Strategies and Assessments Program at the Center for a New American Security, a non-partisan Washington think tank.\nHendrix added, \"Unfortunately some of those technologies did not mature. Hence, we're seeing some delays in some critical programs, including the new Ford-Class carrier.\"\nAlthough years behind schedule, the Ford carrier was formally commissioned into the Navy's fleet Saturday in a ceremony in Virginia, which was attended by President Donald Trump. The president had previously visited the carrier in March.\nIn remarks Saturday, Trump called the Ford carrier \"the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of this world.\"\nWhen building the new Ford carrier, the Navy ditched the steam-powered catapult system found on the older Nimitz-Class carriers and went instead with a electro-magnetic aircraft launch system. Similarly, the Navy went with an updated arresting gear to catch planes landing on the ship's deck.\nThe Ford is the first new design of an aircraft carrier in 40 years. Last month, acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley conceded costs of the carriers were tough to swallow, but insisted the service (and shipbuilding industry) planned to learn from past missteps. Meanwhile, the maker of the new digital catapult, General Atomics, claims on its webpage the system's benefits include a \"reduced manning and life-cycle cost.\"\nThe technology replaced the battle-tested steam catapult that had been used for decades to launch planes.

But when our interests and values are at stake, we have a responsibility to act. That is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks.\"\nBut he also underscored the limits of US military action as he sought to counter criticism that he lacked clear objectives and a credible exit strategy in the conflict.\n\"I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi's deadly advance,\" Obama told military officers at the National Defense University in Washington, 10 days after ordering US participation in Western-led air strikes.\n\"We will deny the regime arms, cut off its supply of cash, assist the opposition, and work with other nations to hasten the day when Gaddafi leaves power,\" Obama said.\nBut he added that \"it may not happen overnight\" and acknowledged that Gaddafi may be able to cling to power. \"Broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake,\" he said.\nObama spoke on the eve of a 35-nation conference in London to tackle the crisis in the North African oil-exporting country and weigh political options for ending Gaddafi's 41-year rule.\nObama's challenge was to define the limited purpose and scope of the US mission in Libya for Americans preoccupied with domestic economic concerns and weary of costly wars in two other Muslim countries, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBut his words may not be enough to mollify Republican opponents who say he has failed to lead in recent global crises ranging from Middle East unrest to Japan's nuclear emergency.\nObama's prime-time speech came a day after NATO agreed to assume full responsibility for military operations in Libya, ending uncertainty about who would take over the lead from US forces. \"The US will play a supporting role for the coalition,\" he stated.\nHe said the handover would take place on Wednesday.\nThe alliance's decision gave a boost to Obama's effort to show Americans he was making good on his commitment to limit the US military's involvement in Libya. NATO will take charge of air strikes that have targeted Gaddafi's military infrastructure as well as a no-fly zone and an arms embargo.\nThe White House also hopes Obama can score political points at home from gains on the battlefield by Libyan rebels emboldened by the Western air assault on Gaddafi's loyalists."}

{"idx": "570", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Every Single Ocean Has A Massive Swirling Plastic Garbage Vortex Now!\nFor most of the world, the disposal of our trash is of high importance. We don\u2019t want to have huge stinking trash heaps of coagulated waste stinking to high heaven near our homes, work, or places of entertainment. That is why we are trying to limit pollution across the map such as reducing carbon omissions, reusing items as life hacks, and recycling whenever we can.\nDespite our good intentions, we are not perfect beings and there will be times when the easiest option for waste is just to throw it away. Also, the world doesn\u2019t seem to share our sympathetic views of keeping our planet clean, especially when it comes to plastic. In fact, most of our trash is thrown away into one place: the ocean. As a result, every ocean now has a giant swirling vortex of plastic garbage.\nAccording to an article by Vox, a single conservative estimate suggests that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean since the 1970s. Taking our knowledge of underwater currents, scientists were able to find the swirling vortexes of plastic. Each vortex is also calculated to have thousands of tons of plastic in the underwater current cyclone. Here is the kicker: We reported that at least 1 million tons of plastic has entered the ocean, so where did the rest go? The vortexes only account for less than 1 percent of the plastic in estimation. Therefore, nobody really knows where the other 99 percent went. One weird possibility is that the fish are eating the plastic and it is entering the food chain.\nNevertheless, the garbage in our waters has increased in such high amounts that we now have something known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is a patch of trash the size of Texas that\u2019s accumulated in a swirling subtropical underwater whirlpool. It is also the most frequently studied and the most commonly known.\nNow reports are coming in from the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences that there are five of these swirling vortexes in the ocean. These findings are the work of Andres C\u00f3zar of the Universidad de Cadiz, along with information from the results of a 2010 circumnavigation cruise. To the human eye, or even from space, these garbage patches are invisible. Most of the plastic is bobbing just beneath the surface and most of the particles are smaller than one centimeter in diameter. Over time, plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, which is plausible in an ocean with currents, waves, and degradation from the sun.\nRight now, the scientists behind the findings are figuring out where the 99 percent of mixing plastic is. They have ideas, such as washing back on shore, or plastic being broken down even smaller than a centimeter in diameter, but right now, it is all theory."}

The school not only helps children prepare for the Sacraments, but also assists the Polish chaplain in arranging Mass for the children, which includes a children\u2019s choir. The group also prepares the Sunday issue of the parish newsletter.\nThe Polish School received support at its beginning from Fr Keith Herrera, who allowed the church to be used for classes.

The meeting is the first public convening of the nation\u2019s top civil rights leaders since a spate of police violence sparked unrest in cities across the nation, starting with the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., last August.\nSharpton said that he plans personally to petition Senate Republicans to hold a floor vote on Lynch\u2019s nomination. He also plans trips to three states where religious objections laws have either been passed or are being considered.\nOnce a skeptic of the gay rights movement, Sharpton has in recent years emerged as one of its most vocal black supporters. These days, he argues that gay rights should be considered a civil rights matter. He said bringing gay and lesbian groups into the civil rights fold is crucial to bolstering the political power of those working on civil justice issues.\nSuch issues \u2014 gay rights and reforms in policing, criminal justice and prisons \u2014 have dominated the national discussion in recent months, opening the door for civil rights groups to claim a higher profile during the presidential campaign, some civil rights leaders say.\nThis week\u2019s conference will help advance that cause, they say, and help focus efforts to define the issues to be highlighted in 2016.\nCampbell is one of several leaders of civil rights organizations \u2014 including the heads of the NAACP and the Urban League \u2014 who plan to participate in a panel intended to chart a course, and to funnel energy from national protests in favor of policing and criminal justice reforms toward political action and achieving tangible results.\n\u201cWe need to be working collaboratively around how we apply elevated pressure on the candidates to talk about these issues,\u201d Campbell said.\nSharpton has been a persistent and insistent voice on behalf of reforms in policing and the criminal justice system, and this week\u2019s convention marks the latest shift in the evolution of his tactics. Although he is a lightning rod despised by many police groups, especially the New York Police Department, Sharpton is vowing to take a more considerate line.\nAt this week\u2019s convention, at least three potential 2016 presidential candidates, all dark horses, will speak: Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.); former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley (D); and Maryland\u2019s Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and so far the only black person known to be considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination.\nA decade ago, it would not have been surprising for Sharpton himself to consider a presidential run.

In southeastern Georgia, the Atlantic Ocean attracts throngs of beach-goers each summer. The low-lying southern parts of the state are fringed with swamps, including the massive Okefenokee. The terrain gently rises to the north and west, and the state\u2019s principal city, Atlanta, sits just to the south of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains. These mountains rise to over 4,000 feet, drawing hikers, climbers and other outdoor enthusiasts. Georgia\u2019s relatively significant size and diverse topography mean that the climate varies in different parts of the state.\nGeorgia falls into the same climate classification category, humid subtropical, as most of the southeastern United States. This climate type features mild winters, comfortable spring and autumn temperatures, but long, hot and steamy summers. As its name implies, high humidity characterizes the humid subtropical climate type, which makes temperatures feel even warmer. Precipitation amounts vary annually but tend to be substantial, ranging from an average of 50 inches in the southern lowlands to 75 inches in the mountains. The northern mountains, particularly the higher elevations, experience the coldest average temperatures in the state, while the far south has the overall highest temperatures.\nMost of Georgia becomes sweltering in the summertime, as tropical air streams into the state unabated. The high temperature in the hottest months of the year, July and August, average in the low 90s Fahrenheit in the south and coastal areas, the upper 80s to near 90 in the Atlanta vicinity and the mid to upper 80s in the mountains. Overnight lows average in the low 70s in the south and on the coast, near 70 in Atlanta, and the 60s in the mountains. Occasional thunderstorms provide the bulk of summer rainfall, except for precipitation from tropical storms and hurricanes in late summer. Such systems occasionally directly strike Georgia\u2019s Atlantic coast, but more often their remnants track into the state from Alabama, Florida and South Carolina.\nWinters are mild throughout the state, although temperatures exhibit considerable geographic variation. In January and February, daily highs in the south and along the southeast coast average in the low to mid-60s, highs around Atlanta average in the mid-50s, and highs in the mountains top out only around 50. Overnight lows hover near 40 in the south and on the coast, the low to mid-30s around Atlanta and the upper 20s in the mountains. Flurries and light snow usually fall in northern Georgia a few times per year, but the chance of seeing snow decreases further south. Measurable snowfall or ice accumulations are rare but are far more likely in the mountains than elsewhere in the state.\nMarch and April feature pleasant temperatures, with highs in the 70s and 80s to the south and 60s and 70s to the north, it is a great time to see the new flowers. Temperatures begin to creep up in May, with highs averaging in the low 80s throughout much of the state. Severe thunderstorms can occur in spring, occasionally producing hail and sometimes even spawning tornadoes.

He was not alone in this. I remember when Gerald Ford, before he succeeded Spiro Agnew as Nixon's vice president, said (regarding some of the spirited criticism of the Nixon Vietnam policy): \"You don't go out and tackle your quarterback once he has called the play.\" I thought at the time that if your quarterback appeared demented and was running in the wrong direction, tackling him mightn't be a bad idea.\nI think a great many American men find football talk irresistible as a demonstration of two-fisted he-manship, and I suspect that that is one reason Vice President George Bush, a couple of days after his first debate with Michael Dukakis, gave a speech in which he used a plethora of football images. He had the Democrats \"punting on first down,\" and he said that the Republican team now had the ball and was going to march, march on down the field, and I thought that at any minute he might break into a chorus of \"Boola-Boola\" and \"Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow! Wow! Wow!\" As a way of shaking off a wimp image, football lingo probably seems very tempting.\nI feel uneasy when powerful public figures shift into the gridiron mode in discussing the life-and-death affairs that affect all of us on this precious, precarious planet. There are just enough similarities between football and war to lure us into confusing the two. Football even has The Bomb.\nFor those who are too inactive or, like millions of wives, too intellectual to watch football on the tube, where we athletes learn the language, The Bomb is a long forward pass. Our pass receiver scampers through the defensive backfield and makes a dash for the enemy goal line. Our quarterback unleashes The Bomb, a forward pass of perhaps 65 yards that lands on the sticky fingers of the receiver. Our receiver then carries The Bomb jubilantly into the end zone for a touchdown. As bombs go, it's not bad. The only explosion it causes is the roar of the fans, and it's quite harmless to the public.\nIn another section of Cooke's work, he attempts to enlighten his countrymen on the mysteries of American football. He says, \". . . No American institution is worse understood abroad than American football. British sportsmen . . . succumb without a second thought to the facetious view of American football as a mindless bout of mayhem between brutes got up in spacemen outfits. . . . American football is an open-air chess game disguised as warfare. It is without question the most scientific of all outdoor games.\"\nThis, of course, was written years before our football teams went over to capture the hearts and minds of the British.\nI hope that, whoever our next President may be, he will stay away from the football metaphor.

Another highlight is the 106-acre Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, located just north of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the summer, most of the parks in New York host free concerts on different nights, many of which feature well-known acts.

Here\u2019s how to navigate the dreaded bill in any scenario.\nWhen you\u2019re going out with family, whoever does the inviting typically foots the bill. So if Dad, Mom, an aunt, uncle or cousin does the asking, expect them to pay \u2014 but it\u2019s always worth offering to kick in a few bucks, especially if you can afford to, etiquette experts note.\nIf you\u2019re out with siblings, don\u2019t expect the person who makes the most to foot the bill every time. It\u2019s okay to let a sis or bro pick up the check now and then, Thomas said, but be prepared to reciprocate the gesture, or simply split the tab each time to avoid an argument.\nAlways expect to go Dutch when grabbing drinks or dinner with friends, Thomas said.\nIt\u2019s always easiest to split the bill among everyone who joins instead of splitting hairs over the cost of separate menu items, especially if it\u2019s a big group, Thomas added. Another way to avoid the hassle is to have one person foot the bill and use Venmo to pay back the friend exactly what you owe \u2014 that way if you get something small, you don\u2019t get stuck paying more than you should.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I grab the check, knowing full well you\u2019ll Venmo me the funds \u2014 that\u2019s absolutely fine,\u201d Thomas said.\nWhoever does the asking should presumably be the one to pay the bill on a first date, Thomas insists.

In most cases, there is an expense account.

It opened up a huge debate about consent and what it looks like.\nWe realised that consent has a lot of grey areas and wanted to start a conversation about the spaces in between the black and white of consent; it\u2019s not as straightforward as no means no.\nHow was the idea put into action?\nWe put a Facebook post out asking women to share occasions when they had tried to say stop or slow down a sexual encounter without using the words.\nWe received hundreds of statements from women from around the world.\nWe then took 50 of those statements and created T-shirts which were made available for sale on an e-commerce site. And we asked 50 influencers to wear and post a pic on International Women\u2019s Day.\nOur aim was to start a conversation about consent, and in particular, enthusiastic consent.\nThe response has been incredible.\nNot only have we started a conversation about consent, but we have had contact with other countries and organisations wanting to replicate the idea in their own region.\nWe\u2019re also in conversations with universities and various festivals and support groups about consent education and how to change the conversation.\nUltimately we would love to see legislation changed as to what constitutes consent.\nThe Saxon Mullins case in NSW highlights the need for this clear understanding of what consent is. It\u2019s not just hearing someone say \u2018No\u2019. There are many ways we communicate, and this campaign is about those subtleties of that communication.\nWhat has been the benefit of using such a diverse group of women to demonstrate the issue?\nWe\u2019ve reached a very broad audience.\nThis issue about enthusiastic consent affects everyone; men and women. Women want to be heard and men have been very open to being educated and enlightened as to how we communicate. It\u2019s been educational for everyone.\nHow have you used social media to generate attention?\nThe entire campaign was driven by social media.\nWe\u2019ve used Instagram and Facebook to drive the entire campaign. Recruiting influencers, and having everyone tag and share.\nWhat have been the ripple effects?\nProbably the biggest one is the cathartic and healing effect it seems to have had on people who have experienced sexual assault. Buying and wearing a t-shirt has helped them to heal their own personal experiences, and to communicate both online, and offline, with those around them.\nAnd the realisation that it is more than one day, International Women\u2019s Day. The campaign has a life of its own now and education and working with universities and schools is now our focus for stage 2.\nAs"}

Scott Walker's administration, as could stretches of state Highways 51, 53 and 151.\nThe proposal's lead sponsor in the Senate, Republican Devin LeMahieu of Oostburg, called it \"common sense legislation\" that left a final decision on the speed limits up to state transportation officials.\n\"This legislation authorizes, but does not require, the Department of Transportation to raise the speed limit on interstates and freeways where it is safe to do so,\" LeMahieu said.\nAll of Wisconsin's neighbors have maximum speed limits of 70 mph or higher, and Wisconsin is the only state between Pennsylvania and Oregon that doesn't have a maximum speed limit of at least 70 mph.\nSo far, Walker hasn't said whether he would sign the bill and the state DOT has not said how much time it would take to determine which highway stretches could rise to 70 mph and then change their signs accordingly. Spokeswomen for Walker and the DOT had no further comment on the Senate action beyond saying that their offices are monitoring the legislation.\nUntil now, opponents have blocked the proposal's passage in Wisconsin by arguing that there would be inevitable safety effects from allowing the higher speeds. But a compromise among GOP lawmakers cleared the way for the proposal to move forward by ensuring that highways with at-grade crossings for intersecting roads or even driveways couldn't be cleared for 70 mph speeds.\nAAA Wisconsin has argued that the speed limit should not be changed in Wisconsin, particularly for heavy trucks, because an increase of 5 mph could lengthen the stopping distance for those vehicles by as much as 100 feet, or 20%. The motorists group cites federal data showing that large trucks were involved in 7.4% of fatal crashes in Wisconsin in 2012, while Minnesota and Iowa \u2014 which allow trucks to travel 70 mph on rural highways \u2014 had rates of 10% and 13.2%, respectively.\nDemocrats such as Rep.

It also holds many of that city's pioneers. Among them are several Civil War veterans, including one known as \"the fighting reverend.\"\nLonely and forlorn, ravaged by vandals and threatened by encroaching buckthorn and other overgrowth from a nearby woods, it is a cemetery in a battle for its life.\nThough Atkinson Cemetery in Cottage Grove and Mount Hope Cemetery in Afton are of the same vintage, historic significance and background, their fates have taken decidedly contrasting turns.\nThe status of Minnesota's historic cemeteries is reflected in these two graveyards.\nThere are more than 4,000 cemeteries and farm burial grounds in Minnesota; many are abandoned or under threat of vandalism and neglect, their history forgotten. \"I would call it a significant problem,\" said Bonnie McDonald, executive director of the Minnesota Preservation Alliance.\nIn 2002, the alliance placed Mount Hope Cemetery on its Top 10 list of most endangered historic sites in the state. The cemetery had been abandoned, and Washington County was considering the site as a location for a new radio tower, McDonald said.\nSince then, the graveyard has been removed from the endangered list: the county placed its antenna elsewhere because the city's title to the cemetery land was unsettled.\nWhile that may be good news in the short term, McDonald said, Mount Hope still faces the same problems as other historic cemeteries across the state.\n\"Reinvesting or donating money to preserve cemeteries is a harder sell\" compared to buildings, McDonald said. \"It takes people.\"\nTwo people, E.

Raspberry and blackcurrant cordials can kill bacteria that cause some stomach bugs.\nHave you ever used cordial to prevent gastro bugs? Have your say on the messageboard below.\nFor most of us, cordial is off the shopping list; we avoid it because it's full of sugar, bad for our teeth and some of its artificial colourings can make some kids hyperactive.\nBut raspberry cordial has some very loyal fans, who don't necessarily enjoy its sweet taste.\nThese people keep it in the pantry because they swear it can prevent \u0096 and possibly treat \u0096 stomach bugs. And they may be right, says microbiologist Dr Heather Cavanagh, whose research found some raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice cordials can kill at least 12 different types of nasty bacteria responsible for stomach bugs, including E. Coli and several strains of salmonella.\nCavanagh first became interested in the use of raspberry cordial as a preventative and treatment of stomach bugs when she heard that some farmers in parts of New South Wales and Victoria were adding raspberry cordial to their livestock's drinking water to treat diarrhoea.\nShe also began to hear stories of other people using raspberry cordial to treat stomach bugs: \"I heard anecdotal reports from as far away as Queensland and Western Australia, I heard of how people used it to treat themselves and their family. Not just their animals\".\nSo she decided to see if there was any science to support these anecdotal reports.\nIn the lab, Cavanagh tested juice made from a number of fresh berries \u0096 including raspberries, blackberries, blackcurrants, cranberries, mulberries, loganberries and boysenberries \u0096 as well as commercially available cordials made from these berries (these cordials were made with real berry juice, not apple juice and artificial colours as is sometimes the case).\nThese juices and cordials were then diluted down with water to different strengths, the strongest was one part water to five parts cordial and the weakest was 1:100. Then each type of bacteria was mixed with each of the berry drinks. The researchers found a number of the raspberry and blackcurrant juice cordials killed most of the bacteria.\nAnd while there has been some speculation that it's the sugar content of cordials that kills bacteria, Cavanagh says there is something unique to raspberry and blackcurrant juices, which seems to be responsible.\nThose cordials that had the best antibacterial properties contained at least 35 per cent raspberry or blackcurrant juice, and worked when diluted down to one part cordial in 10 parts water. Undiluted raspberry juice and blackcurrant juice worked just as well as the cordials.\nBut, Cavanagh says, there's a hitch. While her research suggests there's some truth to the red cordial story, there haven't been any clinical trials testing whether raspberry cordial can prevent or treat stomach bugs in humans or animals.\n\"We know for certain that adding the right amount of these cordials to water will reduce the number of bacteria in the water,\" she says.\n\"[But] we cannot say for certain that the cordial will definitely prevent stomach bugs in people, and we don't know yet if it will help as a treatment if you are already feeling sick.

There are several gashes on the whale\u2019s side, though it is still unclear how the whale died. More details will become available after Diane Alps, President of the Channel Island Marine and Wildlife Institute and her colleagues release information from a necropsy performed March 25. According to the CHP, authorities do not plan on removing the carcass of the whale and will instead let nature take its course and carry the body out to sea.\nWhile experts were performing the necropsy on the 40-foot long mammal, rescue crews just up the coast in Oxnard spent Monday attempting to rescue another gray whale trapped in a bouy net near Channel Island Harbour. Spotted by passengers on a boat Sunday, responders Monday and Tuesday had a difficult time untangling the whale, which is around 20-feet long, due to the animal\u2019s skittishness.\n\u201cEvery time we tried to get close to it, the whale would get scared and dive underwater, taking the buoy with it,\u201d Mark Barney, a spokesperson for the United States Coast Guard (USCG), told the Los Angeles Times.\nAccording to Barney, because the whale kept swimming away, authorities have been unable to tell if the whale is injured, distressed or to what degree the animal is entangled. To help with the rescue, the USCG called in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for assistance.\nIn the 17th century, gray whales were on the verge extinction due to commercial whaling, and while the Pacific Ocean population has since recovered, groups in the Atlantic Ocean never did. There are currently around 26,000 gray whales found throughout the world, all in the Pacific Ocean, and their Eastern North Pacific stock is the largest group. According to the Marine Mammal Center, gray whales have the longest migrations of any mammal.\nDuring summer, gray whales live in the Arctic in areas rich in their food, bottom-dwelling organisms. As fall arrives, however, there is less sunlight, less food, and the water turns cold, and the whales swim to Baja California, Mexico where they enter lagoons to give birth and mate. Therefore, gray whales can be observed passing by California in December and January during their southern migration, and again in March, April, and May on their northern journey. As human activity has increased along gray whales\u2019 migration route, these mammals are facing a new set of challenges.\nWhile authorities have yet to determine the cause of the gray whale\u2019s death in Malibu, the incident near Channel Island Harbour is a stark reminder of the impact human activity can have on these giant mammals."}

Now Afghan Fighters Are a Worry at Home.\nYAKAWLANG, Afghanistan \u2014 Iran has trained and deployed thousands of Shiite Afghans as shock troops in Syria\u2019s sectarian war. Members of the Afghan unit, the Fatemiyoun Division, wear a shoulder patch recounting words of praise from Iran\u2019s supreme leader as a badge of honor.\nWhat those fighters might do when they come home is now very much on the minds of officials who fear that Afghanistan may become the next great sectarian battleground between Iran, as the declared guardian of Shiites, and Saudi Arabia, long the sponsor of conservative Sunni doctrine around the world.\nThere is reason for worry. First, there\u2019s a history: The factional divisions that drove Afghanistan\u2019s devastating civil war in the 1990s were seized on by foreign powers who were seeking proxies. And there\u2019s a new concern: A stark increase in attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s Shiite minority, mostly by Sunni extremists loyal to the Islamic State, is already providing Iran a pretext to increase its meddling in the country.\nThe attacks have received wide coverage in the Iranian news media. And one Fatemiyoun fighter who returned about three months ago from Syria said the violence against Afghan Shiites was a frequent topic raised by their commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\nThe Afghan fighter had returned to his home in Yakawlang, a village in Bamian Province where the Taliban massacred more than 300 Shiites in 2001. Every year, hundreds of residents kneel on the dirt in a hilltop cemetery and beat their chests in mourning for their loved ones, their names listed on a metal sign worn out by time and covered in rust.\n\u201cThe Guards commanders were saying that, if it comes to it, we will make Bamian into a base for you, a base for Fatemiyoun,\u201d said the returning fighter, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being singled out for attack.\n\u201cThere was always talk about that; the commander would say that one day you will go defend in your own country,\u201d said another fighter, who had lived in Iran for 20 years as a refugee before he joined to go to Syria. He said he enlisted after he saw a video of Islamic State fighters \u201cplaying football with a chopped head.\u201d His relatives said he joined after a romantic heartbreak.\nIran has long relied more on soft power than armed might in Afghanistan, playing up its cultural, religious and economic influence in western Afghan districts near the border. And though Iran resents the presence of the United States military on its border, it has mostly supported the American-backed administration in Kabul, choosing stability over chaos.\nBut as the war in Afghanistan has stretched late into a second decade, and with the stability of the central government in question, Iran has begun hedging its bets, American and Afghan officials say. That has extended to improving its ties with the Taliban, a group it had long seen as an ideological enemy.\nAfghan officials acknowledge that they have not yet seen evidence that Iran was actively rallying Fatemiyoun veterans. But the officials are deeply concerned that the groundwork is being laid. And statements by Iran\u2019s military leaders, as well as their use of Afghan fighters in other conflicts, suggests that Iran sees the force as an asset in future engagements.\nBrig. Gen.

Over the past nine years, the agency\u2019s Office for Students and Young Consumers recovered $750 million for students defrauded by lenders and con artists.\nThe student lending office also helped more than 60,000 students from every state get answers about breakdowns in their loan process.

{"idx": "618", "prompt": "Continue the following text: For politicians, compromise can be a surprisingly hard word. So it is today over the Brexit endgame. The talk is still of crashing out, no deals and blood red lines. But this is paradoxical. Politics, like life itself, is mostly built on compromises. That is why the Brexit sherpas are, in fact, still talking in Brussels and London. Even on Brexit, it remains likelier than not that the practical human instinct to compromise will eventually have its way.\nThis is not, though, the certainty it ought logically to be. Brexit is not simply another political process to be settled through compromise. To many, it is also a series of absolutes. One is that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union was not just decisive but the immutable will of an entire people that cannot be questioned \u2013 or compromised. A second, never properly understood in Westminster, is that the EU sees leaving as a treaty process governed by rules that cannot be bent.\nYet, as the writer Fintan O\u2019Toole argued in a lecture this week, Brexit is not in practice monolithic. Indeed, Brexit metamorphosed at the precise moment that the leave vote was declared in 2016. With that declaration, Brexit moved from being a reactionary vision of restored British national destiny to being a practical and complicated task for politicians to sort out.\nMore than two years on, it still is. For the fanatical leavers, Brexit remains what O\u2019Toole calls an epic dream. That is one reason why people such as Boris Johnson refuse to accept ownership of the Brexit detail. For passionate remainers, it is the exact opposite, an epic nightmare against which only a second referendum, negating the collective national sin of the first, will suffice. Somewhere in the middle, however, stretching from deep inside the leave vote across the Brexit divide to somewhere well into remain, there are the many who now simply want a compromise they can live with.\nTheresa May is the flawed and awkward tribune of these pragmatists. It is a major part of her failure that she has never properly embraced this inescapable role. After 2016, she could and should have reached out to remainers by pledging to secure as moderate a Brexit as possible. Instead, she threw in her lot with the fundamentalist leavers in speeches to the 2016 Tory conference and at Lancaster House. This led remainers \u2013 and, just as important, the EU27 \u2013 to conclude that she wanted nothing more than a vestigial free trade deal and a minimum of regulatory cooperation.\nSince her failed general election, and in a characteristically last-minute, crabwise manner, May has sometimes crept towards a more centrist position. But she has done it in the least politically intelligent way possible. Instead of trying to use Brexit to reimagine modern Britain in a fairer way, as, at his best, her former adviser Nick Timothy urged her to do, she used it to indulge post-imperial fantasists on the right of the Tory party and the press, and to embrace forms of Ulster unionism that are rooted in the 1920s not the 2020s.\nMay should have embraced some of the language and ideas of \u201csoft\u201d Brexit from the start. By doing so, especially after her June 2017 election catastrophe,she could have laid the ground for the necessary later cross-party understandings on the Brexit deal. She could, in particular, have tried to win round the SNP"}

{"idx": "621", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In 2004, Google promised to transform philanthropy. That goal remains elusive.\nJUST before Google first sold its shares to the public in 2004, Larry Page, one of its founders, excited the nonprofit world with a bold commitment to philanthropy.\nHe vowed to dedicate about 1 percent of Google\u2019s profits, 1 percent of its equity and a significant amount of its employees\u2019 time to the effort, which became known as Google.org, or simply DotOrg. \u201cWe hope someday this institution may eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact by ambitiously applying innovation and significant resources to the largest of the world\u2019s problems,\u201d Mr. Page wrote in a letter to potential investors.\nAlthough Google intended to tackle major problems like climate change, global poverty and the spread of pandemic diseases, it declared that DotOrg would not be \u201cconventional\u201d \u2014 a four-letter word in Google-speak. For starters, the organization would operate in part as a business, thus freeing itself from various constraints placed on nonprofit groups.\nGoogle hired Larry Brilliant, a public health expert and Silicon Valley entrepreneur with no experience running a major philanthropy, to lead DotOrg, which was set up as a business unit within the company. It then poached prominent experts in development, energy and public health from prestigious institutions like the Aga Khan Foundation, Goldman Sachs and the International Water Management Institute.\nNearly five years later, however, the hyperbole looks more like hubris. DotOrg has narrowed to just one octave on the piano: engineering-related projects that often are the outgrowth of existing Google products. Dr. Brilliant was sidelined in early 2009 after his loose management style created much disenchantment in DotOrg\u2019s ranks.\nThe company\u2019s top executives rarely mention DotOrg, which is now run by Megan Smith, a business development executive who devotes only part of her time to the organization.\nAlthough Google gives tens of millions of dollars to charity each year and says the overall company is meeting its 1 percent giving goal, DotOrg itself is no longer making grants to nonprofit groups or financing new companies. Instead, it focuses on projects like using Google Earth to track environmental changes and monitoring Web searches to detect flu outbreaks. Most of the experts it initially hired have left, and Google, a company obsessed with numbers and metrics, struggles to measure DotOrg\u2019s accomplishments.\nGoogle says it has changed its approach to philanthropy, but not its scope or ambition. Ms. Smith readily acknowledges that the organization has yet to prove itself, but she says it has already had a positive impact in various areas, such as public health and the environment.\nIn the philanthropy world, many people have a more skeptical view of Google\u2019s experiment.\nNOTHING illustrates DotOrg\u2019s approach better than Google Flu Trends, an innovative tool that uses data collected from searches about flu symptoms to predict the location of flu outbreaks. In April 2009, Dr. Brilliant said it epitomized the power of Google\u2019s vaunted engineering prowess to make the world a better place, and he predicted that it would save untold numbers of lives.\nPublic health officials say the tool is undoubtedly useful.\nBut \u201con an individual basis, does Flu Trends save lives? No,\u201d said Ashley LaMonte-Fowlkes, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which helped Google test and develop it."}

According to the official press release, Disney has agreed to fork over $4.05 billion in cash and stock for George Lucas\u2019 studio in a deal that brings together two of the world\u2019s most important intellectual property libraries.\nAs you might expect, Disney is itching to take advantage of its new toys. \u201cThis transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content including Star Wars, one of the greatest family entertainment franchises of all time, with Disney\u2019s unique and unparalleled creativity across multiple platforms, businesses, and markets to generate sustained growth and drive significant long-term value,\u201d said Disney CEO Robert Iger in this afternoon\u2019s announcement.\nUnder the terms of this agreement Disney will acquire control over all Lucasfilm iterations. This includes both its traditional film-making studio facilities, as well as the various technologies Lucasfilm has created over the years to further its various media properties. Thus, the gigantic Disney family now includes Lucasfilm itself, special effects house Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, the company\u2019s video game creation division.\nThis acquisition alone would be huge news, but as if to pre-empt fan speculation on the future of Star Wars the same announcement also mentions that a new Star Wars movie is scheduled to appear in 2015. Though the vast majority of recent Star Wars media has been focused on the property\u2019s various animated iterations and LEGO crossovers, this new film will be the first official cinematic continuation of George Lucas\u2019 original Star Wars trilogy. Though very few details are offered on this film, it has officially been dubbed Star Wars: Episode VII, and barring any major catastrophes it should hit theaters at some point in 2015 (if we had to guess, we\u2019d assume an early summer release in keeping with the tradition established by its predecessors).\nPerhaps even more intriguing however, is the announcement\u2019s claim that Episode VII\u2019s release will herald a new era in which new Star Wars movies hit theaters \u201cevery two to three years.\u201d It specifically mentions Episodes VIII and IX by name, though offers no solid details on either film.\nWhile the effects of the move won\u2019t be fully known for at least a few months, we can think of a number of a things this new union might change. For instance, currently Dark Horse Comics publishes all Star Wars comic books, but with Disney owning Marvel Comics we can\u2019t see that agreement lasting for long. Likewise, both Disney and Lucasfilm have sizable divisions dedicated to creating video games based on their various media properties. Normally these companies have had to seek outside publishing agreements, but now that they\u2019ve joined forces and massively expanded the number of games either company is capable of releasing in any given year, it makes a lot of sense for Disney to invest in its own games publishing wing.\nFinally, this agreement almost certainly heralds future crossovers between Disney and Lucasfilm characters. We don\u2019t know any specifics, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see toys depicting Mickey Mouse dressed as Darth Vader. Whether that sounds awesome or stomach-churningly disgusting is entirely up to your rapidly waning sense of childhood whimsy.\nUpdate: Scratch that last prediction. Apparently Disney characters dressed as Star Wars characters is already a thing.\nOur partnership with LucasFilm has produced over 20 yrs worth of stories. We have Star Wars for the near future, and hope for years to come."}

{"idx": "630", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In days gone by, when our economy was dominated by agriculture and manufacturing, an employee\u2019s value was gauged by their inputs into the company. If they slacked off by not placing a bumper on a car fast enough, they were unproductive. And if they slept on the job, they were stealing time from their employers and could be fired.\nToday, however, we live in what is largely a knowledge economy in which an employee\u2019s value is based on their outputs, not their inputs. This means their performance is often more about ultimate results and less about the hours clocked.\nIn the knowledge economy, we want employees to be alert, not just active; engaged, not just present. We want them to be focused on producing the highest quality outputs possible.\nSleeping on the job can make this happen.\nAccording to the National Safety Council in the United States, almost 70 percent of employees are tired at work.\nThis level of fatigue is estimated to cost US$410 billion annually in societal expenses. As I discuss in my latest book \u201cBoost: The science of recharging yourself in an age of unrelenting demands\u201c, healthy adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night, but many of us don\u2019t get enough shut-eye.\nThirty-five percent of the population gets less than seven hours of sleep per night. Between 1985 and 2012 the percentage of adults in the United States who slept less than six hours a night increased by over 30 percent. And, compared to 60 years ago, today people get one and a half to two hours less sleep every night.\nThe ensuing sleepiness results in potential dangers both on and off the job. For example, about one in 25 drivers report having fallen asleep at the wheel in the last 30 days.\nThe problem is so bad that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers inadequate sleep to be a public health epidemic.\nPart of the explanation for this level of fatigue is that the boundary between work and home is blurring. Ninety-five percent of Americans now own a cellphone and 77 percent own a smartphone.\nAs a result of the ubiquity of communication technologies, employees can now be contacted any time of the day or night, on or off the job. Research shows that 84 percent of employees report having to be available after hours at least some of the time.\nThis essentially puts employees \u201con call.\u201d And guess what happens when people are on call? They don\u2019t sleep as well.\nSo not only do societal trends reveal an overall reduction in sleep duration, technological trends that blur the boundary between work and home are intensifying our inability to get adequate sleep. This is tragic because work tires us out and sleep is one of the most important recovery mechanisms that exist.\nTo combat the epidemic of sleepiness, we should allow the blurring of the line between work and home to go both ways. If employees are going to be required to be available after hours, they should also be allowed to sleep on the job.\nIf employers are going to interfere with employees\u2019 leisure time and their ability to recover from their daily job demands, organizations should then provide opportunities for the needed recovery to occur at work.\nThere is a strong business case for this. Naps as short as 10 to 30 minutes can increase alertness, reduce fatigue and improve performance. Not only that, but recent research suggests that napping may be as effective as drugs at reducing blood pressure. That\u2019s means organizations that implement napping policies can save on health-care costs.\nMany companies, such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s"}

We've seen contemporary variations of these to converted shepherd's wagons covered with canvas and actually used as rustic living spaces. Ontario-based Canadian builder G\u00fcte (previously) constructed this lovely specimen that seems to be a cross between a shepherd's wagon, a camper and modernist tiny home. Dubbed the Collingwood, it sports rounded surfaces and nice, clean wooden surfaces inside.\nWe built the Collingwood shepherd hut without clear distinctions of where the walls become the floor or roof of this shepherd hut. It is wrapped in and organic shell that fulfills the functions of all three of these important traditional structural elements. We wrapped the roof all the way around the Collingwood in a fluid wooden framed structure that sheds off every kind of bad weather. The exterior shell is fully insulated with batt insulation and waterproofed using the best ice and water shield. We use a combination of two types of roof cladding which will keep the weather out for a lifetime.\nThere are thermal-paned windows that open, a solid oak dutch door, cast-iron wheels, traditional cast-iron push hardware and brass window locks, cedar shingles and steel roof cladding. It has two electrical outlets, and can be plugged in via the exterior. But there's a lot of camper-ish inspirations here too, as evidenced by the classic dining-table-turns-into-bed gambit.\nThe 15-foot Collingwood can fit a whole family, thanks to the bunk bed off to the other side of the space, which has yet another roll-out storage platform tucked underneath, which could probably double as yet another bed. There's a wall unit that hosts storage and a fold-down table as well.\nWith no built-in bathroom or kitchen, this is a pretty basic setup priced for USD $23,098. But the meticulous craftsmanship and interesting hybrid design may be worth it for those who want to live the modern shepherd lifestyle.

As against the policy that attracted fresh investments in ginning, spinning and garmenting, the assistance scheme covers segments such as weaving, knitting, dyeing/printing, machine carpeting, technical textile, composite units and other activities in the textile value chain such as embroidery, winding, sizing, twisting and crimping.\nThe scheme provides financial assistance through credit-linked interest subsidy of six per cent for micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and 4-6 per cent for large enterprises, with an upper ceiling of Rs 20 crore per annum. Further, the scheme offers subsidy in power tariff of up to Rs 3 per unit for weaving, and Rs 2 per unit for other eligible segments with a validity of five years.\n\u201cThe assistance scheme for textile value chain is meant for new units being set up in Gujarat. However, there is nothing for the existing scheme. On the basis of the subsidy, the newer units would be more cost-effective, and compete with us on price difference. Already, the existing textile industry in Gujarat is struggling because of multiple reasons. Hence, we are going to ask the state government for some relief against the new scheme,\u201d said Jitu Vakharia, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors\u2019 Association (SGTPA).\nAlready, around 30 textile processing units have been shut in recent months, with the remaining 320 odd units functioning at only 70 per cent of the original capacity. Surat, the biggest textile market in the state, alone has seen daily production fall from 40 million metre per day to 25 million metre per day.\nAccording to industry sources, based on the subsidy under the new scheme, newer units could carry a 15-20 per cent production cost advantage over the existing ones.\n\u201cAny such policy is for new investment, but this aggravates the scenario for the existing units. Earlier, we were facing competition from outside, but now the competition will be closer home. It is only now that the industry is reviving in terms of growing demand in the last fortnight or so. The move could pull us back unless similar benefits are provided for the existing units,\u201d said Ashish Gujarati, president of the Pandesara Weavers\u2019 Association.\nApparently, the scheme also offers assistance covering all existing units which are compliant with the government\u2019s energy, water and environment conservation norms, and have been in operation for more than three years.\nThe scheme provides 20 per cent assistance on the cost of machinery with a ceiling of Rs 30 lakh, and 50 per cent assistance for audit fees with a limit of Rs 1 lakh.

It is often a stepping stone to starting a career in a full-time fire department.\nThat said, it\u2019s not something that everyone can undertake. It takes a great deal physical stamina and mental strength to make this kind of commitment.\nWhat should I know about becoming a volunteer firefighter?\nKeep a clear head in life-or-death situations.\nMaintain your composure when assisting traumatic events like auto crash injuries and fatalities.\nPut yourself in extreme situations, such as going into burning buildings, crawling through tight spaces and entering other hazardous environments.\nMost volunteer fire departments want you to devote a minimum amount of time to service, so make sure you have time in your schedule and the flexibility to make that work. It also means that you must have the time to devote to the requisite firefighter training course. The length of the training can vary by state and the level of certification required \u2014 a Firefighter I certification may take six months of attending class two to three days per week.\nYou must also commit to staying in great physical condition to maintain the stamina to perform the necessary firefighting tasks. Eat right, exercise and reduce or eliminate habits that can adversely affect your health, like tobacco and alcohol use. Here are three specific steps to take to become a volunteer firefighter.\nThe first step should always be to make sure that there is a need. During your call or visit, ask questions about the process so you understand what to expect as you become a volunteer firefighter.\nIf there isn\u2019t a volunteer fire station in your community, check out surrounding areas.\nSome fire departments do have residency restrictions, so ask about those in your call.\nCall the non-emergency number and avoid tying up the fire dispatcher.\nMany fire stations will welcome you to drop in if they\u2019re not busy.\nSome fire departments let you ride along with them, or tour their station to give you firsthand experience working in fire safety.\nThey can also direct you to the proper authorities to help you get signed up.\nA background check to see if you have anything in your history that would prevent you from becoming a volunteer firefighter.\nClearance by a doctor or a physical ability test, some fire departments require both.\nFire departments controlled by a municipal government often require a full application process, usually including a drug test.\nIf your application is approved, the next step in becoming a volunteer fireman or firewoman is to take the training course. The time requirement of these programs varies, but all firefighters must take a minimum 110-hour National Fire Protection Association-certified course.\nWhile this may not be as glamorous as fighting fires, all are an important part of running a volunteer fire department.\nMany departments offer emergency medical services and encourage members to earn EMS certifications.

But as media consumption habits have changed, with users increasingly accessing weather information when and how they want it on their iPhones and Droids, WeatherNation is more in tune with products for people on the go.\nWeather is an enormous driver of traffic to local news.

That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products. For example, Canadians pay $5.24 for a 10.5-ounce block of cheddar. In Washington, D.C., that same amount of cheddar sells for $3.64. Canadians pay $3.99 for a 1-pound container of yogurt. In Washington, D.C., you can get nearly twice as much yogurt for a little over $4. It\u2019s clear that the Canadian government\u2019s tariffs screw its citizens by forcing them to pay higher prices for dairy products.\nWhat should the U.S. response be to Canada\u2019s screwing its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might propose imposing tariffs on soft wood products that Americans import from Canada \u2014 in other words, retaliate against Canada by screwing American citizens. Canadian lumber \u2014 such as that from pine, spruce and fir trees \u2014 is used in U.S. homebuilding. Guess what tariffs on Canadian lumber do to home prices. If you answered that they raise the cost and American homebuyers are forced to pay higher prices, go to the head of the class.\nThe ruse used to promote producer interests through tariff policy is concern about our large trade deficit. It\u2019s true that we have a large current account trade deficit. However, that\u2019s matched exactly by a very large capital account surplus. Translated, that means Americans buy more goods from other countries than they buy from us; that\u2019s our current account deficit. But other countries find our investment climate attractive and invest more in the U.S. than we invest in other countries; that\u2019s our capital account surplus.\nHave you ever wondered why foreigners are willing to invest far more money in Texas and California than they are willing to invest in Argentina and Venezuela? Do you think it\u2019s because they like North Americans better than they like South Americans? No. We\u2019ve always had an attractive investment climate, and we\u2019ve had current account deficits and capital account surpluses throughout most of our nation\u2019s history. In fact, the only time we had a sustained current account trade surplus was during the Great Depression, when we had a surplus in nine out of 10 years, with 1936 being the lone exception.\nLet\u2019s delve a bit into the politics of trade tariffs. Whom do we see spending the most resources lobbying for tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum? Is it American users of steel and aluminum, such as Harley-Davidson and John Deere? Or is it United States Steel Corp. and Alcoa? Of course it\u2019s U.S. Steel and Alcoa. They benefit from tariffs by being able to sell their products at higher prices. Harley-Davidson and John Deere lose by having to pay higher prices for their inputs, steel and aluminum, and their customers lose by having to pay higher product prices.\nThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense talk about international trade, which some define as one country\u2019s trading with another.

{"idx": "659", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Shares of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) fell 10.3% in November, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Weighing on the oil stock was the price of crude, which plunged last month, overshadowing the company's solid third-quarter results.\nCrude prices tumbled 22% due to a complete reversal of the market's view on the oil supply picture. Instead of worrying that there might not be enough oil to meet demand as the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran, the market is now concerned that there may be too much after the U.S. granted waivers so that most of Iran's customers could continue buying its oil. That slump in crude caused most oil stocks to sell off last month, since lower prices will impact their cash flows. In Marathon's case, it had generated $630 million in excess cash this year due to higher-than-expected oil prices, the bulk of which it used to buy back stock.\nThat slump in oil prices caused investors to quickly forget about Marathon Oil's strong third-quarter results. The company earned an adjusted $0.24 per share for the quarter, which beat the consensus estimate by $0.04 per share. Further, thanks to its strong drilling results this year, Marathon now expects to grow its production from shale by 30% to 34%, which is up from its prior range of 28% to 32%. What makes that even more impressive is that Marathon is growing at a faster pace without increasing capital spending.\nWhile the slump in oil prices will cut into Marathon's cash flow, the company remains well positioned to handle lower oil prices. That's because it built its business to thrive on $50 oil and also has a cash-rich balance sheet to help cushion the blow. That's why last month's sell-off looks like a good buying opportunity for those who are bullish on oil over the long term."}

Cats know how to sleep and can sleep anywhere they want to \u2014 any table, chair, top of a shelf, window ledge, in the laundry basket, on freshly ironed clothes, the newspaper, on the edge of just about anything. There\u2019s no doubt about it. Did you know that the only animals that can sleep more than us are the opossum and the bat?\nAs first cousins to the king of the jungle, we follow the pattern of hunters \u2014mostly active during dawn and dusk because that is the time they could catch their prey. Such animals are c-r-e-p-u-s-c-u-l-a-r; a word longer than my tail! So our sleep pattern leaves us with plenty of time to sleep for hours during the rest of the day and night, or to break it into little naps.\nOf course, as a modern day indoor cat, one that is very well-fed and spoilt, I also sleep out of boredom, laziness and having nothing majorly exciting to do.\nSince cats in the wild must be on the alert in order to survive, we as domestic cats also follow the same pattern. Even when you think that we are deep asleep, our finely tuned senses are still active and ready to spring into action. If you watch your cat while he\u2019s napping, you will see that his ears may rotate from time to time because he is in touch with his environment, and if he hears a noise or senses that someone is approaching, he will open his eyes to check out the situation before falling back to sleep. Try waking me up from my sleep, and I can transform from a deeply sleeping cat to a fully alert one in a matter of seconds. If I realise in the next minute that it was not really worth getting up, I can go back to sleep again.\nWhere does your cat sleep? Cuddled in the crook of your knees on your bed? On the larger part of your pillow leaving just a little space for your head? Or right against the closed door to your bedroom?\nHumans also wonder why we sleep the way we sleep. Sometimes curled up, and at other times on our backs, like humans. What happens is that when the weather is warm, we look for cool places like the floor where we can stretch out.

Our reporters assess some of the more innovative work going on across the UK.\nLater this year, doctors in London hope to start the first human trial of a radical new treatment for children with drug-resistant leukaemia. One- or two-year-old infants will have gone through multiple rounds of chemotherapy, to no avail. The best hospitals can do is make them comfortable.\nThe therapy is one of the most sophisticated medicine has ever seen. White blood cells \u2013 part of the immune system\u2019s frontline defences \u2013 are collected from a healthy donor and effectively turned into a drug through genetic engineering. First, they are modified to hunt down their target: a protein that appears on leukaemia blood cells. Next, they are tweaked to make them invisible to drugs that suppress the child\u2019s immune system during the treatment. Finally, the cells are modified again to ensure that when they are infused they do not attack the child.\nIf the trial is approved and goes as planned, about 50 million modified cells will course into the arteries and veins of each sick child and destroy the leukaemia cells . The hope is to drive the cancer into deep remission within four to six weeks. The children can then have bone marrow transplants to reboot their immune systems. When bone marrow transplants are done without clearing leukaemia first, the disease has a tendency to come back. A similar procedure has already shown promise in adults.\nA medical team at Great Ormond Street hospital will run the trial for a French pharmaceutical company called Servier. But they have already had a glimpse of what the cells can do for children. Last June, a one-year-old girl, Layla Richards, became the first infant with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to have the therapy. Her cancer did not respond to several rounds of chemotherapy and she had only a few months to live.\nLayla\u2019s medical team had some modified immune cells on ice \u2013 prepared for the trial by researcher Hong Zhan. It had taken her 18 days to modify and purify the cells in a small clean room on the hospital\u2019s lower ground floor. The team thawed the cells out and gave them to Layla in June under a special licence granted by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Layla\u2019s leukaemia abated and she had a bone marrow transplant three months later. So far, she is doing well.\n\u201cThis could really only have happened on the NHS, where there is a wealth of expertise and people across many disciplines willing to give their time and energy,\u201d said Prof Waseem Qasim, leader of the clinical trial.\nAt the cutting edge of keyhole surgery on the NHS is something that looks like a tiny pen lid-sized parasol.\nFor years, doctors have operated through tiny incisions to remove appendices and gallbladders, diagnose and treat cancers, even mend or replace valves and arteries around the heart. Now, at Bristol Heart Institute, there is a trial for an even more ambitious procedure: to perform keyhole surgery in the middle of the heart.\nEvery year, nearly 3,000 people in the UK have open-heart surgery to repair or replace their mitral valve, a small oval measuring about 3-5cm across, with an elliptical opening to allow blood to flow towards the aorta and out of the heart.

Casemates.com went live Thursday when the Kickstarter campaign started. It has two weeks to go and already exceeded its $50,000 goal in the first day. At 7:30 a.m. Friday, it had 1,081 backers pledging $70,732.\nRutledge, who is also co-founder and CEO of a Dallas-based tech incubator called Mediocre Corporation, said Wine.Woot pioneered the winery-direct retail model.\nCasemates plans to offer new wine deals three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Heightened political uncertainty has placed the sovereign credit rating for Pakistan under question by international rating agencies. Pakistan\u2019s risk on the international markets has risen.\nPakistani five-year credit default swaps, used to insure against restructuring or defaulting debt, have widened by around 100 basis points to 480 basis points since the assassination, implying traders felt the country\u2019s debt was a higher risk. Some traders believe the credit default swaps on Pakistan debt may rise to 850 basis points.\nThe question is whether the political turmoil and unrest derails the economic reform process. Pakistan\u2019s economy has performed very well over the last few years, with strong economic growth and increased foreign investment, including much from the Gulf states.\nThe banking sector has recorded strong and increasing returns over the period. Forecast for economic growth is 7.2 per cent in the new year until June. Many foreign investors have seen Pakistan as a new breed of lesser-developed \u201cfrontier markets\u201d offering better returns than mainstream emerging markets.\nContrary to outsiders\u2019 opinion of the country, Pakistan has organisational structures in place that could allow the economy to continue on its growth path. However, the authorities need to ensure the country does not fall into a cycle of chaos.\nGulf financial institutions and investors have been active in Pakistan over the past few years. Dubai Islamic Bank launched an Islamic financial institution (pictured above) that has grown rapidly. There has also been a growing awareness of the benefits of Islamic banking in Pakistan.\nPakistan\u2019s banking sector has attracted foreign interest following a series of reforms and good performances that have led to rapid expansion and increasing income for local banks. Presently only Islamic banking is able to gain new banking licences, meaning that the only way foreigners can get into the market is to buy their way in.\nSamba Financial Group, the Saudi Arabian bank, acquired a 68 per cent stake in Crescent Commercial Bank of Pakistan. Other Gulf banks active in Pakistan include Emirates Global Islamic Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank. International banks have also been attracted by the market. Standard Chartered paid $487 million (Dh1.78 billion) in cash for a 95 per cent stake in Union Bank to create the sixth-largest bank in Pakistan. The price paid was 5.6 times the net asset value. ABN Amro acquired Prime Bank of Pakistan.\nHowever, the current situation is likely to delay any immediate investment deals in Pakistan, at least until after the elections, assuming they are held.

Sifting through this manually would take nearly three years, or about the same amount of time it would take to read War and Peace 571 times consecutively (debatable as to which fate is worse).

Adoption of the wrong platform might just exacerbate the issue. Non-intuitive visualizations and statistical views can lead to hours of screen staring and head scratching.\n* Broad collection \u2013 Make sure that all the log types you need are supported, including logs that originate from different operating systems, device types, and languages.\n* Aggregation \u2013 Log entries are structured/written in a wide variety of ways, depending on their point of origin. Aggregation helps clear up this chaos by correlating similar logs together based on their shared patterns or characteristics, e.g. the action performed or users performing them. An aggregation feature should have some level of customization, such as saving logs to user-defined groups for ongoing reference.\n* Search \u2013 A useful search function goes beyond a mere text box that returns matching log data. It\u2019s important that queries return not only search-specific data results, but also allow users to easily access the context of those results, i.e. what occurred immediately before and after in the log.\n* Alerts \u2013 A system should alert users to repeated error occurrences, system anomalies, or the absence of typical events. Make sure alert settings can be adjusted to different delivery methods, time intervals and priority levels.\nTechnologies may change dramatically from year to year, but time still equals money. Less time spent manually hunting bugs and system events leads to earlier and more rapid releases, more time for innovative feature development, and happier users. Those are the essential benefits from the DevOps perspective, but log analysis is a diverse art, and has a surprisingly broad range of uses.\nWho does it help beyond DevOps and IT?\nSecurity Engineers can exploit an Analysis platform\u2019s search tools to find suspicious actions or breaches. The ideal platform should save search queries for repeated use, and automate the searches for a regular interval of security checks.\nCompliance \u2013 Log analysis can help keep your product in line with a range of compliance laws, and a strong automation component can speed up the process of auditing and review.\nMarketing and UX \u2013 Tools like Google Analytics and HubSpot might generally be considered irreplaceable for usage and engagement analytics. However, log analysis provides the same essential data: user traffic, referrals, usage time, click rates \u2013 they\u2019re all in the log.\nThough some departments will be resistant to experimenting with what they per"}

In fact, Starboard suggested that if Advance Auto simply realizes margins and price multiples in line with close rival O&apos;Reilly Automotive, theshares could be worth more than double their current price.\nNow what: Starboard said that it will discuss the Advance Auto opportunity in greater detail at the C4K Sohn Canada Conference 2015 later Wednesday. \"In our presentation, we discuss how Advance&apos;s operating margins are approximately 800-900 basis points below its closets peers, O&apos;Reilly Automotive and AutoZone, and our belief that Advance can close the bulk of that gap over the next several years by implementing a series of operational improvements,\" wrote Starboard Managing Member Jeffrey Smith. \"Despite this tremendous margin improvement opportunity and a best-in-class business mix, Advance currently trades at an approximately 2-5 turn discount to its peers on an EBITDA multiple basis.\" While I&apos;d certainly wait for the short-term enthusiasm to fade a bit, Starboard&apos;s involvement might be a powerful long-term catalyst worth betting on.\nThe article Why Advance Auto Parts Shares Jumped This Morning originally appeared on Fool.com.\nBrian Pacampara has no position in any stocks mentioned.

According to a study conducted by New England Research Institutes in 2000, the worldwide prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 152 million in 1995. It is expected to increase to 322 million in 2025. Most of these cases are likely to occur in developing countries due to rise in geriatric aging population. Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are commonly used erectile dysfunction drugs across the globe. Viagra (sildenafil citrate) and other PDE 5 inhibitors such as Cialis (tadalafil) and Levitra/Staxyn (vardenafil) are extensively consumed for ED treatment worldwide.\nLoss of patent exclusivity of a branded drug results in revenue reduction by nearly 40% in the first year, which goes on decreasing to 30% and 20% in the following years. This is attributed to the launch of generic equivalents of these drugs being manufactured and marketed at 1/10th of the price of the original branded drug, thus resulting in higher consumption of generic drugs due to high efficacy and demand. Consequently, the generics segment is anticipated to be a promising area of investment even for original molecule manufacturers, as it is a mode of sustenance and offsetting expenditures of the companies.\nThe global erectile dysfunction drugs market is segmented based on drug, distribution channel, and geography. In terms of drug, the erectile dysfunction drugs market is divided into Viagra, Cialis, Staxyn/Levitra, Stendra/Spedra, and others. The others drug class includes Zydena (medicated urethral system for erection), Mvix, Helleva, Vitaros, Caverject Impulse, generic products, and pipeline products. Cialis (tadalafil) sales exceeded that of Viagra (sildenafil citrate) due to patent expiration of Viagra (sild"}

In this White House ceremony, President Obama noted it took more than four decades to bring the organizer of the murders, Edgar Ray Killen, to justice.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On June 21st, 1964, three young men\u2014two white and one black\u2014set out to learn more about the burning of a church in Neshoba County, Mississippi: James Earl Chaney, 21 years old; Andrew Goodman, 20 years old; Michael Henry Schwerner, 24 years old\u2014young men. And in that Freedom Summer, these three Americans refused to sit on the sidelines. Their brutal murder by a gang of Ku Klux Klan members shook the conscience of our nation. It took 44 days to find their bodies, 41 years to bring the lead perpetrator to justice.\nAnd while they\u2019re often remembered for how they died, we honor them today for how they lived\u2014with the idealism and the courage of youth. James, Andrew and Michael could not have known the impact they would have on the civil rights movement or on future generations. And here today, inspired by their sacrifice, we continue to fight for the ideals of equality and justice for which they gave their lives. Today we are honored to be joined by James\u2019s daughter Angela, Andrew\u2019s brother David, and Michaels wife Rita.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. We turn now to excerpts of a documentary titled Neshoba: The Price of Freedom, which tells the story of the three civil rights activists.\nNEWS ANCHOR: First, the known facts. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner went to Mississippi to help register Negroes as voters. Chaney, a 20-year-old Mississippian, was a veteran of the civil rights movement in his home state. He assisted in the training classes. Goodman, 20, a New York college student, had never participated in the civil rights movement, but a friend says Goodman could never understand how some people could be so lacking in compassion. Schwerner, 24, a seasoned New York social worker, left Mississippi where he had worked since January, to assist in the training school at Oxford, Ohio.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: The film, Neshoba, goes on to document the role local Mississippi law enforcement agents and the Ku Klux Klan played in the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.\nNEWS ANCHOR: It\u2019s 35 miles from Meridian to Philadelphia, then 12 miles to Longdale, where the church had been burned.

{"idx": "699", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This clears the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees on overdue loans.\nAccording to a Tuesday analysis from the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans have fallen behind on their student loans. The data, obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, reveals 42.4 million people in the U.S. owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans by the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average amount owed per borrower increased by 17 percent.\nBack in 2015, the Obama administration issued a memo that prevented debt collectors from charging high interest rates on overdue student loans. So long as the borrower entered the government\u2019s loan-rehabilitation program within 60 days of defaulting, agencies of the old, bank-based Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) were forbidden from charging up to 16 percent of personal and accrued interest. Still, some lawmakers argue that debt collectors continue to impose these fees, despite the Obama regulations.\nAs part of an ongoing legal case, the U.S. District Court gave the Trump administration until March 16 to decide whether to uphold the Obama-era guidelines.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, both Democrats, penned a letter Monday asking Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to uphold the previous memo. \u201cWe urge the [Department of Education] to stand by its previous guidance and give borrowers in default a chance to rehabilitate their loans and successfully repay their debt without being charged massive collection fees,\u201d the letter reads.\nThis request was short-lived. The Department of Education revoked the Obama guidelines on Thursday and instructed guarantee agencies (companies that issue government-backed student loans) to collect on defaulted debt.\nAs MarketWatch points out, a relatively small share of borrowers will be impacted by the new regulations. Starting in 2010, all new federal student loans were issued by the Department of Education, which doesn\u2019t charge collection fees to borrowers who quickly agree to make good on their defaults. As a result, students who have taken out federal loans in the last few years need not worry about an increase in fees.\nBut those who received loans from the FFELP\u2014which discontinued new loans in 2010\u2014have cause for concern. The Washington Post reports that nearly half of America\u2019s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday\u2019s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.\nOne of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input. Only time will tell what the public has to say about the new administration guidelines."}

It\u2019s harvest season, and for some, transporting cane across the Mississippi River is costing them more than they anticipated.\nSt. James sugarcane farmer and president of the East St. James Parish Farm Bureau Pete Dufresne enjoys tending to his 2,600-acre crop just off the river. In the fall, the combines, tractors, and trucks are rolling out the year\u2019s finest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harvest time, and this is where we make it. This is our whole year,\u201d Dufresne said.\nBut Dufresne is concerned about his profit this time around, and the weather has very little to do with it. His land is just off the Sunshine Bridge. Harvest season began on October 3, just nine days before a barge carrying a crane rammed into the bridge, damaging a major support beam. The bridge has been closed since for repairs and it\u2019s not expected to be back open until January, the end of harvest season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to affect the profit margin because, unfortunately, our sugar is sold at predetermined prices. We can\u2019t just increase the price of sugar to overcome the additional expenses,\u201d Dufresne said.\nThose additional expenses, Dufresne says, comes from the five extra trucks he has had to hire to haul his quota of cane to the mill each day. He says what used to be an 18-mile trip across the river is now approximately 50. The longer hours and extra fuel are adding up. \u201cA truck used to complete a trip in one hour and now it takes three hours,\u201d Dufresne said.\nAll that extra time is money Dufresne says he can\u2019t get back. The sight of the Sunshine Bridge under repair for the remainder of the season, Dufresne finds hard to stomach. \u201cSurely it was a completely avoidable incident. That\u2019s the most frustrating part about it. To me, it wasn\u2019t an accident, it was avoidable,\u201d Dufresne said.\nDufresne says so far, the closure has tripled his harvesting expenses."}

St. John&apos;s is a Catholic university of about 20,000 students located in the city&apos;s Queens borough.\nOther students, one of them a police cadet, reported seeing the armed man at around 2:30 p.m. walking near a building on the campus around the time he was supposed to be in a business class there, police said. The man was carrying a plastic bag with the barrel of a .50-caliber rifle sticking out and was wearing the Bush mask, with its mouth cut out.\nIn a statement, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly praised the cadet, 21-year-old Christopher Benson. Benson said he saw a man with a gun \"walking really fast\" and \"jumped right in\" to assist when campus security officers approached.\nUnarmed campus security officers and the student cadet tackled Hiraman as he walked toward a library, police said.

The market for crowdfunding is expected to grow to greater than $300 billion by 2025, according to Fundly, a crowdfunding website that promotes itself as a platform to \"raise money for anything.\"\nYet the realm of charitable crowdfunding is a legal Wild West, and rife with pitfalls for donors and recipients.\nShenkman said the gift-tax conundrum may arise when campaigns are organized by a friend or relative of the ultimate recipient, and the recipient will not be the one who withdraws funds.\nAlthough the gift-tax exclusion allows individuals to give up to $14,000 to a given recipient, in 2017, without filing a gift-tax return, the money must be immediately available to the recipient to qualify for this exclusion (in legal parlance, it must be a gift of \"present interest\"). If crowdfunding donations can't be immediately withdrawn by the recipient, they may not pass this test, Shenkman said.\n\"You have this absurd result, that people who are giving small dollar amounts may actually have a gift-tax reporting requirement that they may violate,\" said Shenkman.\nAnother headache for donors: their contributions aren't deductible unless they donate to a qualified organization such as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. That means you can't deduct an amount you donated to assist with an individual's medical bills, for example. Medical fundraising is the fastest-growing category on YouCaring, a platform for \"compassionate crowdfunding,\" according to the company's website.\nCrowdfunding websites provide varying levels of assistance to donors trying to navigate tax rules.\nGoFundMe maintains a list of \"Certified Charities\" that have been verified as nonprofits, and automatically sends donors tax receipts for contributions to campaigns that benefit one of those charities. But the platform also allows recipients not on that list to describe their campaigns as a \"charity\" on its website.\nThe website of Generosity, a platform for \"socially conscious fundraising\" owned by Indiegogo, states that donors should contact campaign organizers to determine if donations are tax deductible. The website advertises campaigns that claim to benefit registered nonprofits alongside campaigns that make no such claims.\nDonations can even create unintended headaches for recipients.\nIf a beneficiary receives means-tested government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income, then receiving a large cash inflow from a crowdfunding campaign could cause him or her to lose government"}

For example, replacing the weakly absorbing fullerenes with more strongly absorbing acceptors should lead to efficient light harvesting below 700nm (Figure 1) and increased short circuit current densities (Jsc). Assuming a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.75, Jsc can potentially be improved from 15.2 mA/cm2 in the record device to 17.2 mA/cm2 (Figure 2).\nFigure 3: Schematic of general strategy for materials design for application in OPVs.\nThe general strategy of how the materials will be designed to address important properties necessary for OPV acceptors is shown in Figure 3. The materials will have two different electron deficient moieties linked together in an A-B-A type arrangement. Furthermore the A-B-A moieties will be linked by alkene, alkyne and/or phenyl linkages (sp2 hybridization) that will allow for electron delocalization throughout the molecule, thus stabilizing the negative charge over the entire molecule. Although the A-B-A moieties will be electron deficient in nature, they will have different degrees of deficiency so as to have partial push-pull character. This is known to impart low band gap properties, important for absorbing a greater amount of the visible spectrum.\nThe proposed research is designed to be very interdisciplinary involving synthetic organic chemistry, materials characterization, and device processing/characterization. The research is aimed towards the goal of OPVs with PCEs >10% by the end of the project and will be divided into two sections \u2013 chemical synthesis and device physics. Design and synthesis of new electron deficient molecules will be carried out to achieve crucial fundamental properties such as: proper electronic energy levels; strong visible light absorption; side chain attachments for solution or vacuum processing; and solid-state packing for optimized charge transport. Charge carrier mobilities and solid state morphologies of neat and blend thin films using various microscopy and x-ray techniques will be examined.

{"idx": "732", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Despite the critique we have offered in the past, Zanu PF in its recently launched manifesto, insist on claiming that its vision is for Zimbabwe to be a middle-income country (MIC) by 2030.\nThis is a bland and banal statement which requires qualification, quantification and supporting details for it to be meaningful. What does that vision statement even mean?\nThe MIC nomenclature is a World Bank analytical tool that refers to economies with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranging from $1 005 to $12 235.\nThis is too broad a grouping. In any case our GDP per capita income is $977, hence jumping to $1 005 (if we consider minimum qualification) over 12 years is not sufficiently ambitious. This is not visionary at all.\nIt is instructive to note that the MICs are broken up into lower-MIC and upper-MICs.\nLower-MICs have GDP per capita ranging from $1 006 to $3 955, while upper-MICs have per GDP per capita ranging from $3 956 to $12 235.\nDoes Zanu PF aim for Zimbabwe to be a lower-MIC or an upper-MIC?\nMore importantly, what is the target GDP per capita in their vision formulation?\nThey must be specific and say we aim to be an MIC with a stated GDP per capita number (or range of numbers).\nEven with this flawed approach to the national vision process, there is need for caution.\nUnder this rule, the number of years to double a GDP per capita is equal to 70 divided by the growth rate.\nSo, for example, if we grow by 3%, then it will take us 70/3 = 23,33 years, to double our GDP per capita.\nIf we grow at 5%, then it will take us 14 years. For Zimbabwe to double its GDP per capita by 2030, that is, attain a GDP per capita of at least $1 944, it needs to grow by about 6% every year for the next 12 years \u2014 which is a tall order.\nChina did it though, but it is not easy. In Zanu PF\u2019s vision, what is the target growth rate for Zimbabwe for the next 12 years to 2030?\nIn the manifesto, there is target of attaining a growth rate of at least 6% per annum over the period 2018 to 2023. What happens beyond 2023? They do not tell us.\nLet us be generous and assume that Zanu PF wants to double our GDP per capita by 2030 \u2014 which would require an average growth of 6% for 12 years.\nThe problem is that it has been a historical impossibility, with the exception of China.\nFor example, between 1970 and 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries only grew by an average of 1,9%!\nWith Zimbabwe, for sure in the first few years, we may experience above average growth rates because of our low base, but we will eventually gravitate towards standard and traditional growth rates, which are much lower than 6%.\nMore significantly from my analysis of their entire Zanu"}

Olive oil, blessed by a bishop, is normally used for the anointing, but any vegetable oil may be substituted in case of emergency.\nThe institution of anointing by Christ is an article of the Catholic faith, defined by the Council of Trent (Denzinger 1716). The Church further teaches that this sacrament is implied in Gospel reference to Christ sending out the disciples, who \"anointed many sick people with oil and cured them\" (Mark 6:13); moreover that the sacrament was promulgated by the Apostle James when he wrote, \"Is anyone among you sick? Let him bring in the presbyters of the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

I wanted to know how the clouds were forming in the forest and if I could glean insight into water management strategies. After a quick search on AskNature.org, I discovered that pine needles use the strategy of high surface area to perform the function of collecting moisture.\nDozens of searches and many design iterations later, I learned that nature performs multiple functions using various strategies on all surface-, structure-, and systems-levels. Similar to the pine needles, an elephant's wrinkly skin and several desert plants, use the strategy of high surface area, to perform varied functions. Amongst these multi-functional strategies I found several patterns that occurred across many biological organisms.\nThe biomimetic design idea, SolDrop, is based on the concept of using several modular solar distillation \"pods,\" in a decentralized fashion, to provide a water treatment option that may be affordable for people in impoverished areas. Ideally, SolDrop solar still \"pods\" are made from recycled plastic bottles or other locally available materials that can be found and maintained locally, and used to purify water in someone's home.\nBy integrating several bio-inspired strategies and practicing the methods of biomimicry (as applied to design), I went from having an inspiration-level understanding to gaining a deep understanding of biomimicry thinking as a problem-solving framework. This led to continued 'ah-ha's' in how I might create a sustainable product innovation and a social enterprise that enriches the ecosystem with good business.\nIn retrospect, I took far more away from studying, practicing and making biomimicry thinking a part of my daily habits than I had ever anticipated. Initially I thought I'd just be tackling the product as a designer, but soon shifted to creating a water treatment option that also engages local communities and enhances local economies for long-term positive impact.\nThis article is part of a mini-series about a young industrial designer's experiences bringing a sustainability-focus to her work entitled \"Aspiring to Improve the World by Crafting a Career in Sustainable Design.\""}

We\u2019ve known for years that Republican majorities in the General Assembly and the state\u2019s congressional delegation have far exceeded the size of their actual support in a closely divided \u201cpurple\u201d state, but last night\u2019s results really brought that fact home again.\nThis was most obvious in the state\u2019s 13 congressional districts where the total vote was almost dead even, despite the presence of nine extremely well-funded Republican incumbents and one race \u2014 the third district \u2014 in which Democrats didn\u2019t even field a candidate. In the 12 contested races, the vote total thus far shows Republicans winning 1,642,344 votes or about 48.5% while Democrats won 1,747,742 or around 51.5%. Yet, despite this impressive performance, Democrats only won three of the 12 seats.\nI\u2019ve yet to add up all of the numbers, but a preliminary glance at legislative races reveals what appears to be a similar pattern: Republicans will still enjoy sizable majorities almost exclusively because of partisan gerrymandering.\nThe bottom line: Gerrymandering continue to remain a toxic and dangerous plague upon our democracy. Its elimination (and the adoption of a nonpartisan redistricting system) must remain at the top of the policy priority list for all caring and thinking people.\nWhile I agree gerrymandering is disgraceful, even gerrymandering has little effect when you have such low voter turnouts. Being retired from public service, I remember people telling me I better be registered a certain party or I probably wouldn\u2019t be hired. The older employees had lived by that system of changing their party affiliation on paper but not in actual vote. Does that affect gerrymandering?\nIt wasn\u2019t struck down by the Supreme Court. They had chances last year in Gill v. Whitford (Wisconsin) and Abbott v. Perez (Texas) but they sent Wisconsin back to the lower courts with a lamer standard (ditto North Carolina) and they just let Texas stand because they are conservative bigoted liars.

{"idx": "750", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: One of the byproducts of being around a narcissist for any significant portion of time is that you end up feeling a deep sense of self-loathing. This can be true in any category of relationship, such as intimate partner, parent-child, boss-employee, sibling, co-worker, or any other type of relationship involving an ongoing interaction with a narcissist.\nIf you are the child of a narcissist, you believe your parent(s) love you because they take care of you, right? They clean the house, take you to school, feed you dinner, and buy you clothes. You even have structure and rules to abide by. No one is hitting you or touching you in inappropriate ways. You live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. But, in spite of all of these blessings and signs of care, inside you feel a deep sense of shame. Why is this?\nAnd when you aren\u2019t experiencing all of their projected disdain, contempt, and disgust, there\u2019s always the envy to contend with. The envy isn\u2019t usually directed at you, it is usually felt toward others, those not in your narcissist\u2019s family. The narcissist is usually very envious of other people \u2013 the ones who have \u201cgood\u201d children and spouses. Your narcissist will feel very sorry for him or herself for having to deal with his or her disappointing and lousy family, believing that if only s/he had a better spouse or different children, ones that could deliver, then s/he would be happy. As you observe and experience your narcissistic loved one comparing you to others and feeling wanting, you, by implication, take on the obvious understanding that you are an inadequate failure.\nWhy do narcissists particularly enjoy the emotions of disgust, contempt, disdain, and envy? Let\u2019s dissect the former three emotions first, because they are all quite similar and projected outward in a judgmental way towards other people. Think about when you feel disgusted toward something or someone. Don\u2019t you feel that you are in the non-disgusting position, capable of welding the \u201cdisgust\u201d label outside of yourself? Don\u2019t you feel in some ways above whatever it is you don\u2019t like?\nThink about the emotions of contempt and disdain for a minute. When you feel contemptuous toward someone, on the one hand you are angry with the target of your contempt, and on the other hand you are superior to that which is contemptuous. The same applies to the emotion of disdain. When your narcissistic loved one is displaying either overtly or covertly the emotions of contempt or disdain toward you, then he or she is obviously in the one-up position, smug and superior, able to impute judgments on you, the target of the projected feelings.\nThere are probably two main reasons that narcissists so often feel these contemptuous and negative emotions. One, is because someone in their youth (probably one or both of their parents did the same thing to them) projected this emotion on to them, and, in addition, he/she (the parent) \u201cimprinted\u201d this type of behavioral expression of negative emotions onto them (monkey see, monkey do,) which they replicated in adulthood.\nThe second explanation for this type of emotional display is due to projected shame and rage. The narcissist, incapable of experiencing any depth of vulnerability, projects his/her shame and rage outwards onto certain targets in order to not have to \u201ccarry\u2019 his/her"}

She was 71 and had been suffering from cancer.\nThe feisty Salford-born writer, who drew on the gritty reality of working-class life, was one of the pioneers of the \"kitchen sink\" realism movement of the late 1950s and 1960s.\nShe was just 19 when A Taste of Honey premiered in 1958 and became an instant success, with runs in London and New York. An earthy and moving story of a teenage girl's pregnancy following a one-night stand with a black sailor, and her supportive relationship with a gay artist, it would become one of the defining feminist plays of the 1950s.\nIt was subsequently turned into a film, starring Rita Tushingham and earning Delaney and the film's director, Tony Richardson, Bafta and Writer's Guild awards for best screenplay.\nTushingham told the Guardian: \"Shelagh was such an important person at the start of my career. I am deeply saddened that we have lost such an amazing talent.\"\nJane Villiers, Delaney's agent for the last 15 years, told Channel 4: \"No word was wasted. Every word meant something. She was extraordinarily accurate about characters.\"\nThe daughter of a bus inspector of Irish descent, Delaney wrote A Taste of Honey, aged just 18, after seeing and disliking Terence Rattigan's play Variation on a Theme, partly because she felt his work showed insensitivity in the way it portrayed homosexuality.\nShe wrote it in two weeks, adapting it from a novel she was already working on. Her second play, The Lion in Love, which portrayed an impoverished family and a difficult marriage, did not enjoy the same critical success when it opened in 1960. She did not write for the theatre again until 1979, when she revised her BBC series The House that Jack Built.\nIn between she wrote screenplays: The White Bus (1965), Charlie Bubbles (1967), The Raging Moon (1970), and the screenplay for the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger, based on the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for a crime in Britain.\nDriven, in part, by rebellion against a theatre which, she claimed, did not portray \"life as the majority of ordinary people know it\", she found a vitality in Salford that infused her writing. \"The language is alive, it's virile, it lives and it breathes and you know exactly where it's coming from. Right out of the earth,\" she said in a 1960 film by Ken Russell. \"Down by the river it's even romantic, if you can stand the smell.\"\nAcknowledging her as an inspiration, the author Jeanette Winterson has said Delaney's talent had been allowed to fade because of her gender. \"She was like a lighthouse \u2013 pointing the way and warning about the rocks underneath. She was the first working-class woman playwright,\" Winterson wrote in the Guardian last year. \"She had all the talent and we let her go.\"\nThe singer Morrissey frequently referenced her writing in his lyrics, particularly in the song This Night Has Opened My Eyes, and"}

{"idx": "760", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Location-based advertising (LBA) and marketing (LBM) could be of great benefit to local merchants, though there are some things that need to happen before widescale adoption of mobile campaigns will come about. Primarily, merchants need to know why mobile campaigns are beneficial to themselves and their target market, how to measure return on investment, and have access to smartphone owners regardless of application, device, or mobile platform.\nFor years, merchants have reached local customers through local daily and weekly print publications and other traditional media channels. However, with the growing number of smartphone users and the decrease of consumer use of print and other traditional media, merchants need another way to reach their target market. In many ways, smartphones and mobile devices such as the Apple iPad are an even better way to reach local customers, offering the ability for short-term, time-sensitive, location-based offers.\nConsider that mobile advertising is expected to be $7B+ market in the next four years, with LBA potentially having a significant slice of that. TheWhereBusiness.com outlined some of the current problems hampering LBA\u2019s growth, with one of the biggest being the relative lack of smartphone users to target. Be sure to take note of their explanation outlining the difference between LBA and LBM. This post, since it focuses only on local merchants, refers to a more general grouping of mobile campaign services, say LBAM (Location-Based Advertising and Marketing), as local merchants are less likely to make a distinction between the two terms.\nSure, there are a growing number of smartphone owners out there, but how many of them are using LBS (Location-Based Services) \u2014 aka location-sharing \u2014 apps such as Foursquare, MyTown, Gowalla, and dozens of others? There are many reasons people do not use location-sharing apps, including there really being no incentive to, beyond amusement. Why would merchants want to spend money on campaigns with little or no audience? Other issues that limit merchant use of LBAM include the lack of standards for running mobile campaigns, and the means of measuring ROI.\nCreate mobile campaign bellwethers. Applying the \u201claw of least resistance\u201d that humans tend to follow means that the average merchant is not going to adopt LBAM campaigns just because they can. They need to see the value. Someone or some group has to be a bellwether and define standards and metrics, create methods of measurement, define best-practices for mobile campaigns, run some successful campaigns, and then educate and influence anyone who can help propagate these standards. Then and only then will merchants start to buy into LBAM with confidence. When merchants start to make useful offers via mobile devices that appeal to consumers, word of mouth will also help spread the reasons for consumers to use LBS apps. E.g., most merchants know what a loss-leader is, when you offer something at a loss in a sale, in hopes of selling a shopper something at a greater profit margin. If merchants knew how to do that via mobile devices, they and consumers would both benefit.\nAgnostic channels: aggregation of apps and smartphone owners. Merchants want to reach consumers. They don\u2019t care which phone, mobile platform or LBS app a consumer is using. Otherwise there\u2019s just too much fragmentation. App-specificity might be part of Location-Based Marketing, but I think it\u2019s a bad idea from a local merchant point of view. Maybe if LBS apps developers teamed up to follow some open standards, a merchant would not have to create diffferent campaigns for different LBS apps.\nConsolidate ad networks. As with"}

You can't even convince, it would appear, one third of your own caucus and that surely is disastrous.\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: Well, you're picking numbers out of the air, Chris, so I don't think you can just assume numbers here or there. But, the real issue is that we've been talking about ourselves for much too long. I think - I think we need to sort this matter out on Monday. Julia Gillard has said that if she's not successful on Monday, she'll go to the backbench. I think it's very important that we get a clear statement also from Kevin Rudd that if he should not be successful in a ballot on Monday, that he will accept that his caucus colleagues have made a decision and he will work as part of a team to get our message across, get out the fact that we've done phenomenally well coming out of the Global Financial Crisis, get out the fact that we need to keep our economy strong so that we can build a fairer society.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: But you've just seen what Robert McClelland had to say and we've heard what Bruce Hawker had to say last night. It's quite obvious that the Rudd camp believes that if it gets close enough this time, that's just the start. This could go on for months.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: What do you think it would do?\nTANYA PLIBERSEK: ... and, most importantly, what it would do to good government in this country, our ability to deliver for the people that we care about. We've got this huge agenda for the future. We've just released the Gonski Report. We want to engage with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In my own area, I've got a dental report coming out next week. We want to do better on dental health care. These are the things that matter for people.\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Certainly. And all of that would be trashed though, wouldn't it - all of that would be trashed by a continuing leadership crisis in the Labor Party and that's what's being promised.\nTANYA P"}

The singer is currently on the roster of Verve Forecast Records, a division of Universal Music Group.\nMcPhee became a household name on Season 5 of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Week by week she improved her style, but her vocals set her apart. She was definitely meant to be a singer. Her fate to win was cut short when Taylor Hicks beat her out.\nNeither Hicks nor McPhee did as well commercially as anticipated.\nI liked both of their debut CDs, but it was obvious their music wasn\u2019t as authentic as their performances on \u201cAI.\u201d I don\u2019t blame either one for that. Both are talented performers and nice people. I\u2019ve met them both.\nMcPhee\u2019s self-titled debut was good, but its sales were lackluster \u2014 not the kind of punch RCA hoped for.\nHopefully, \u201cUnbroken\u201d will change things for McPhee. Upon first listen of the new disc, it was clear to me her time spent with Foster transformed her from a girl who made a splash on TV into an amazing singer who believes in what she\u2019s doing.\n\u201cUnbroken\u201d contains 12 tracks, six co-written by McPhee, and a bonus track guaranteed to make you smile. She shares songwriting credits with such people as \"Idol\" judge Kara DioGuardi, Rachael Yamagata, Ingrid Michaelson and Paula Cole. The music is a nice blend of pop, rock and country all rolled into one \u2013 if you\u2019re a fan of crossover artists like Taylor Swift, Mandy Moore or Carrie Underwood, you\u2019ll like McPhee.\nTracks that definitely pop out and say \u201clisten to me\u201d include \u201cKeep Drivin\u2019,\u201d \u201cHad It All\u201d and \u201cSurrender.\u201d They showcase an almost different side of McPhee, a vulnerable side some would say was missing before now.\nSomething that\u2019s been there all along has been her vocal abilities. She can sing, crystal clear and very well. The song \u201cHow\u201d is amazing and should become a massive hit for McPhee. Verve Forecast would be stupid not to make this song a single. It\u2019s a \u201c10\u201d in every way: lyrics, style, vocals and presentation.\n\u201cHow\u201d is the kind of song someone like Martina McBride or Celine Dion would sing and take it to the top.

Although the U.S. Catholic bishops have convoked this gathering of Catholic leaders from across the U.S. and its territories to promote unity in proclaiming the Gospel, all the participants are there to learn from the experiences and insights of Catholic leaders in more than 300 organizations that are trying to spread the Gospel at the local level.\nJonathan Reyes, executive director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development, told the Register that the event seeks to strengthen the \u201capostolic vision\u201d of the Church by bringing its leadership together for this one-time event.\nThe idea of the convocation originated in the U.S. bishops\u2019 Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities and the Department of Justice, Peace, and Human Development and has been in the making for more than seven years, Reyes explained. However, Pope Francis\u2019 Evangelii Gaudium provided the needed push to put this plan into action.\n\u201cEvangelii Gaudium was the sort of key moment, with this sense that the Church, facing the challenges of the age, was just called to missionary discipleship, encountering Christ, and [the need] to try to do something that was never done before,\u201d he said.\nThe convocation is by invitation only. All the U.S. Catholic bishops have chosen Catholic leaders for their diocesan delegations.\nApproximately 160 out of 197 dioceses, eparchies and ordinariates are sending delegations, with an average of 10 delegates accompanying their bishop. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati is sending the most delegates, 52 persons, while the eight delegates for the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St. George\u2019s in Canton, Ohio, represent the greatest ratio of delegates proportional to flock size. With its 6,200 Catholics, that\u2019s one delegate for every 775 Catholics.\nThe USCCB also disbursed more than $500,000 in scholarships to make sure the personal and geographic diversity of the Church, along with insights and contributions, was represented, including African-American and Native-American Catholics, low-income attendees and \u201cCatholic Home Missions\u201d dioceses.\nSome attendees are coming from as far away as the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.\nThe USCCB has also invited more than 160 Catholic organizations, covering a wide variety of Catholic-led ministries, apostolates and movements, dedicated to advancing the mission of the Church, Reyes said.\nThe convocation features 66 breakout sessions, covering a wide variety of themes in the Church.

At the centre of the trade war between the two economy giants is the stealing of massive Intellectual Property (IP) of the US enterprises by the Chinese business firms and other dubious entities.\nIt is to be noted that irrespective of the current standoff between Washington and Beijing \u2014 starting from the Huawei to an incessant trade war to blocking of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the UN \u2014 US President Trump needs to be careful about the immediate consequences of falling apart with the $14trn worth Chinese economy at the moment.\nAmid claims and counter-claims by both Washington and Beijing, it is worth noting how both are veering around the IP issue and defending one another. For Trump Administration, making China listen and take necessary steps to curb sheer violations of IP rights that amounts to some good billions each year is the aim for now.\nFor President Trump, what is good for him is that a large business and political community in his country agree that China can spoil the global trading system in the long run. China\u2019s steroidal State capitalist regime poses a serious threat to the current international business system.\nBut then, China strongly refuses such claims constantly made by both the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) and the European Union of Chamber of Commerce in China (European Chamber). Last year, China\u2019s Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen publicly declared that accusations that China steals IPRs and forces technology transfers are sheer fabrications out of nothing and groundless.\nThe Xi regime has outrightly rejected US and EU allegations.\nIndeed, the Chinese Government says that it is keen on protecting IPRs and has already taken serious steps in doing so. Ironically, the AmCham China and European Chamber in their China business climate survey, ranked the IPR issue as the 12th and the 11th last year. But this has given fresh ammunition to Beijing to reclaim that if China had forced technological transfers, failed in IPR protection or even stolen IPRs, the concerned enterprises would have complained directly.\nIt has been constantly aired by the Government that in terms of IPR legislation, China has enacted adequate laws and regulations which are truly compliant to WTO directives.\nMeanwhile China has set up three IPR courts in Shanghai, Beijing and in Guanghou and special judicial branches in more than 15 cities to handle cross regional IP cases. This all is fine on official records. What makes foreign enterprises fighting IP issues see it is as a herculean task is to fight China\u2019s opaque judicial system. And moreover, all these organs are party-controlled and cases are always bias either towards the locals or state owned enterprises.\nNow the question is how the Trump Administration will wade through this crisis and find a way out wherein; first, the interests of American enterprises are served, and second, most of the European and other corporate houses are well protected from the clutches of Xi\u2019s new-found market socialism. Besides, as the presidential election fever is about to grip America, the President must bring an end to the current trade war between the US and China. Again, his team demands a robust public relations campaign to respond to the Opposition and special interest groups.\nContrary to what Xi proclaimed, he is turning all his efforts to mount a nationalist fervour so as to drum up continued support for strengthening the Communist Party at home and expansion of China\u2019s shady deals abroad.\nIt must be noted here that when"}

Kimmitt noted that economic recovery will be an important issue during U.S. Congressional hearings with Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and agreed with Ricketts that it is important for the international community to build Iraqi capacity to \"get things done on their own.\" Ricketts promised the UK embassy in Washington would follow up on next steps for the conference.\n3.(S/NF) The Paris Afghanistan conference in June should be sufficiently high-profile to attract Afghanistan President Karzai, in order, among other goals, to have him brief on Afghanistan's progress under the Compact, Secretary Kimmitt told PUS Ricketts. Ricketts said either SIPDIS Foreign Secretary Miliband or Minister Lord Mark Malloch-Brown would attend for the UK. Ricketts expressed concern that Afghanistan's political and security climate had become a more pressing issue than Iraq, and that the UK was worried about: their own military's growing role there, counter-narcotics issues, the need to increase Afghanistan's institutional capacities, and whether Karzai would win the 2009 elections. Ricketts complained that large amounts of money had been disbursed, but not used well, while additional money had been pledged by international donors, but not yet disbursed. Kimmitt stressed the need for effective development assistance.\n4.(S/NF) Ricketts described Prime Minister Brown's deep interest in stabilizing Afghanistan and using all possible multilateral tools - IMF, World Bank, NATO - to coordinate and step up their efforts. Brown is particularly interested in whether money is being effectively spent, and the need to tie assistance to reforms. Ricketts said the newly named envoy for Afghanistan Kai Eide, was a good pick, but not as effective as Paddy Ashdown would have been.\n5.(S/NF) Secretary Kimmitt noted Italy's hesitation to list Bank Melli and asked if it was a signal by Italy regarding overall Iran sanctions policy or represented LONDON 00000781 002 OF 002 Italian commercial interests with Melli. Ricketts confirmed that Italy was holding things up in the EU process, and suspected Italy was influenced by long-term commercial ties with Iran, and the desire to maintain relationships for future use. Ricketts said the UK is working to persuade Italy that Melli is a problem, and that FS Miliband was currently approaching Italy at the GAERC. Ricketts predicted the issue would not be resolved at the GAERC March 10-11, but sent to the EU Council later in the week where PM Brown would address it on"}
{"idx": "778", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Archives|Mirror, Mirror, Who Is the Unfairest?\nMirror, Mirror, Who Is the Unfairest?\nROOTING out conflicts of interest on Wall Street has become a full-time job for securities regulators in recent years. Thankfully, some long-needed changes have been made to research and sales practices at brokerage firms, banks and mutual fund companies.\nBut one conflict lives brazenly on, safe from even the most assiduous reform efforts. That enduring unfairness is related to, of all things, the fairness opinion.\nFairness opinions are produced by Wall Street banks and are intended to assure the directors of companies involved in a merger, acquisition or other deal that its terms are fair to shareholders.\nBut the opinions can be problematic. That's because the bank affirming the fairness of the transaction is often the same one that proposed the deal -- and that stands to reap millions in fees if it goes through. When J.P. Morgan Chase paid $58 billion to acquire Bank One last July, the fairness opinion was supplied by -- who else? -- J.P. Morgan Chase.\nHowever laughable they may be, fairness opinions continue to be used to justify transactions and to provide legal cover for directors fearful of being sued if a deal goes bad.\nAt least some regulators are beginning to awaken to the conflicts that fairness opinions pose. The NASD has asked its members and the public for comments on the practices surrounding the opinions and may propose new rules related to their use.\nIn Massachusetts, William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth, is investigating the fairness opinions supplied by Goldman Sachs and UBS, the two investment banks advising Gillette, which is the subject of a $57 billion offer from Procter & Gamble. Merrill Lynch provided the fairness opinion to Procter.\nMr. Galvin said he had subpoenaed documents relating to these fairness opinions out of concern that the deal might not be, well, fair to Gillette shareholders. \"For us here in Massachusetts, this is a very big deal because many of the shareholders are residents,\" he said. \"The fairness of the valuation is at issue. In the proxy statement, Goldman was credited with bringing the deal together. When one of the fairness opinion providers brought the deal together, how objective could their opinion be?\"\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. UBS's spokesman said, \"We are confident in the advisory services provided to our client.\"\nAs a part of his investigation, Mr. Galvin asked Rajesh K. Aggarwal, a professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in corporate governance and executive pay, to analyze the fairness opinions.\nProfessor Aggarwal wrote in his study that the opinions were reasonable and valid but that there were \"substantial discrepancies\" between the public and private statements the companies have made estimating the merger's value.\nFor example, the companies' public projections on the revenue and cost \"synergies\" they expected to achieve as a result of the merger were about $14 billion to $16 billion. But internal company documents, Professor Aggarwal said, put the estimates at $22.1 billion to $28.1 billion.\nIn addition, he said, there seemed to be errors in the way the merger's value synergies were calculated -- mistakes that underestimate the value of the deal. He concluded that by underestimating the value of the synergies, the deal would be more beneficial to Procter & Gamble shareholders"}

He hit the ball well. I struggled a little bit, but it wasn't just because of the timeout he took.\"\nDjokovic broke Murray twice to win four games in a row, then the Scot won a marathon game to hold for 2-4 and regained the momentum.\nOverall Murray kept Djokovic off-balance with his variety of pace and direction and thwarted his attempts to come to the net with precise passing.\nMurray's day included two second-serve aces, including one 76 mile per hour ace that flummoxed Djokovic.\n\"The majority of players now play so well from the baseline and both sides, that if you can use some slice and drop shots, some high balls and stuff, it just takes them out of their comfort zone,\" Murray said.\n\"It's my way of dictating how the match is getting played. A lot of people might not necessarily think my game looks the most aggressive or offensive, but very few times will I not have the points played how I like them to be played.\"\nMurray said he also believed he had benefitted from his improved fitness. He has an apartment in the area and did pre-season fitness training here.\n\"I think mentally it makes a difference,\" he said.\n\"Even if you're struggling, you know your opponent is going to be feeling the same. Whereas before, sometimes you could get tired and look over at the other side and the opponent seems fine.\n\"A match like today - it was hot out there. A few long rallies and I would be a little bit out of breath. I could look down the court and see him struggling, as well.\"\nMurray, the first British finalist here for 25 years, took victory when Djokovic went long with a lame volley after an hour and 42 minutes on court.\nThe 21-year-old Scotsman, who had raced through the first set with two breaks taking him to 4-0 lead, has now won three Masters titles. He was the champion in Cincinnati and Madrid in 2008.\n\"I think any time you win a tournament, obviously it gives you"}

They let go with one of their largest cheers before the game when former FSU player Burt Reynolds presented FSU trainer Don Fauls with a new Ford station wagon.\nFauls, with FSU for 28 years, is retiring.\nSo mismatched were the teams that FSU probably could have scored as many points as it wanted. The easy victory was so expected that it did little to enchance FSU's season. It did, however, keep the Seminoles in line for a bowl invitation, probably the Gator Bowl.\nTommy Gay, past president of the Gator Bowl selection committee, watched the Seminoles (8-2) on Saturday and was all but ready to give them his vote.\n\"We think they are our No. 1 choice,\" he said. \"Of course, that could change, but FSU would be a very attractive team for us.\"\nThe Gator Bowl, to be played on Dec. 30 and nationally televised by ABC, is advertising a $900,000 payoff for each team.\nThat much money is a big consideration for FSU. It needs a big payday to help wipe out a projected deficit of $1.5 million. And the proximity of the Gator Bowl, played in Jacksonville, would allow FSU to travel cheaply to the game and thus bring home more money.\nThe Seminoles' opponent would come from a list that includes the third- place finisher in the Big Ten, either Ohio State or Michigan, along with Air Force and Oklahoma State.\nBowl invitations will be extended Saturday.\nFSU, favored by some five touchdowns over Western Carolina, was superior in every category. The Catamounts had a scrappy quarterback in Kenny Edwards, but he couldn't carry the load. Edwards, constantly chased, completed nine of 24 passes for 87 yards.\n\"I'd like to have a game like this every week,\" FSU Coach Bobby Bowden said. \"It was tough to get ready, but I am just glad I was coaching our team and not on the other side coaching against us. We were playing against a team that we were much bigger and stronger than. We just ran it in the middle all night.\"\nFSU was led by tailbacks Tony Smith (13 carries, 114 yards) and Keith Ross (15-103), who scored two touchdowns. Quarterback Chip Ferguson completed seven of 18 passes for 182 yards and a touchdown. Hassan Jones caught four passes for 103 yards and a touchdown.\nThe Seminoles were merciful in that they, for the most part, chose simple, time-consuming plays.\nWestern Carolina (3-6-1) offered few challenges.\nThe Seminoles scored on their first possession when Derek Schmidt kicked a 36-yard field goal. They built a 19-0 halftime lead and coasted from there.\nFor FSU, the game was little more than a necessary chore before turning full attention to a Nov. 30 date with the University of Florida in Gainesville.\nThe Seminoles made sure they revealed no secrets Saturday.

My point was that obsessing over the copying of games is really not that interesting and misses the main point.\n... I should know better. Lesson learned. Sometimes it is truly better to say nothing at all.\nWhile the copying of ideas from games is controversial in the industry, U.S. law is very clear on this point: There is no copyright protection for games as games. Only visual or written elements of a game, like the game board or instructions, can be copyrighted.\nZynga and Electronic Arts recently agreed to drop a lawsuit over claims that The Ville copied elements of EA's Sims franchise.\nPorter did make an interesting point, which is that Zynga's skills as a company are around growing and adapting games over time to keep them fresh for users.\nThis is not the first time Porter's gotten in hot water over remarks he's made at an event.\nNot that these incidents appear to have hurt Porter.\nIn a recent consolidation of remote offices, Porter emerged as the top Zynga executive on the East Coast, absorbing employees from a second New York studio as well as some from closed studios in Baltimore and Boston.\nAnd though a drop in paying customers for Draw Something\u2014the hit mobile drawing game which prompted Zynga to buy OMGPOP\u2014has hurt Zynga's financials, the company recently celebrated Draw Something's one-year anniversary by announcing it had seen more than 100 million downloads.\nDraw Something remains an important franchise for Zynga, which has increasingly emphasized its mobile titles as traffic to its social games on Facebook has dropped."}

The wildfires have cut Canada's vast oil sands output in half.\nThe wildfire scorching through Canada's oil sands region in northeast Alberta since last Sunday night had been expected to double in size on Sunday, threatening the neighboring province of Saskatchewan.\nBut with the fire moving into its second week, light rains and cooler temperatures helped hold it back, giving officials hope that they could soon begin assessing the damage to Fort McMurray, close to where the fire started.\n\"As more and more fire has burned out around the city and the fuel around the city starts to disappear ... we are starting to move into that second phase of securing the site and assessing the site,\" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told the same media briefing.\nOfficials said it was too early to put a time line on getting people back into the town safely.\nThe broader wildfire, moving southeast through wooded areas away from the town, would still take a long time to \"clean up,\" Morrison cautioned. Officials previously warned that the fire could burn for months.\nAlberta's government estimated on Sunday that the fire had consumed 395,000 acres. That was less than a previous estimate, but authorities warned the fire would likely grow overnight.\nFort McMurray is the center of Canada's oil sands region. About half of the crude output from the sands, or 1 million barrels per day, has been taken offline, according to a Reuters estimate.\nOil prices jumped almost 2 percent in trading early on Monday, as Canada's fire contributed to tightening supply.\nThe inferno looks set to become the costliest natural disaster in Canada's history. One analyst estimated insurance losses could exceed C$9bn.\nOfficials said on Sunday the fire had done minor damage at CNOOC unit Nexen's Long Lake facility, in the site's yard. It was the first reported damage to an energy industry asset since the fire began.\nMorrison said air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers had kept the blaze from reaching a Suncor Energy facility, which Suncor identified as its base oil sands mining site north of Fort McMurray, and a Syncrude facility.\nSuncor said on Sunday it would allow employees to return to work as soon as it was safe to do so. \"We are hopeful that this will be soon,\" the company said in a statement, adding it planned to use temporary camps for employees and was arranging for workers to commute from Calgary and Edmonton."}

Husky Energy has said between 200,000 and 250,000 liters of crude oil and other material leaked into the river on Thursday from its pipeline.\nThe water supply for communities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan is threatened by an oil spill that dumped an estimated 66,000 gallons of heavy oil, along with natural gas used to dilute it, into a major river.\nThe pipeline that broke is owned by Husky Energy Inc. The site of last Thursday's leak is within 1,000 feet of the North Saskatchewan River.\nThe central Saskatchewan town of North Battleford, which gets its water from the river, shut off its river intake last week and switched to groundwater, according to Reuters.\nBy far the largest community affected so far is the city of Prince Albert, which has a population of about 35,000 people. On Monday, officials there announced they had shut down the city's water treatment plant after the oil slick arrived in town. The CBC reports the city has enough water stored to last 48 hours, and officials are urging residents to limit water use to stretch that until the end of the week, which will buy time to get a backup system running.\nManagers for the province's public works department are working to lay an 18-mile temporary water pipeline to supply the city with water from another source, the South Saskatchewan River.\nThe Globe and Mail reports authorities say they have recovered 40 percent of the spilled liquid so far.\n\"In a telephone conference with reporters, officials from the province of Saskatchewan said they had built five booms to contain the spill and were working with Husky and the federal government on a cleanup plan.\n\"Husky said the cleanup at the site of the leak had been completed, although neither it nor the province gave a time line for resolving the issue entirely.\n\"The company also said three birds had been 'impacted' by the spill and that one died.\"\nDespite the severity of the spill, and its widespread effects on people living downstream, the premier of Saskatchewan defended pipelines as the safest way to move oil over land, reported The Canadian Press wire service.\nPremier Brad Wall told the wire service, \"The facts remain that if we're not moving by a pipeline, it's going to move ... (by rail). We know that rail is actually more susceptible to spills and spills are often more intense.\"\nThe neighboring province of Alberta is considering pipeline options to bring crude oil from its tar sands to ocean ports, after a cross-border proposal that would have run through the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico was shut down by the U.S. government."}

{"idx": "797", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Variable costing affects the reported value of inventories.\nA manufacturer has two general ways to account for fixed manufacturing costs: variable costing and absorption costing. Under variable costing, you do not include fixed manufacturing costs in your calculation of the cost of each item you produce. Under absorption costing, you allocate a portion of those fixed costs to each item. Variable costing has distinct advantages for internal planning and assessment, but you can't use it for your external financial reporting.\nVariable costing clearly separates the costs that rise in tandem with production from those that remain constant. Absorption costing, on the other hand, blurs the lines. Say your company manufactures a certain product. Producing one unit requires $5 worth of raw materials, $2 in direct labor and $1 in variable manufacturing costs, such as electricity to run the machinery. Meanwhile, you have $10,000 per quarter in fixed manufacturing costs -- such things as rent or property taxes on your production facility, equipment depreciation and salaries of supervisors. Assume you produce 5,000 units in a quarter. Under variable costing, each unit produced has a reported cost of $8 (that is, $5 plus $2 plus $1). The $10,000 in fixed costs, meanwhile, is treated as a separate quarterly expense. Under absorption costing, each unit has a reported cost of $10 -- $8, plus $2 worth of the fixed cost ($10,000 / 5,000 units = $2 per unit). If you bump production up to 8,000 units, your per-unit cost remains $8 under variable costing, but falls to $9.25 under absorption costing. The consistency offered by variable costing simplifies production budgeting. This can especially benefit a small manufacturer that can't support a separate budgeting department.\nVariable costing provides a more accurate picture of your cash flow, which is critical for small manufacturers operating with tighter margins. In the previous example, imagine you manufactured 5,000 items but sold only 4,000, at $20 apiece. Under variable costing, your revenue is $80,000, the expense you report for the cost of the goods you sold is $32,000 (4,000 x $8), and you have a $10,000 expense for fixed overhead. So your manufacturing profit is $38,000, and your balance sheet shows inventory worth $8,000 (1,000 x $8). But under absorption costing, your revenue is $80,000, your cost of goods sold is $40,000 (4,000 x $10), and you have no separate expense for fixed overhead. Your manufacturing profit is $40,000, with $10,000 (1,000 x $10) on the balance sheet as inventory. An extra $2,000 has been \"parked\" on your balance sheet rather than reported as an expense, even though you've already paid that money.\nFinancial statements prepared under variable costing provide all the data needed for break-even analysis, a key tool in determining how much your company must sell at a certain price before it shows a manufacturing profit. The basic formula is: F/(P-V)=BE, where F is the fixed costs, P is the price, V is the variable costs, and BE is the necessary sales to break even. Using the data from the example, with fixed costs of $10,000 per quarter, a $"}

Violent crime peaked in the 1990s, but has steadily declined over the past 20 years. The data analyzed looks at a five-year span, from 2010 to 2014, and ranks Dubuque and Ames as the #1 and #2 cities in the U.S. where crime has plummeted the most.\nIn Dubuque, the five-year decrease in violent crime is 58 percent; Ames boasts a 56 percent drop in violent crime over that same five-year period. Officials with the Ames Police Department say having a low violent crime rate has helped officers focus energy on proactive measures to keep it that way.\n\"One of the tenants we have here at the police department is problem solving and relationship building,\" said Commander Jason Tuttle with Ames PD. \"And so, when we can do that, and we have the time to do that, we can get into the neighborhoods, work with some of the community leaders, work with some of the neighborhood association leaders on trying to solve specific problems in our neighborhoods. And when we do that, we're working side by side with them to work through those issues, rather than policing over them and having more of a confrontational relationship with those citizens.\"\nThere was only one homicide reported in Ames in the five-year span of the study, with zero homicides from 2012-2014. Police say the study doesn't include 2015 data, where the city had just one homicide - classified as \"justifiable\" due to self-defense.\n\"I've lived here for 30 years in the same neighborhood, and generally I would say I've never had the perception that violent crime was ever a problem,\" said Debbie Lee, leader of the Oak to Riverside Neighborhood Association in Ames.\nLee credits the police department for being proactive, by forming close relationships with the city's neighborhood associations.\n\"Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum, and I would really credit - Ames has been fortunate to have an exceptional police chief who has been willing to be creative and try different approaches,\" Lee said.\nThose different approaches include training landlords to keep crime out of their apartments, meeting with students every fall at Iowa State University, and providing resource officers to neighborhoods.\n\"I credit this very much to the leadership in the police department, that has - on the area of violent crime, on the area of mental health, on the area of alcohol abuse, on the areas of racial relations - been working very hard on being a proactive rather than a reactive situation,\" said Ames Mayor Ann Campbell.\nComm. Tuttle says it's a cycle: if you have a low violent crime rate, you can focus your energy on preventative measures to keep it that way.\n\"We don't pay a great amount of attention to these reports because we're working daily to build those relationships, and educate people in our community on how to have those safe neighborhoods,\" he said.\nWhile violent crime is down in Ames - and especially in the category of homicides - it should be noted Ames' sexual assault rate was higher in the study's span than"}

Smith and Jones apparently spoke to Fedora, but the coach says Green wrote his message because he was unable to speak due to his injuries.\nNo arrests have been made and police have not released any possible suspects; however, Hattiesburg police spokesman Sgt. Allen Murray said the shooting was possibly gang related.\n\"We will do all we can to assist these young men and their families, as well as assist the Hattiesburg Police Department in its investigation of this event,\" said University of Southern Mississippi President Martha Saunders, according to CBS affiliate WJTV.\nSmith, a fifth-year senior interdisciplinary studies major, was the team's starting middle linebacker before a season-ending knee injury last month. Jones, a junior from Bastrop, La., has started all 10 games on the defensive line, making 26 tackles this season. Green has made four tackles in the seven games he has played this season and he too is a junior interdisciplinary studies major.\n\"During this difficult time our thoughts and prayers are with these three members of our Southern Miss family, Martez, Tim and Deddrick, as well as their families,\" Fedora said in a statement released by the school. \"These three men are an integral part of the success of our football program and we will continue to keep them in our hearts and hope for a speedy recovery.\"\nIndividuals with information are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 601.582.STOP or 601.582.7867.

For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome \u2014 and yet each is \u201creading\u201d a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development. An increasing body of data suggests this is accomplished by modifying the genome both in the nature of the proteins bound to different sequences and in the spatial organization of those sequences relative to each other. The spatial organization or folding of the genome may be particularly important in complex multicellular organisms, since many of the sequences known to interact based on genetic data are nonetheless substantially separated from each other along the linear genome. By regulating the folding of this linear sequence into a higher order structure, a cell might change which regulatory sequences have access to which genes, and achieve different behavioral states.\nSo far we have little imaging data on how the genome is folded within a cell on the length scale of individual genes, or whether this folding is regulated in any way relevant to the behavior of the cell. Our limited knowledge stems largely from want of a method that has both the resolution and specificity to visualize such genomic substructure. Conventional fluorescent microscopy has developed excellent tools for coloring specific regions of DNA and particular DNA-associated proteins with uniquely colored dyes \u2014 but lacks the resolution to turn these colored blurs into structures. Electron-microscopy has substantially greater resolution but lacks compatibility with specific labeling techniques to tell different gene clusters or different protein types apart. Super-resolution imaging approaches promise to address this balance by allowing the use of fluorescent labels while simultaneously resolving structures on the nano-scale. I have been adapting this approach to uncover the nano-scale structure of chromatin and determine to how this structure changes when bound by different types of nuclear proteins. While individual gene clusters appear as quite diverse structures, there appear to be a few general features, for example, linking structure with the epigenetic state.\nOligoSTORM and OligoDNA-PAINT meld the Oligopaint technology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with, respectively, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) and DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) to enable in situ single-molecule super-resolution imaging of nucleic acids. Both strategies enable \u226420 nm resolution and are appropriate for imaging nanoscale features of the genomes of a wide range of species, including human, mouse, and fruit fly (Drosophila)."}

It certainly does, according to Labdoor, a four-year-old, South San Francisco-based startup that tests about 50 supplements and energy drinks each month that it buys off retail shelves, then ranks for consumers.\nWhat it finds might intrigue you. Vitamin C degrades in water, for example, so any water-based Vitamin C tablets are basically worthless. More than a quarter of fish oil products are rancid on the shelves, even when their expiration date may be two years out. Many protein powders don\u2019t live up to their claims, either. Some are largely composed of amino acids rather than the 100 percent whey protein isolate advertised on the label. Others contain so much sodium that consumers confuse bloating for muscle mass.\nWhy are these things allowed? FDA loopholes, says Labdoor founder and CEO Neil Thanedar, who says that in the case of protein powders, for example, manufacturers need only test the nitrogen content of their product. And to a nitrogen test, amino acids and why protein isolate look the same.\nThanedar, who studied chemistry and molecular biology at the University of Michigan, seems almost destined to be taking on the $36 billion-dollar-per-year supplements industry. He says his father, Shri, ran testing labs his entire life, and he was intrigued from a young age in the science behind the labs. In fact, though his father had retired by the time Thanedar was graduating from college, he pulled him back into the business. \u201cI decided I wanted to start a lab instead of get a job, so I kind of wrangled him in and we ran it together for three years and now he runs that lab independently\u201d in Michigan, says Thanedar.\nWhile lucrative, Thanedar saw an opportunity to cater to customers and let them know what, exactly, it is that they\u2019re ingesting.\nWhat they see is a big opportunity beyond affiliate marketing, which is how Labdoor has been making money until recently.\nNow, in addition to sending visitors to Amazon to buy that top-rated multivitamin (and sending Amazon a healthy percentage of its revenue), Labdoor has begun experimenting with direct sales, fulfilling orders itself or else sending them directly to the products\u2019 manufacturers, which it aims to do more of.\n\u201cPart of the issue is routine quality control.

The Bermuda Sun spoke to Kaissa managing director Charles Dunstan about what a roof warranty entails.\nWhat is a roof warranty?\nAs with certain other elements of construction, a roofing system is deemed of such critical importance to the long-term life cycle of a building that it requires extra assurance of correct construction and installation.\nOrdinarily, this risk is assumed by the building insurer but, more and more, the installer and the roofing system manufacturer are taking on this risk as a sign of their commitment to excellence in the design, manufacture and execution of the roof system installation.\nEssentially, a warranty is another form of insurance, the cost of which is paid for at the time of installation.\nManufacturers pass this risk on to their insurers. For this reason, it is insurance companies that have driven the industry forward in improved specifications and quality control.\nFactory Mutual Insurance is one such leader in property insurance.\nFM\u2019s business approach is centered on the belief that property losses can be prevented or mitigated.\nFM Global engineering personnel regularly visit insured locations to evaluate hazards and recommend improvements to their property or work practices to reduce physical and financial risks if a loss occurs.\nThey have taken the initiative in testing and approval of a wide range of building elements, including in depth testing of roof systems.\nIn North America, their Roofnav system is a recognized source for approved roof system ratings.\nSimilarly, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) issue standards for engineering performance for various building elements, such as roofs.\nThese are published for use by architects and specifiers in design of the appropriate roof for a property development.\nWhat types of roof warranties are available?\nThey can also vary in coverage. Some are simply material warranties, covering only the material to last for its stated life cycle or at least warranty period.\nSome are labour warranties, backing up the installation for a stated period of time, usually no more than five years.\nOr there are full system warranties, which cover both material and installation for a stated period.\nWhat doesn\u2019t a warranty cover?\nIn a material only warranty, the installation labour is excluded. If the roof material fails, the owners recourse is limited to replacement of the cost of material only.\nIn a labour warranty, the material cost may be excluded.\nA full system warranty may have various limits declared within its terms that the consumer should examine and be aware of.\nFor example, each roof project should have performance requirements outlined in the specification documents that are tied to one of the rating systems mentioned above, such as FM or ASCE.\nThere will be certain parameters on the performance of the roof pertaining to wind uplift, vapour permeance and thermal resistance.\nThese performance requirements have to be clearly identified and quantified at the outset in order to qualify for coverage.\nThere are limits on all elements of risk.\nWind uplift coverage will be limited to 120mph of wind speed.\nWarranty coverage will exclude damage from wind blown debris.\nAt one time exclusions often made reference to the general phrase \u201cActs of God\u201d.\nLately this generality has been replaced by more specific terms and requirements, as the insurers tighten up their risk exposure.\nWhy are roof warranties important?\nFollowing significant storm damages, much investigation and research goes into determining what factors led to the demise of a failed roof system.\nFrom this research, new"}

The fight against discrimination in the state of Arizona just got nine.\nSometime before noon Tuesday, nine activists entwined their bodies in a thick steel chain, locking themselves to the doors of the Arizona Capitol in protest against the recently passed Senate Bill 1070, a bill that would open the door to racial profiling in the Grand Canyon state and force all law enforcement officers with \"reasonable suspicion\" to inquire about the immigration status of those they stop.\nIn a statement, the nine activists said they chained themselves to the doors \"because nothing else has worked. ... Our purpose is to expose Arizona's apartheid legislation, and to uphold our dignity and human rights.\"\nIf the use of the word apartheid seems extreme to the uninitiated, all I can say is that you have to know this bill, and this state, to understand that it is, unfortunately, all too correct. Brewer should veto this dangerous, abhorrent and costly measure.\nThe new legislation, which was written by state Sen. Russell Pearce, resembles the dictates of an authoritarian government. It would presume all those stopped by police to be immigrants unlawfully present in the United States unless they are carrying one of several forms of federal or state ID. Even citizens could be held if they do not have their papers on them.\nThose here illegally would be turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

It's sometimes referred to as \"Abraham Lincoln disease\" because victims tend to be unusually tall and lanky-limbed, but it can have other, potentially deadly symptoms, including defects of the heart valves and aorta. \"She went though many surgeries and spent a lot of time in hospitals,\" says Falco. \"But they didn't really know what to do. They didn't give much hope. We just went through hell.\"\nThose years of hardship as he and his wife of 38 years, Susan, struggled with a special-needs child left a powerful imprint on the TV executive. So, when he signed on as CEO of Univision in 2011 -- after 31 years at NBC, rising to network president in 1993 -- he decided to take a look at how the No. 1 Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S. handled its philanthropic programs. \"It's so impor\u00adtant for people to know that there are other people who actually care,\" he says. One of the first things he did at his new job was make sure Univision was reaching out as smartly as it possibly could.\nThe company already had numerous philanthropic programs in place, but Falco, 61, found them too scattered to be of maximum benefit, so he decided to give the network a more narrowly defined mission. \"Rather than try to do a hundred different things, I tried to focus on four things that I thought were really important in providing service to the community,\" he says. Those four were education, health care, prosperity (promoting financial literacy) and civic participation, which Falco gathered under an umbrella program called Univision Contigo (or Univision With You).\nSince the new initiative began in 2013, it has launched innovative programs like the Univision Farmacia discount, which has helped 1.9 million participants save an estimated $32 million with prepaid cards that can be used at local pharmacies. It also is teaming with Steve Jobs' widow, Laurene, for an early education program in Silicon Valley and with The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation for an early reading program for underprivileged children called Too Small to Fail.\n\"Kids,\" says Falco, \"are the great common denominator among all cultures.

After five-and-a-half months of back-to-backs, TNT Thursday nights and countless hours debating who's better and who's best, it's finally time to let the players and coaches decide a true champion.\nTo be sure, you'll hear no complaints from me about the season that was. The 2014-15 campaign was arguably the most exciting and intriguing one the Association has seen in some time. From the rise of the Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks to the depth of competition out West to the scramble to fill out the Eastern Conference bracket, there was nary a dull moment from start to finish in the league's schedule.\nThat being the case, it might seem like a tall order for the playoffs to live up to the regular season that just transpired. But without a clear-cut favorite to take home the Larry O'Brien Trophy, this postseason is shaping up to be every bit as captivating as the slate that preceded it, if not more so.\nBefore we get wrapped up in all the best-of-seven series to come, let's look back to see how the NBA as a whole finished up by ranking each of the 30 teams based on how they played down the stretch and which players they had available.\nAnother year, another sad slate of basketball for the Minnesota Timberwolves. An incessant spate of injuries\u2014from Kevin Martin's wrist to Kevin Garnett's knee to Shabazz Muhammad's finger to the ankles of Ricky Rubio and Nikola Pekovic and beyond\u2014doomed the Wolves to their 11th straight trip to the lottery from start to finish in 2014-15.\nLaVine might (eventually) be one of those teammates. The UCLA product nearly averaged 19 points, five rebounds and five assists while shooting better than 40 percent from three over his final 18 games (17 starts).\nThe Wolves can look forward to a summer marked by growth from their youngsters, rather than one consumed by the inevitable ouster of an anxious franchise cornerstone. That, in itself, could be enough to ignite a productive offseason in Minnesota, along with whatever the team yields from its latest lottery pick.\nAnd if the Wolves can exterminate their infestation of injury bugs before October, they just might make something meaningful of 2015-16.\nNerlens Noel won't likely wind up as the NBA's Rookie of the Year, but unlike last year's winner (Michael Carter-Williams), the Kentucky product can probably count on a long-term future with the Philadelphia 76ers.\nNoel did plenty to make up for lost time after missing what would have been his maiden campaign in 2013-14 while recovering from a torn ACL. He led all rookies in double-doubles and was the only player in the league to finish in the top 10 in both steals and blocks, all while missing a mere six of his team's 82 games.\nEach game, eight Sixers staffers would track different metrics, including shot contests, hustle plays and how quickly players attacked different areas after an offensive miss and filled sections of the court defending in transition.

{"idx": "833", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Why unemployment in IT sector is on rise?\nIn January 2015, Tata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest software services firm, fired approximately 25,000 software engineers. This event inaugurated a new trend in India\u2019s globally-connected IT industry. In 2017, growing layoffs finally sparked a national debate. News reports and interviews with IT employees confirm that leading companies, that only a few years ago were aggressively recruiting new employees, are not only hiring in relatively small numbers but are actively pushing employees out.\nA drop in the hiring rates will affect the tens of thousands of engineering graduates who aspire to enter the IT workforce as they encounter firms that are reluctant to hire in the volumes of the preceding two decades. The claims and findings presented below are based on ongoing research that commenced in 2014 and relies on over 100 in-depth interviews.\nDownsizing is not temporary The era of labour-intensive growth in IT is over and job creation will occur at a decelerated pace. The expansion of India\u2019s IT sector has depended on the IT investments that large American and European companies make into their own IT systems. Quantitative and qualitative shifts in the \u201cIT spend\u201d of client corporations instantly affect the firms to which IT development and maintenance tasks are subcontracted.\nSimplifications in the way enterprises organise, develop and maintain their IT infrastructure implies an erosion of back-office IT work that typically has been offshored. Cloud computing centralises IT infrastructure and enables companies to share computing resources. Secondly, new software programmes automate certain labour-intensive tasks such as software testing and IT helpdesk functions. Restructuring contributing to job losses New employees (1-5 years of experience) do not receive the quick promotions and salary hikes that have defined the IT industry.\nHowever, their jobs are (relatively) protected by the fact that to the firm they represent cheap labour at the bottom of the pyramid. Mid-career professionals who joined the industry roughly in the 2000-2010 period bear the brunt of the cost-cutting drive that grips today\u2019s firms. Despite the industry\u2019s attempt to cast the irrelevance of the middle managers as an issue of skill-deficiency, the fact is that middle managers are expensive in the eyes of the company.\nmaking project requirements ever-changing. Many interviewees discussed the dual pressure they face from their clients as well as their own managers (who themselves are at risk of losing jobs). The pressure, they say, to produce \u2018more from less\u2019 has never been greater. New areas are not labour-intensive. The boom in technology-intensive start-ups (both consumer and business facing) has opened up a new area of employment for an educated, upwardly mobile, young workforce, particularly for highly-skilled software engineers \u2013 but also recruits for sales, marketing and product management divisions.\nLarge IT companies are also looking to make specialised, targeted hires, particularly in areas like cloud security and data analytics. With the erosion of labour-intensive tasks of software testing, integration and maintenance, hiring will always be modest compared to the \u2018golden years\u2019 of expansion. Start-ups are of course much smaller (in terms of employees) and aim for high labour productivity (revenue per employee). Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that this is a volatile sector, fueled by venture capital and business models that privilege sales and user growth over profitability and therefore we can presume that many fledgling companies will fail, merge or be acquired."}

The newspaper changed its approach to the region with more balanced reporting. Tel Aviv ceased to be incorrectly identified as the capital of Israel and articles from the Middle East began to include viewpoints from both sides of the conflict.\nOver the past year, however, El Pa\u00eds has drifted back to its previous pattern, disregarding the voice of one of the parties in the conflict.\nIt is now rare to see the perspectives of any Israeli who does not sharply condemn his or her own country in the newspaper. For example, for the 49th anniversary of the \u201coccupation,\u201d El Pa\u00eds published a series of articles, graphics and photographs over the course of a month that were authored by the paper\u2019s correspondent, as well as other envoys to the area. Because these were not time-sensitive, breaking news stories, journalists had the opportunity to contextualize and delve into the background of the conflict. Yet none of the articles included a single voice explaining the situation from an Israeli viewpoint.\nThe day after an Israeli 13 years old girl was assassinated, El Pa\u00eds dedicated its front page to the \u201cRavages of the Occupation\u201d.\nWith the death of Hallel, there are already 33 Israelis killed in the wave of violence that began last October and which also killed two Americans, an Eritrean immigrant \u2013 lynched in Beer Sheba, having been mistaken for an assailant \u2013 and about 220 Palestinians.\nThe newspaper gives no indication that most of the 220 Palestinians were attackers.\nWhen the newspaper does include an Israeli viewpoint in its reports, it is generally in the form of a press release or an official statement. This is entirely different from the frequent first-person testimonies and interviews with Palestinians or organizations representing them.\nAn exception to this is the newspaper\u2019s citing of Israeli organizations that focus on attacking their own country. For example, Breaking The Silence, an Israeli-based NGO whose mission is to \u201cexpose\u201d alleged war crimes by Israeli soldiers, invited journalists and executives from El Pa\u00eds to visit the area, guided by the organization\u2019s ideologically- biased point of view. This organization\u2019s voice became a prominent one in the newspaper\u2019s reports \u2013mentioned in about twenty articles published in the last two years.

We should be trying to maintain the historical venues that we have in the City of Newark, as opposed to let them deteriorate and become inactive,\" said Philip S. Thomas, executive director of the Newark Performing Arts Corp.\nOn Saturday, the public is invited to help the city, which owns the building, and the hall's operators design the venue's future at a daylong conference billed as \"Newark Symphony Hall Reimagined.\"\nNewark Mayor Cory Booker, who spurred symphony hall's renewal, said people have an interest in preserving the building that was once a gem in the city's downtown.\n\"That facility has a very strong hold on the spirit and the imagination of a lot of residents here, and many residents have great stories about seeing shows and concerts or just going to events there as well,\" Booker said.\nDespite the recession, City Council President Mildred Crump said she is confident the campaign to raise funds will be a success.\n\"Mindful of the fact that these are very difficult times, there are still people out there who were around when Newark Symphony Hall was where you went,\" said Crump, who serves on hall's board of directors.\nThe building, also known as the Mosque and originally built by the Shriners as a Masonic Temple in 1925, had been the state's premier venue for a variety of famed entertainers and theater groups. Marian Anderson, William Warfield, George Gershwin, Tony Bennett and Patti LaBelle were among the major stars whose names went up on the marquee.\nThe New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Ballet, New Jersey State Opera and African Globe Theater also have used the building.

With increasing competition from other area venues, fewer groups rented the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall, Terrace Ballroom and a second-floor theater.\nTenants who leased office space on the third and fourth floors also departed when water damage from a leaking roof made the spaces uninhabitable.\nOver the years, periodic repair work was done, but it wasn't enough, Thomas said.\n\"If"}

Political officials at many different levels of government have come to rely on them as representing their constituents' preferences on current issues. However, research indicates surveys may have shortcomings which can affect valued democratic qualities (equality, for one). This brings into question their ability to accurately represent the public view. Many United States citizens do not feel that they can affect government actions. Voting is the citizen's domain, often after the candidates have been chosen.\nPolitical scientists have recognized and bemoaned the voter ignorance and apathy displayed prominently in survey research, but have for the most part ignored the causes. While they admit the shortcomings of surveys, they have not evaluated their use by politicians or attempted to measure surveys' effects relative to conceptions of democratic ideals within the broader society.\nThis thesis does not seek to establish our dependence on surveys as the origin of voter apathy; there are many contributing factors to political culture. It is the intention of this thesis to examine the shortcomings of surveys, how they are used, and the ways in which they result in undemocratic effects. A proposed plan for change is then introduced with the hope that it can remedy some of these ills.\nKagan, Nancy H., \"An Evaluation of Political Surveys and Their Consequences for Democracy\" (2009).

In the speech, the president spoke of her to make his point that it was unfair for a billionaire's secretary to pay a higher tax rate than her boss.\nAlso in the first lady's box last year was former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot in 2011 along with 18 others in Tucson. When Obama entered the House chamber, he stopped to give Giffords a hug, which was met by a standing ovation. Up-and-coming Democrat Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, also got an invite last year.\nSo, in a year when the president is likely to highlight legislative priorities such as gun control, immigration reform, and \"balanced\" deficit reduction, who will end up on the White House guest list? Newtown families? The latest recipient of the Medal of Honor? An undocumented worker?\nThat's where you, the readers, come in.

But when it comes to our zoning, subdivision and planning laws, our state is still stuck a half century behind the curve.\nYet that could change. There is a growing movement to reform the state\u2019s antiquated and confusing laws that govern development. We aim to create a more predictable set of rules that will encourage good planning and good projects so that our cities and towns can enjoy the kinds of walkable, vibrant places where people want to live and work. To be successful, we need to pass legislation pending on Beacon Hill that will simplify the zoning process for the benefit of municipalities, residents, and property owners across MetroWest and throughout the Commonwealth.\nCurrent laws do not promote development that meets the needs of Massachusetts residents in 2013, much less in the years to come. We\u2019re building fewer than half of the homes needed to house current residents, and we\u2019re often building in ways that don\u2019t use our land and resources responsibly. It\u2019s time for some common sense that works in everyone\u2019s interests.\nKnown as House Bill 1859 or \u201cAn Act Promoting the Planning and Development of Sustainable Communities,\u201d our reform package has earned 58 co-sponsors since being introduced, including Sen. James Eldridge (D-Acton).\nThe proposal will make it quicker and cheaper for communities to decide where to sensibly grow by making master planning optional and more flexible. It encourages communities to establish districts for prompt permitting of housing and commercial growth while adopting environmental protections. With our proposal, the permitting process would become more rational for developers and the community. Instead of navigating a gamut of local boards individually, developers of major projects could submit a common application to all boards simultaneously and be granted a joint public hearing within 45 days of filing.\nLet\u2019s take development fights out of the courts. This bill brings our zoning law into the 21st century and clarifies many gray areas of the law so that everyone understands what they mean. A few examples include: inclusionary zoning to encourage affordable housing, impact fees to help offset the costs of development, and form-based codes that promote good design. Furthermore, we eliminate several loopholes that make it possible for developers or municipalities to game the system. Our legislation would create reasonable and standardized zoning protections once a building permit, special permit, or subdivision plan is approved. In the event of a disagreement on land use proposals, there will be an opportunity for a neutral facilitator to come in and settle the dispute instead of enduring costly and time-consuming court battles. The appeal process is streamlined to save everyone time and money.\nOur antiquated zoning laws hurt our environment as well. Every day in Massachusetts, 22 acres of forest and farmland are converted primarily to low-density residential sprawl. This is due in part to \u201cApproval Not Required\u201d (ANR) development, which is almost unregulated. We are the only state in the nation that allows this. Our reform proposal would enable a city or town to replace that ANR with an expedited review process to minimize haphazard development and preserve important landscapes in our communities. There are also provisions to encourage the sensitive placement of development as well as recharge our aquifers to reduce flooding.\nOne of Massachusetts\u2019 greatest strengths is the diversity of its cities and towns. There are dense urban areas like Somerville, seaside communities like Gloucester, and rural towns like Brimfield. Under these proposed new laws, MetroWest communities and cities and"}

Giolitto, architect with Northeast Collaborative Architects, which is based in Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nThe new Station 2 will be constructed on property adjacent to the existing West Brattleboro fire station. The existing station is undersized, and renovating and expanding it would have required the costly relocation of a sewer tank and emergency generators.\nAccording to Giolitto and Horton, the oversight committee has not decided whether to demolish the outdated West Brattleboro station or to put the building to new use. The exiting station will continue to house firefighters during construction.\nBuilding a new Station 2 will save the project about $200,000.\nNancy Miller questioned whether having a station in West Brattleboro was prudent given the town\u2019s tight finances.\n\u201cI have serious reservations whether we can afford all three sites,\u201d said Miller.\nHorton answered that before construction starts, the town will obtain from the contractor a guaranteed maximum price to help keep the project within budget.\nEarly plans for the Police Department renovations included renovations and expansion of the existing stone foundation of Municipal Center to the tune of $150,000 to $200,000, explained Horton.\n\u201cPeople think basements are cheap, but they\u2019re not,\u201d said Horton.\nPhillips told the audience that the committee charged Interim Town Manager Patrick Moreland and Horton with evaluating alternative sites for the police station.\nAll the alternative sites proved more expensive than keeping the police station at the Municipal Center, said Phillips.\nGiolitto and Horton also took questions on how the police station addition will affect the Municipal Center\u2019s parking lot.\nThe town anticipates approximately 40 parking spaces, said Giolitto.

{"idx": "868", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Why is Vectren pushing for an expensive, unnecessary plan that will harm its customers?\nAs an engineer who works at an energy company and a father, I think a lot about the cost of energy. It\u2019s a subject that\u2019s particularly important to me as a lifelong resident of Southern Indiana, where our electric utility, Vectren, has forced consumers to pay the highest electricity rates anywhere in the Midwest \u2014 and is now putting forward a plan that would drive those rates even higher.\nWhile Vectren proudly points to essentially flat rates since 2011, those rates are still nearly 40% higher than the Indiana average. Since 2011, Vectren rates have been stable at approximately 15.5 cents/kilowatt-hour. But the average rate for the state of Indiana is 11.31 and was even lower in the past. In fact, Vectren rates are nearly 3 times those charged just across the river in Henderson, Kentucky and 30% higher than Indianapolis Power & Light.\nEnergy powers every part of our lives so high electricity costs have a negative impact on virtually everything we do. Residents in Vectren\u2019s area of coverage who are on a fixed income struggle more than those in areas with more reasonable rates. Businesses are less likely to locate in this area. People are less likely to move here. Property values are lower.\nNow, Vectren is pushing for a plan that would make our electricity prices even higher. It wants to shut down existing generating facilities in order to build a billion dollar natural gas fueled power plant with more capacity.\nIn a time when demand has flattened, excess capacity is not needed. Moreover, Vectren is proposing additional capacity in the form of solar. Of course, solar energy is only available on sunny days and can\u2019t be turned on and off as demand changes. All of this may be great for Vectren\u2019s public image but it's an additional, unnecessary drain on their rate payers.\nVectren management has admitted that the result of all these expenditures will be even higher rates. And what will rates be if natural gas prices spike again as they did in 2008?\nWhy is Vectren pushing for an expensive, unnecessary plan that will harm its customers? Being a for-profit monopoly, Vectren\u2019s profits are regulated. The one and only way that utilities like Vectren can increase total profits is through capital expenditures that are passed on to customers in higher rates. Smart meters? You pay for them. Solar farms? You pay for them. Oversized generating facilities? That\u2019s right, you pay for them.\nIt\u2019s time for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to demand that Vectren stop placing profits above its obligation to provide customers with affordable and reliable energy, and reject Vectren\u2019s plan to raise our electric bills."}

While the precise timing of this event was uncertain, the move itself was inevitable given the steady expansion of the now-Crown Prince\u2019s domestic and international portfolio and his role in spearheading the Kingdom\u2019s push toward economic diversification, reform, and answering President Trump\u2019s call for U.S. allies to play a more proactive role in providing for their own security and defense.\nThe transition, occurring under the auspices of King Salman who is, perhaps, the last of the sons of the Kingdom\u2019s founder, King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, with the prestige, stature, and influence to adeptly orchestrate such a significant move, was executed quickly, smoothly, and elegantly and, most importantly, with the strong backing of the Royal Family and the influential clerical establishment. Significantly, former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had been next-in-line to the throne, quickly and publicly swore baya\u2019a (the oath of allegiance) to Prince Mohammed, a symbolic but significant gesture given by members of the Royal Family and key pillars of Saudi society to signify their support for a new leader.\nThe designation of Mohammed bin Salman as Crown Prince eliminates uncertainty over who would succeed the 81-year-old King Salman.

It is also the clearest indicator that the ongoing generational transfer of power within the Kingdom is permanent. Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s youth and charisma have made him a popular figure in a country where the median age is approximately twenty-seven.\nIt is also a clear win for the United States. Prince Mohammed is very pro-American and places a premium on the military and security relations \u2013 economic and trade relations as well \u2013 the two countries enjoy. Following the election, he moved quickly to forge a close connection with the Trump administration; the president\u2019s decision to travel to Riyadh for his first overseas visit happened, in large measure, thanks to the success of Prince Mohammed\u2019s outreach to the White House.\nThe burgeoning relationship between President Trump and the Crown Prince has helped initiate a reset of U.S.-Saudi relations, which had reached a nadir under the Obama administration.

There's sport, and there's utility, in equal measure.\nAs a five-passenger vehicle, a lot of customers who need a third-row seat pass the Touareg by, but for the rest of us, there's an adequate 31 cubic feet of cargo space, which turns into 71 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down. Inside, the Touareg is roomy up front, reasonably spacious for two rear-seat passengers. Instruments and controls are among best in class, and the upholstery and trim has a genuinely premium look and feel.\nIt should because the Touareg isn't, and has never been, cheap. Starting at more than $40,000, our test model topped $53,010, and it didn't have all the available options. One option it did have that raised the price about $3,500: The 3.0-liter, 225-horsepower turbocharged diesel engine.\nDiesels typically cost more to build and almost always get better mileage than gasoline-powered engines, but with the added cost plus the fact that diesel seems to average about 40 to 50 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline, a lot of Touareg customers might stick with the standard 3.6-liter, 280-horsepower gas engine.\nThat said, the diesel does get better mileage \u2014 the EPA rates it at 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, while the gasoline engine is rated at 14 mpg city, 19 mpg highway. We averaged nearly 23 mpg in the diesel Touareg, which seems pretty good for a vehicle that weighs 5,304 pounds.\nReally, though, the Touareg is startlingly light on its feet. Handling is typically German, which means precise and controlled, but the ride is smooth, even on uneven surfaces. Where the Touareg has always surprised is off-road. Though it's not a dedicated rock-crawler, the Touareg can take on all but the worst terrain. It has low-range gearing for extra power, and the torque supplied by the diesel engine make it pull like a freight train. It's limited by the tires, though, which are understandably more designed for a quiet highway ride than mud-bogging. The Touareg can also tow more than 7,700 pounds, a lot for a vehicle this size.\nWhile the base-model Touareg has a lot of standard equipment, our tester had a $2,600 luxury package, a $5,200 technology package and a $500 tow hitch that, with shipping, upped the price to $53,010. A lot of those features I could happily do without, especially with so much equipment standard, including a power sunroof, Sirius satellite radio and walnut interior trim. All the safety equipment you'd suspect is standard, too.\nVolkswagen is updating the Tou"}

Finished off with a cloth ribbon handle, it's the perfect place to rest Easter treats and eggs decorated with natural dyes.\nIf you decide to create a ribbon handle, you'll need to drill holes in to the terra-cotta. Wearing safety goggles, drill two holes, one on each side of the pot, about 1/2 inch from the edge of the rim. As you drill, use light pressure to prevent the pot from cracking. Dust away powder.\nCover the inside of the pot with two to three coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant. While it dries, apply two to three coats of acrylic or latex base paint to the outside of the pot and the 2-inch lip inside the pot.\nThere are a variety of painting techniques to use when designing your basket. Regardless of the technique used, apply a few coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant over your finished design and allow to dry overnight before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace shard or gravel at the bottom of the pot and over the hole to allow for water drainage. Fill soil just up to 2 inches below top and work in a small amount of fertilizer. Sprinkle seeds onto soil, rake seeds with fork, and water with a spray bottle. Use this watering method until seeds sprout and roots are established. Place in a window and water every couple of days, keeping the top of the soil moist at all times. Once the roots have been established, adjust the watering schedule to once or twice a week. Growing time for grass is around four to five weeks.\nThe sun will fade the ribbon and possibly your painted design, so attach the ribbon after the grass has grown and protect the design by wrapping it with cloth. To attach ribbon, cut along the edge forming a needle. Insert ribbon into the first hole; bring enough through to tie a large knot at the end.\nRepeat the process on the other side of the pot. Adjust ribbon as needed. On larger, heavier pots ribbon is only ornamental. If unsure about using the ribbon as a handle, carry the basket from the bottom.\nTo ensure your sweet treats stay that way, don't water the basket the day before you'll use it because the grass and soil will retain moisture. For added protection, wrap candy and food in cellophane bags.\nSeveral fruits, vegetables and spices can create natural dyes. There are two methods for dyeing eggs: boiling raw eggs with dye agent (hot) or dipping hard-boiled eggs in cold or room-temperature dye (cold). Each approach will yield different results.\nHot boiling method: To create dye, use 2 tablespoons of white vinegar per quart of water, add dye ingredients and bring to a boil. To remove ingredients, strain solution into bowl and return solution to pan. Place eggs in pot; add additional water to cover. Bring dye solution and raw eggs back to a full boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Leave in pot longer for darker colors. Use spoon to remove eggs from solution, rinse with lukewarm water and allow to dry. Alternatively, you can boil the ingredients and the raw eggs simultaneously. Hot-dyed eggs are purely decorative and should not be eaten.\nCold dipping method: Boil eggs and dye ingredients separately. Cool"}

{"idx": "889", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In mid-October 2008, even as the Reserve Bank was dousing the system with rupee and forex liquidity, Finance Minister (P) Chidambaram had suo moto constituted a committee on liquidity management, with Finance Secretary Arun Ramanathan as the chairman. The Reserve Bank was asked to nominate a representative on the committee. I was annoyed and upset by this decision. Chidambaram had clearly overstepped into the RBI turf as liquidity management is a quintessential central bank function. Not only did he not consult me, but he had not even informed me of this before the notification was issued. Coming as it did amidst a lot of suspicion in those early weeks of my tenure that I was a government lackey sent to the Reserve Bank to act at the government\u2019s bidding, the constitution of this committee only reinforced the view.\nI called up Chidambaram and let him know in unequivocal terms that his action was totally inappropriate, and requested firmly that he dissolve the committee. His argument was that when liquidity management was such a central concern, getting advice from external market participants would help us understand and respond to the ground reality in the market faster and better. I granted that, but if he wanted external experience to be tapped, he could have advised me informally to constitute such a committee rather than taking the Reserve Bank for granted. The call ended with my telling him that the Reserve Bank would not participate in the committee. This skirmish with Chidambaram, who I believed pushed my candidature for the governor\u2019s job, so early in my tenure upset me a lot. Little did I know that this set the tone for what would be an uneasy relationship between us in the last year of my term.\nThere was constant and decidedly unhelpful friction between the ministry of finance, under both Pranab Mukherjee and later Chidambaram, and the Reserve Bank on what the government saw as the Reserve Bank\u2019s unduly hawkish stance on interest rates, totally unmindful of growth concerns. The distilled version of their argument went as follows. All the government\u2019s efforts to kickstart the supply response in the economy were being stymied by the high-interest regime of the Reserve Bank. If only the Reserve Bank relaxed on the interest rate, investment would take off and launch the economy into a virtuous cycle of increasing growth and declining inflation.\nWhen Chidambaram was asked in a media interaction in July 2013 why he was frustrated with the Reserve Bank when all it was doing was pursuing its mandate of price stability, he admitted that the Reserve Bank\u2019s mandate was indeed price stability but that \u2018mandate must be understood as part of a larger mandate of promoting growth\u2019. The clear implication was that the Reserve Bank was mistaken in interpreting its mandate.\nI believe both Pranab Mukherjee and Chidambaram had erred in seeing the Reserve Bank as being fixated on inflation, unmindful of growth concerns. On the contrary, the Reserve Bank interprets its mandate exactly as Chidambaram had said, although not as he implied. The Reserve Bank was targeting price stability precisely because it is a necessary condition for sustained growth\u2026.\nThe burden of my argument both in the public domain as well as internally to the government was that the Reserve Bank was running a tight monetary policy not because it did not care for growth but because it did care for growth. But the government remained unpersuaded or chose to be unpersuaded.\nIn order to defend his position vis-a-vis the Reserve Bank and possibly to sound a conciliatory note, in"}

The deal was signed on February 20.\nWith Greece\u2019s existing loan arrangement expiring on February 28 and bankruptcy looming, a last-minute deal was finally agreed after three weeks of intense negotiations. The talks had been characterised by daily \u2014 sometimes hourly \u2014 twists and turns, claims and counterclaims, leaks and threats.\nSYRIZA was elected on January 25 on a wave of hope and rejection of the crippling austerity measures imposed on Greece in return for economic \u201cbail-out\u201d programs by the \u201cTroika\u201d \u2014 the European Central Bank (ECB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU). The deal represents a significant compromise on its election platform.\nAny discussion of debt write-offs, \u201chair-cuts\u201d or renegotiation has been postponed until the next round of negotiations. Funds earmarked for bank recapitalisation will have to be used for that purpose, rather than redirected towards meeting Greece\u2019s desperate social needs.\nGreece no longer has to accept the unilateral diktats of the Troika and is able to negotiate with each body separately. But the new funding still comes with conditions. These include oversight by those same bodies, now referred to as \u201cthe institutions\u201d, and restrictions on how the money can be used.\nThe SYRIZA government is required to refrain from any \u201crollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions\u201d.\nAlthough less than specific, this restriction includes any privatisations already completed, as well as those now underway. Depending on interpretation, this may also impact on measures promised by SYRIZA to improve social welfare, such as raising the minimum wage and restoring collective bargaining rights.\nOn the other hand, the agreement also includes measures that will improve SYRIZA\u2019s ability to fund solutions to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Greece.\nTo gather funds, the government is able to crack down on corruption, tax avoidance, tax immunity (Greece\u2019s powerful shipping owners, for instance, currently pay no tax) and smuggling.\nSuch measures target the vested interests of Greece\u2019s powerful oligarchy \u2014 something previous governments deliberately avoided \u2014 and strengthen the revenue-raising capacity of the Greek state.\nThis approach has already achieved success, with a reported \u20ac500 million already raised.

MacBook Pro is 5% thinner and 3% lighter, for example.\nApple also reduced prices by $200, from $1,499 to $1,299 for the least expensive 13-in. laptop, and from $2,199 to $1,999 for the 15-in. model. Those cuts represented price decreases of 13% and 9%, respectively.\nSince the start of the year, Apple has slashed the price of the entry-level 13-in. Retina MacBook Pro by 24%.\nThe MacBook Pro was Apple's second notebook line this year to see price cuts. In June, Apple rolled out tweaked MacBook Airs at prices 7% to 8% lower than their predecessors.\nHistorically, the Cupertino, Calif., company has rarely lowered Mac prices, preferring instead to keep those stable but swap newer, faster processors for older CPUs, add more memory or increase storage.\nBut times are different, said Stephen Baker of the NPD Group.\n\"Apple's very high premium pricing is getting more difficult to sustain in this environment,\" said Baker, talking about the historic slump in the personal computer industry, now into its sixth straight quarter. \"They needed to bring the pricing more in line with the overall market.\"\nApple has been having a harder time selling Macs, just as has virtually every other computer maker. In the quarter that ended June 30, Apple sold 7% fewer Macs than it did during the same period the year prior, for instance.\nThe price cuts were also an admission by Apple that tablets continue to cannibalize sales of laptops, said Baker. \"Apple's portion of the $1,000-plus PC market is not quite as big as it used to be,\" he noted. \"They've had some cannibalization in their higher buckets.\"\nThat cannibalization has come from both tablets and lower-priced notebooks, including Apple's own MacBook Air line, said Baker. And also, in a small way, from touch-based Windows portables and the even more radical designs known as \"convertibles,\" \"hybrids\" or \"2-in-1s.\"\n\"In the past year, premium-priced Windows [devices] have seen pretty decent growth,\" said Baker. \"They're starting from very low volumes, but that's still growth.\"\nUnlike Windows OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), Apple has an advantage when it comes to tablet cannibalization: It can sell its own iPad and at least keep customers within its garden.\nApple has actually reveled in the trend. \"I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us,\" said CEO Tim Cook during a January 2013 conference call with Wall Street. \"One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it, and so we never fear it. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs [so] that doesn't worry us.\"\nBaker thought that was smart.\n\"They get retail, and one of the key pieces of retail is that products get cannibalized,\" said Baker."}

Many activists in what Moscow would have otherwise continued to regard as the Republic of Macedonia per its constitutionally legitimate name are sorely disappointed by this purely political move and are struggling to understand why it happened, but the reason actually isn\u2019t all that unexpected in hindsight. It needs to be recognized that while there were veritably very powerful soft power merits to Moscow continuing to inspire (key word) protests by refusing to recognize the so-called \u201ccompromise name\u201d that Zaev agreed to impose on his people for the express purpose of expediting the country\u2019s entry into the EU and NATO, the modern-day Russian Federation isn\u2019t driven whatsoever by ideological motivations like its Soviet predecessor but is instead coldly pragmatic in pursuing its own interests.\nIn contrast to the way that he\u2019s often portrayed by Alt-Media (and especially through misleadingly decontextualized memes and quotes spread by the \u201cPutinist\u201d cult), President Putin actually isn\u2019t as anti-Western as many of his international supporters have been encouraged to believe. He\u2019s indisputably a more sovereignty-focused leader than his predecessor and a much stronger one at that, but instead of being the \u201cenemy\u201d of the \u201cNew World Order\u201d that a lot of people are under the mistaken impression that he is, President Putin assumed the role of a \u201cbalancer\u201d between it and the emerging Multipolar World Order in order to enable Russia to decisively influence the balance of power between the American and Chinese superpowers in a game-changing way in pursuing his country\u2019s interests at any given time. This flexible grand strategy explains why Russia is simultaneously advancing the construction of alternative multipolar global institutions like the BRICS Development Bank in parallel with seeking a \u201cNew D\u00e9tente\u201d with the West in order to receive sanctions relief.\nBy accepting this strategic backdrop in spite of the sadness that it might cause in the hearts of well-intended people the world over who placed their entire hopes in President Putin as a \u201chero\u201d who they mistakenly thought put all of his effort into endlessly fighting against the \u201cNew World Order\u201d, it\u2019s much easier to understand Russia\u2019s recognition of \u201cNorth Macedonia\u201d and the larger motivation behind this move.

Published on September 29, 2015.\nThe current programmatic space is wrought with challenges, but programmatic 3.0, as an Advertising Week panel coined it, pales in comparison to the challenges of programmatic 2.0.\nProgrammatic 1.0 arose from a need to sell remnant inventory, explained Shenan Reed, president of digital for WPP's MEC in North America. \"There was better ROI for us [in 2.0], but it led to a lot of pushing down on price and dilution of quality,\" she said. \"[Programmatic] 1.0 had better quality, but 2.0 was wrought with challenges. 3.0 is our turn to say we want to make it work harder for us.\"\nIn the early days of programmatic, when publishers were trying to sell extra inventory, sell rates were only 10% to 30%, she said. \"The challenge was in creating revenue that was meaningful. They ultimately sold off too much inventory at too low a price.\"\nToday, it's about getting back to quality inventory that reaches the right people with the right messaging, agreed panelists.\n\"There was a time we had to sacrifice scale for quality. Now big publishers like me don't need to do that anymore,\" said Jeremy Randol, VP of programmatic sales strategy at Pandora. \"2016 will be the year of programmatic mobile. We've seen companies make strides in defining cross-device [metrics]. DSPs are doing a better job. And there's a migration toward more quality connections.\"\nHe said Pandora one and a half years ago hired people who could make programmatic a mainstream sales tactic. His team has grown to 10 people.\nMs. Reed asked the group if in the next version of the marketplace advertisers will be able to buy against a cost-per-acquisition metric. Currently, most buying happens on a CPM, or cost-per-thousand-impression metric.\n\"We'll sell against how effective the advertising is,\" said Mark Zagorski, CEO of Nielsen's Exelate. \"We're moving into a world where everything is sold on a CPA basis.\"\n\"We'll get to a place where sellers can make some real money again,\" added Ms. Reed. \"We've been pushing media partners down and down on these CPMs because we don't see it working.

Unfortunately, though, it seems like there's a chance everything has changed. Reportedly, Chris has bailed on Kail and Baby Lo. What?!\nAccording to what a friend of the Teen Mom 2 mama told Hollywood Life, Chris isn't there for the baby like Kailyn thought he'd be after he showed up to the hospital to be there when the baby was born ... and it's really not looking good for the future.\n\"Kail's relationship with Chris has been like a rollercoaster -- full of ups and downs and unexpected turns. After he showed up for the delivery and drove them home from the hospital, Kailyn thought there was going to be a good chance he would actually be in his son's life. He even made the effort to visit a few times, with gifts for the baby. But just as Kailyn started believing that Chris may actually be committed to being a dad, he bails.\"\nOh no! That sounds like a miserable thing to deal with when you're juggling life with a newborn (and two kids!) as a single mom.\nWe're not convinced this story is true, though.

Some people are mature and disciplined enough to wait until after the Queen\u2019s speech.\nHowever, for others, tradition dictates that the exchange of gifts happens on Christmas Eve. This isn\u2019t necessarily down to impatience, it\u2019s a big cultural tradition across Europe.\nIn France, festivities usually begin with an elaborate, multi-course dinner on Christmas eve, called \u201cle r\u00e9veillon de No\u00ebl\u201d \u2013 and presents typically follow. Some people follow this tradition for different reasons.\nMost regular churchgoers wouldn\u2019t dream of celebrating the season without attending midnight Mass. Even if your approach to festivities is typically more secular, a late night church visit can be a way of starting a busy, boozy 72 hours in a peaceful, contemplative setting.\nOK, it\u2019s peaceful and contemplative until the pubs close, and you have the chance to hear tipsy churchgoers turn up late and then really go for it and try to do the descant of O Come All Ye Faithful. My family are faithful midnight Mass attendees, and equally committed to staying sober for the duration of the service.\nHowever, tradition dictates that as soon as we get home afterwards, we get stuck into the red wine and hot sausage rolls.\nMany people dread Secret Santa, the tradition of buying an anonymous gift for a selected participant, usually for under a fiver.\nOften the ritual involves forgetting about it until the 22nd, getting an email that reminds you that you\u2019re supposed to be swapping presents over lunch, and hyperventilating at the till of your nearest stationery shop wondering whether Nigel from accounts really wants a photo frame decorated with pineapples.\nHowever, my five sisters and I have made Secret Santa a family tradition \u2013 and we each buy one gift for one sister, instead of presenting each other with a series of pineapple photo frames.\nSecret Santa comes with its own micro traditions, like trying to coordinate the draw using an app, syncing it with Facebook, and accidentally inviting old colleagues and ex boyfriends to exchange gifts, before giving up and doing it with bits of paper.\nA full stocking simply isn\u2019t enough to prove that your house has been visited by Father Christmas \u2013 savvy Santa fans like to see a smeary, empty sherry glass, a few mince pie crumbs, or at least a discarded, nibbled carrot top, abandoned by Rudolph.\nSome parents report that since they\u2019ve had children, Santa has started leaving sparkly footprints between the fireplace and the tree. In addition to the standard schooner and pie, I used to leave Santa a chocolate tree decoration, and courteous Santa would always thank me for it in his handwritten letter.\nNow I think about it, it\u2019s amazing that Santa could visit the houses of every single boy and girl in the world and have time to leave a note. That\u2019s a man who knows how to work to a deadline.\nThe spherical, white iced, berry embellished Christmas pudding is such an iconic festive symbol that it\u2019s hard to believe that there isn\u2019t a Christmas pudding emoji.\nAny tradition that involves setting food on fire is a thrilling one \u2013 whether your pudding has been boiled and steamed after months of"}

The big picture: 3D printing enables virtual spare parts inventories.\n3D printing a replacement part It's surprisingly easy to create and print replacement parts. In this hands on, David Gewirtz shows how he created a fan cover replacement. The big picture: 3D printing enables virtual spare parts inventories.\n3D printing is often touted as a great tool for designers to test and refine their designs prior to manufacturing. But you can do a lot more with 3D printing, even with inexpensive home printers. For example, you can use a 3D printer to create and produce a replacement part for something you use every day. In my case, I made a replacement back cover for a remote control.\nI have a desk fan I use all the time, the Vornado Flippi V Compact Air Circulator. It lives a few feet away from me, under my desk. It's small, powerful, and quiet. What makes it particularly useful is a remote control I can use to adjust the speed and oscillation, without ever moving away from my keyboard. This is great because I can turn it on and off when on the phone, or just tap the remote control when I'm too busy or lazy to move the five feet from my chair to the fan.\nThe problem is that I drop the remote all the time, and the back cover for the battery compartment tends to fly off and get lost. It really interrupts workflow to have to crawl around under my desk to look for the tiny part.\nNow, don't get mired in the details of this particular project. Instead, keep in mind the idea of making any replacement part. Obviously, whatever you need to make will be different from what I worked on. The key point is that a 3D printer can be a great resource for useful projects like crafting replacement parts for objects you use. Lots of people lose a part or two from a beloved object.\nAfter dropping the remote for probably the 20th time, and not being able to locate the cover to the battery compartment after a long search, I decided enough was enough.\nHas anyone seen my missing cover?\nIt's probably still somewhere down there, under my desk, unless the elves have taken it. I decided to make a new one.\nI'm fortunate, because I have a number of 3D printers in the shop to choose from. If I weren't writing about 3D printing, I'd probably only have one. For this project, I chose to use the most inexpensive of them, the $399 New Matter MOD-t. The MOD-t isn't as fast as the LulzBot or the MakerBot, nor does it create objects of super high quality, but it's a fine little printer.\nI was curious about whether I could use it for this purpose. The cover is quite small, making it possible to do a lot of print attempts. Each print only took about 20 minutes. Because I spent just a few minutes each time refining the design, the print time for each \"draft\" didn't bother me at all.\nThe key to the design was exploring and understanding the geometry of the cover. That may sound difficult, but all it really takes is observation, measuring, a little creativity, and the willingness to test.\nThe basic shape is that of a rectangle with a half-circle at the end. So I created a rectangle and circle in 123D Design and placed the circle over the rectangle. I then shrunk the thickness to 1.5"}

Robert Bales made a mid-massacre confession, asked for help bleaching his blood-stained clothing and deliberately destroyed his laptop computer, fellow soldiers have testified -- statements that prosecutors say show he knew what he was doing the night 16 civilians were slaughtered in two villages in southern Afghanistan.\nThe remarks, offered by soldiers testifying for the government Monday and Tuesday, could pose a high hurdle for defense lawyers who have indicated that Bales' mental health will be a big part of their case. Testimony continues with several more witnesses Wednesday in a preliminary hearing that is being held to help determine whether the case goes to a court-martial.\nBales, a 39-year-old father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., faces 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in the March 11 attack on the villages of Balandi and Alkozai, which counted nine children among its victims.\nOne of the worst atrocities of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the attack prompted the U.S. to halt combat operations for days in the face of protests, and military investigators couldn't reach the crime scenes for a month.\nA prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse, said Bales spent the evening before the massacre at his remote outpost of Camp Belambay with two other soldiers, watching a movie about revenge killings, sharing contraband whiskey from a plastic bottle and discussing an attack that cost one of their comrades his leg.\nWithin hours, a cape-wearing Bales slipped away from the post and embarked on a killing spree of his own, said the prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse. He attacked one village then returned to Belambay, where he woke up a colleague and reported what he'd done, Morse said. The colleague testified that he didn't believe Bales and went back to sleep.\nBales headed out again, Morse said, and attacked the second village before returning once again in the predawn darkness, bloody and incredulous that his comrades ordered him to surrender his weapons.\nA medic, Sgt. 1st Class James Stillwell, said Tuesday he saw Bales covered in blood and knew from the pattern of the staining it wasn't his own. He asked where it came from and where he'd been.\nThe statement was one of many attributed to Bales that suggest he knew what he was doing, prosecutors say.\nSoldiers testified that after being taken into custody, Bales told them, \"I thought I was doing the right thing.\"\nAnd Stillwell said Bales told him that the soldiers at Camp Belambay would appreciate his actions once the fighting season ramped up: \"You guys are going to thank me come June.\"\nAt another point, Bales remarked, \"I guess four was too many\" -- an apparent reference to the number of family compounds in the attacked villages, Morse said Monday.\nBales was largely calm and compliant when he turned himself in following the massacre, several soldiers testified Tuesday. He followed orders and sometimes sat with his head in his hands, as though the magnitude of what he had done was sinking in, one said.\nAt one point, Bales made a joke -- pointing his finger, in the shape of a gun, at two soldiers guarding him -- in what they took as a failed effort to ease the tension.\nBut Bales also deliberately mangled his laptop, said two soldiers assigned to guard him as he gathered his things.\nOne of them"}

Gustav Holst got it wrong when he composed his famous suite, The Planets.\nVenus is anything but lovely. It's more like a furnace with sulfur clouds and crushing atmospheric pressure.\nAnd Graf can't have rookie astronomical mistakes if he is to conduct The Planets in NASA's hometown. So the Houston Symphony decided to fix the problem. Or at least turn the problem into art.\nWith the help of filmmaker Duncan Copp and state-of-the-art space images, the Houston Symphony has created The Planets \u2014 An HD Odyssey. The production is a musical and visual performance piece that features a high-definition movie of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and the other movements of Holst's suite.\nThe new movie debuts Thursday in Jones Hall in a live Houston Symphony concert of the work. Performances continue next weekend before the orchestra takes its new production to Florida and New York City's Carnegie Hall.\nThe new movie was commissioned by the Houston Symphony and created by Copp, the London-based producer of the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, which told the story of the Apollo astronauts.\nIn addition to the live performances, the Houston Symphony created a DVD of the movie and music for sofa-side viewing. Graf also expects the movie to be used by other symphonies in live performances.\nThough recognized as a powerful combination, pictures in the concert hall have been met with enthusiasm and criticism.\nIt's not new in Houston.\nSince 2005, the Houston Symphony has hung big screens in Jones Hall for some of its performances, projecting closeups of musicians just like on television. Graf conducted Richard Strauss' Alpine Symphony in 2008 set against images of a hike in the Alps. Recently, piano superstar Leif Ove Andsnes launched a project combining new visual works set to Mussorgksy's Pictures at an Exhibition that he performed in Houston and other cities.\nThough many found Andsnes' project riveting and a sign of classical music's visual future, critics complained that the images distracted from the beauty of the music and the pianist's performance.\nAdding images to musical performance is not for all occasions, Graf said. Bach or Beethoven might be better left unadorned, he said.\nIn a world increasingly glued to television, computer, movie and phone screens, it makes sense for the Houston Symphony to present a program such as The Planets \u2014 An HD Odyssey, said Dave Kirk, Houston Symphony principal tuba player.\nThe project, Kirk said, also has ignited interest in the Houston community. Ticket sales prove him right. The Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon shows were sold out more than a week before the performances. One of the last times the 2,100 seats were filled was for a concert of music including Star Wars.\n\u201cAnything that increases people's awareness of what we do as an orchestra helps us artistically,\u201d said Kirk.\nThe Planets lends itself to the project.

His goal is to silence or at least delegitimize those who criticize him\u2014from the news media to comedians like Bee and \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d It\u2019s as if Trump is following page by page the \u201cDictator for Dummies\u201d playbook.\nUntil now, much of the criticism of Trump regarding the Roseanne Barr-Samantha Bee controversy has rightly been about the White House\u2019s swift denunciation of Bee but Trump\u2019s refusal to denounce Barr\u2019s racist tweet that compared former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Trump, who had praised Roseanne in March after her show\u2019s premier by personally calling her and then touting her in a rally where he told the crowd the show was \u201cabout us,\u201d has still not condemned his long time friend\u2019s racism.\nBut that\u2019s Trump. This is the same guy who refused to denounce David Duke during the campaign when first asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. And then after Charlottesville, Trump equated the white supremacists with those protesting hate by saying there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. And this is the same Trump, who to the delight of the primarily white crowds at his rallies, will demean visible black people from Jay-Z (as we saw again this week) to Rep. Maxine Waters to NFL players who took a knee to protest institutional racism.\nTrump is a man who trafficked in bigotry and racism to win the White House. It\u2019s vile but it plays well with much of today\u2019s GOP base.\nBut Trump\u2019s attacks on freedom of expression go far beyond just news media. Trump also wants to silence those in the entertainment world who are vocal critics. During the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump demanded Saturday Night Live be cancelled for its \u201chit job on me,\u201d as Trump put it on Twitter. And even after Trump won, he still slammed SNL as being \u201cterrible,\u201d clearly with the hopes of hurting the show\u2019s ratings.\nAnd now we have Trump calling on Bee to be fired. You know who else hates comedy at their expense? Authoritarian leaders. Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a man Trump loves, banned Egypt\u2019s version of The Daily Show because of the way its comedy mocked the government. The show\u2019s star, Bassem Youssef, had to flee the country and is now living in exile with his family.\nTurkey\u2019s strongman leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the prosecution of a German comedian for simply reading a poem mocking Erdogan. While the case did go to court, it was ultimately dropped. But Erdogan\u2019s intended goal of silencing comedians who dare mock the Turkish leader was heard.\nSo for those who think Trump calling for the firing of Bee is simply about a profane (and obviously indefensible) joke focusing on his daughter, think again. This is all part of Trump\u2019s efforts to follow in the footsteps of people like Vladimir Putin, Sisi, and Erdogan to stifle free speech and criticism"}

Makuch, the reporter who communicated with Shirdon over a Kik text messaging app and wrote three articles in 2014 on the Canadian, agreed and went further. He believes Shirdon is dead, and the RCMP is simply trying to expand its reach in a digital age.\nThe case drew a slew of black-robed lawyers for various media organizations who were supportive intervenors. Tunley argued that even a new federal law that requires prior notice to media of police applications for production orders, and sets out other protections for \u201cconfidential\u201d sources, doesn\u2019t go far enough because it doesn\u2019t protect communications with \u201cnon-confidential\u201d sources.\nVice says Shirdon never asked for nor was granted confidentiality or anonymity by its reporter, and that the reporter\u2019s work materials should remain off limits to the police.\nMichaelson said Canada already has a robust legal framework that sets out a case-by-case analysis which requires courts to weigh the public interest in investigation and prosecution of criminal offences against the public interest in a vibrant free press.\nHowever, several judges challenged whether that was enough or whether additional steps \u2014 like advance notice to the media in the first instance when police seek a warrant; or when an appeal judge reviews a warrant or production order \u2014 are required to really protect the right.\nJustices Rosalie Abella and Brown asked Michaelson what exactly he believes the Charter protects. He replied the constitutional freedom of expression guarantee expressly protects \u201cfreedom of the press\u201d including a right to gather and disseminate information. He conceded that certain protections should be extended not just to \u201cconfidential\u201d sources but also to the private, \u201coff the record\u201d or \u201cnot for attribution\u201d communications between reporters and their sources who agree to be named.\nMichaelson, a senior Crown attorney who has long prosecuted high-profile criminal and terrorism cases, admitted he occasionally speaks to reporters but only on condition his"}

The Bulls used the Wolves\u2019 seventh pick to acquire Arizona 7-foot shooter Lauri Markkanen.\nA year after the two teams discussed such a trade, Thibodeau and General Manager Scott Layden pulled off their first one together.\nIt\u2019s a big one, too \u2014 just behind the one in team history that sent superstar Kevin Garnett to Boston in 2007 and probably even with the 2014 trade that sent away Kevin Love and brought Andrew Wiggins.\nIn trading for Jimmy Butler on Thursday night, the Wolves get a three-time All-Star and a physical perimeter defender who turns 28 in September.\nButler gives the Wolves an experienced, physical defender to put beside young stars Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, both of whom could use some defensive tutoring from one of the league\u2019s best in that department.\nGiven the NBA\u2019s current economics, Butler is a bona fide star signed to a relative bargain contract that pays him $18.7 million this coming season and $19.8 million in 2018-19. He has a $19.8 million player option in 2019-20.\nApparently, Butler will be missed in Chicago.\nTo get Butler back, the Wolves traded LaVine, the 13th player taken in the 2014 and a two-time All-Star dunk contest winner who\u2019s recovering from February knee surgery. They also dealt Dunn, the fifth player in last year\u2019s draft whom the Bulls coveted when the two teams discussed a Butler trade on draft day in 2016.\nThibodeau lauded Dunn\u2019s development more than once when he and Layden held a pre-draft media briefing on Wednesday.\nDuring that briefing, Thibodeau identified the Wolves\u2019 biggest needs as shooting, defense and toughness, and Butler provides all three, but those final two qualities in particular.\nThe last player (30th overall) selected in the 2011 draft\u2019s first round, Butler will turn 28 in September.\nHe was raised in Tomball, Texas, and in Chicago wore uniform No. 21, which was former Wolves superstar Kevin Garnett\u2019s number throughout his Wolves\u2019 career.\nWhen ESPN reached him by telephone about 2 a.m. Friday Paris time, Butler declined to comment.

The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large\u201419 microns to be exact. That\u2019s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx. Huge pixels mean they can capture a huge amount of light.\nIn this case, Canon\u2019s sensor reaches an insane 4,000,000 ISO. Yeah, four million. Basically it sees better in the dark than you can. Remember, this is without infrared night vision tricks. It\u2019s normal color 1080p video at 24, 30, or 60 fps.\nBefore you get excited at what this means for your gritty neo-noir short film set in an dark alley, let me tell you that this camera is not meant for most consumers. First off, it\u2019s $30,000. And it\u2019s made for \u201cindustrial\u201d uses. Not sure what that really means, but Canon mentioned things like nighttime surveillance and wildlife documentaries. Something tells me many crazies will think of other cool uses for it.

Though proving people wrong with a $30,000 device is an interesting way to go.\nIn any case, we can all look forward to eye-popping nighttime footage coming out of this thing in the near future when the camera ships in December."}

Well, some startups are focusing on ensuring that Ruby on Rails, also known simply as Rails, does indeed scale.\nRuby on Rails, like the Ruby language it is based on, has been used in several Web 2.0 applications such as Twitter, Jobster and Shopify, as well as beginning to appear in a number of enterprise applications. However, despite many success stories, what tends to stand out are the tales of how Rails took a development project 95 percent of the way to the Promised Land of enterprise scalability but needed a boost from some other language to get the application over the hump.\nSteven Beales, chief software architect at Mdlogix (Medical Decision Logic) said Mdlogix views Rails as the most productive tool it has for developing simple-looking Web applications with advanced functionality. However, Mdlogix is also using Rails for enterprise development.\nAnd for enterprise organizations concerned about issues of scalability and performance with Rails, help is on the way.\nA startup called New Relic, backed by venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, and particularly by Benchmark General Partner Peter Fenton, who has made some big bets in funding companies like JBoss, Red Hat, MySQL and SpringSource, has launched to address Ruby on Rails application performance management.\nRuby shines on all platforms. Click here to read more.\nNew Relic announced on May 1 that it had received $3.5 million in first-round venture financing from Benchmark Capital. The company plans to use the funds to drive product development and to expand sales and marketing programs, and Fenton will join its board of directors.\nNew Relic RPM, a subscription-based Rails performance management solution, enables developers to quickly and cost effectively detect, diagnose and fix application performance problems in real time, the company said. This SAAS (software as a service) offering is currently available to a limited customer base as a private beta, but will be generally available to the entire Ruby on Rails community soon.\nLewis Cirne, founder of New Relic, founded Wily Technology in 1998, which provided the same type of solution for Java. Cirne said he views Rails as the same kind of game-changing technology that Java has proven to be. Cirne eventually sold Wily to CA.\n\"The critiques we hear about Rails [are] it's not scalable, that it's not well-suited for mission-critical applications,\" Fenton said. \"I think those critiques are similar in nature to what we heard about Java in the mid-90s.\"\nHowever, to find problems and to help applications scale, \"You have to find out where the bottlenecks are,\" which is what New Relic does, Fenton said. \"The monitoring insight New Relic has is to provide visibility without adding overhead.\"\nMoreover, Fenton, who said Cirne's Wily Technology firm was the first investment he made at Benchmark, added that Benchmark's commitment to Rails is as deep as its commitment to Java in the '90s. \"Couple that with cloud computing and this [Rails] could be much more rapidly adopted than Java,\" Fenton said.\nMoreover, Fenton said he believes Rails could be \"as big a force for change for developers\" as cloud computing may be.\n\"We're really excited"}

In retaliation, he formally broke off talks with Washington on a Bilateral Security Agreement that would provide for US troops remaining in the country after the December 2014 deadline that Washington and NATO have set for withdrawing all their forces.\nJust hours before the Obama White House announced the planned talks with the Taliban, four US soldiers were killed in a mortar attack on the heavily fortified Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul. The Taliban claimed credit for the attack and reported that it had wounded six other troops.\nTwenty-three US troops have been killed so far this month, bringing the total number to have lost their lives since the launching of Operation Enduring Freedom in October 2001 to 2,243. Another 444 British troops as well as 653 from other NATO and US-aligned countries have also died.\nAfghan casualties undoubtedly number in the hundreds of thousands. According to the United Nations, the number of civilians killed or wounded from the beginning of this year until June 6 reached 3,092, a 24 percent increase over the same period last year. And the Afghan NGO Security Office reported that there were 47 percent more attacks launched by the Taliban and other groups opposed to the government and the foreign troops that support it in the first quarter of this year than in the same period in the first quarter of 2011.\nAs for the Afghan forces, while the army has 350,000 troops on the books, they are poorly trained and armed and are suffering heavy casualties as well as morale problems that lead to a loss of about a third of their ranks each year through desertions and failure to re-enlist. According to a Pentagon report issued last December, only 1 out of 23 Afghanistan National Army brigades is capable of operating on its own without US-NATO support.\nGiven the state of the Afghan military and the pledge to withdraw the bulk of the US-NATO troops by the end of next year, the Taliban appears to be going into the talks with the US and its puppet regime with a fair amount of confidence and is showing no inclination to put down its arms any time soon.\nAccording to Afghan officials, the Karzai regime was angered by the Taliban\u2019s presentation of its office in Doha not merely as an outpost for peace talks, but rather a virtual embassy for a rival government. One official who spoke to the Reuters news agency cited in particular the hoisting over the office of a Taliban flag and a banner of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban regime was known before it was overthrown by the US in 2001.\nKarzai apparently fears that the US could reach a deal with the Taliban at his expense. Given Washington\u2019s increasing reliance on Islamist forces in Egypt and Turkey and in the wars it has instigated in Libya and Syria, such a concern is understandable.\nUS officials have publicly stated that they are seeking three commitments by the Taliban as the sole basis for a settlement: a formal break of"}

Dr. Furnas is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey also suggests that patients rely on the plastic surgery practice's website over social media when seeking important information.\nDr. Furnas and coauthors surveyed 100 patients making visits to their aesthetic plastic surgery practice regarding social media habits and preferences. The patients, average age 44 years, were nearly all women. Most were interested in facial plastic surgery; some were interested in breast, body, or other cosmetic procedures.\nMost patients used YouTube and Pinterest, but engagement was low. While only about one-fourth of patients were on Snapchat, most of them used it daily. Twitter was the least popular social media platform.\nThe plastic surgery practice's website beat out all social media platforms as the go-to source of online information. More than half of patients said they were influenced by the website when selecting a cosmetic surgery practice, compared to just eight percent for Facebook. More than 60 percent of patients checked the practice website on the day of their visit.\nOut of 11 social media post categories, most patients chose before-and-after photos of cosmetic surgery procedures. More than one-fourth wanted to see information about the procedures; few selected didactic types of information.\nPlastic surgeons can better reach and engage with their target population if they use the social media networks popular with their patients\u2019 demographic. For example, women prefer Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, but Facebook in particular is most popular among the age group of women most likely to be interested in plastic surgery. While Twitter is widely used by plastic surgeons to share and discuss research, the new survey suggests it's the least popular platform among cosmetic surgery patients.\nThe fleeting content on social media may be less important than the information provided by the plastic surgeon's practice website.\n\"These results suggest that the website should be considered the centerpiece of a practice's online content,\" Dr. Furnas and coauthors write. \"Social media should be viewed as an adjunct to attract and engage users, enticing them to explore the practice website.\"\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae is published by Wolters Kluwer.\nWolters Kluwer reported 2016 annual revenues of \u20ac4.3 billion.

It defined the Democratic Party as a vigorous, motivated, organized force that is . . . completely out of touch with mainstream America.\nDon't get me wrong. Lamont is a perfectly respectable candidate -- well-spoken, attractive, gracious and rich. What's not to like? And millions of Americans of every political stripe are disgusted with the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war.\nBut what happened in Connecticut allowed the rest of the country a close glimpse of what the Democratic Party has become -- a ruthless machine of the far left, fueled by left-wing blogs and personified by the stubbornly adolescent Michael Moore.\nTheir triumph in bringing down Lieberman may prove to be their undoing in November, as well as in the 2008 presidential election. Here's why: Americans may not like the war, or the deficit, or the Bush administration's immigration stance, or pick-your-grievance. We enjoy a surfeit of issues to divide us. But Americans also share a reflexive resistance to Stalinist tactics.\nWhat else can one call the message now being telegraphed to Democratic leaders? You either stand with us against the war in Iraq, or we take you down.\nThe morning after Lamont's victory, for instance, Moore posted a note on his Web site to Democratic candidates that is a threat without the veil. He specifically targeted Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and John Edwards, all likely presidential candidates in '08.\nNoting that nearly every Democrat planning to run for president had voted for or supported the war, Moore said, \"we are going to make sure they pay for that mistake. Payback time started last night.\"\nEven though both Kerry and Edwards have changed their minds and are now anti-war, that's too late for Moore, who wrote: \"Their massive error in judgment is, sadly, proof that they are not fit for the job. They sided with Bush, and for that, they may never enter the promised land.\"\nTo Clinton, he spoke directly: \"I'm here to tell you that you will never make it through the Democratic primaries unless you start now by strongly opposing the war. It is your only hope.\"\nAs for the rest, \"To every Democratic Senator and Congressman who continues to back Bush's War, allow me to inform you that your days in elective office are now numbered. Myself and tens of millions of citizens are going to work hard to actively remove you from any position of power.\"\nMoore's manifesto, through which he may have lost a few grammarians, is straight out of Stalin's playbook under \"P\" for purge. Like Stalin, the operatives who ousted Lieberman are determined to remove dissidents from The Party.\nClinton, among others, snapped to. Looking grim before television cameras, she vowed her allegiance to the party, promising to support Lamont in the general election against Lieberman, who is running as an independent. And though Clinton has resisted calls for a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq, she recently hammered Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in an apparent attempt to distance herself from the"}

That left freed slaves to build their homes on bottomland. That's where Princeville became the country's first town incorporated by black Americans.

In 1999, Hurricane Floyd's rains overwhelmed a dike and submerged the town in water 23 feet (7 meters) deep in spots.\nMany people with limited means, like the disabled Howells, will struggle to escape and rebuild after Florence's damage is done.\nThe median household income of Princeville's 2,300 residents is about $28,000 a year compared to the statewide $48,000, and almost six of ten town residents had public health insurance such as Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program in 2016, according to the US Census Bureau.\nForecasters are warning anyone living near waterways in the Carolinas to seek higher ground, and that means trouble for some of the poorest communities in eastern North Carolina and South Carolina where black people have faced historic inequality.\n\"What I'm fearful about is there are a lot of people who are not going to be OK because they don't have elevated structures,\" said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. \"They're in low-lying flood prone areas and they didn't leave because they had nowhere to go and no resources to get there.\"\nPeople still haven't recovered fully from Matthew in small, economically struggling communities across eastern North Carolina, from Seven Springs and Windsor near Virginia's border to Lumberton along the South Carolina line.\nGov.

The president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, warned earlier this summer that athletes who bowed out of competition without a good reason would face sanctions.\nBahram Afsharzadeh, secretary-general of the Iranian Olympic committee, seemed to swear off any boycott in his remarks. \u201cWe just follow the sportsmanship and play every country,\u201d Afsharzadeh was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and other outlets Monday.\nThe Associated Press noted that at times, Afsharzadeh had been speaking through an interpreter. In Iran, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Tuesday that his words had been twisted, saying that Afsharzadeh had never named Israel in his remarks.\nThe debate may be a purely symbolic one: Iranian athletes are unlikely to face Israelis in competition at all, with the two countries sending few Olympians in the same categories, according to Israeli media.\nAn Iranian judo practitioner who might have faced an Israeli in competition, Javad Mahjoub, is reportedly missing the Games due to gastric illness -- a withdrawal that some have eyed suspiciously. In the past, Mahjoub told Iranian media he had deliberately lost a match to avoid facing off with an Israeli.\nThe International Olympic Committee said it was impossible to know at this stage whether any of the countries' athletes would face each other, \"as it will depend on qualifiers during the Games.\"\nIn several countries across the Middle East, Olympians have faced pressure to sidestep competing against Israeli athletes as a political statement. Some Iranian athletes avoided matches with Israelis by withdrawing from events at the Olympics in 2004 and 2008, according to the Associated Press.\nThe Olympics come at a time of continuing tensions between the two counties: Iran and Israel have long been at odds over Iran's disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is solely for peaceful purposes.

Over 90 percent of principals report confronting at least three of the problems I just listed: incivility, false information, threats of gun violence, anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, and the opioid crisis. This is the world of the American high school today.\nRogers and his colleagues provide a rich analysis of the survey data and contextualize it with relevant research on political climate, gun violence, etc. But what makes the report come poignantly alive are the many comments offered by the principals themselves.\nThere\u2019s a greater divide than there has been in years past between liberals and conservatives\u2014which I think everybody sees.

Back in 2016, based on the orders of election related t-shirts and flags, manufacturers from Yiwu had predicted Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidency five months in advance. Observers say that textile factories in Yiwu have started receiving orders from the U.S and have begun manufacturing flags and T-shirts for Trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election. The demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the Democratic Party. Some have started to predict that Trump would be re-elected.

Yiwu's international trade city has an Index called the Yiwu China commodity index that reflects market trends.\nDuring the US election in 2016, the Yiwu Index became a hot topic on Chinese social media, as discussions about election-related merchandise order records in Yiwu seemed to indicate that Donald Trump was more popular than Hillary Clinton. After the election, even state-affiliated media reported that commodity order records from Yiwu and Alibaba had predictive power, and many Chinese netizens believed that the Yiwu Index was more accurate than the US election polls. Some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic, as Clinton, in fact, received more votes than Trump, but this analysis was ignored.\nThis time, state-affiliated media outlet Global Times fact-checked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last year's. The Global Times report, however, has done nothing to stop the spread of the Yiwu Index myth. In fact, new commentary emerged after the Christmas reasserting the predictive power of Yiwu Index.

These properties define a regime known as \u201cnetwork neutrality.\u201d In 2005, some large isps proposed that application and content providers directly pay them additional fees for accessing the isps\u2019 residential clients, as well as differential fees for prioritizing certain content. We analyze the private and social incentives to introduce such fees when the network is congested and more traffic implies delays. We find that network neutrality is welfare superior to bandwidth subdivision (granting or selling priority service). We also consider the welfare properties of the various regimes that have been proposed as alternatives to network neutrality. In particular, we show that the benefit of a zero-price \u201cslow lane\u201d is a function of the bandwidth the regulator mandates be allocated it. Extending the analysis to consider isps\u2019 incentives to invest in more bandwidth, we show that, under general conditions, their incentives are greatest when they can price discriminate; this investment incentive offsets to some degree the allocative distortion created by the introduction of price discrimination. A priori , it is ambiguous whether the offset is sufficient to justify departing from network neutrality.\" -- \" The Economics of Network Neutrality\", by Nicholas Economides and Benjamin E.
