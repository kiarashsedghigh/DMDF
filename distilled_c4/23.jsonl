The crowd\u2019s attention was focused on Eric Walters, a microbiology Ph.D. student studying the parasite Giardia.\nWalters\u2019 goal that night was to make his audience care.\nWelcome to Sacramento Science Idol, an outreach event organized by science communicators, including UC Davis graduate students and alumni. Each of the 10 presenters had three minutes to present science research in a succinct manner digestible to the public. The event was hosted by the Powerhouse Science Center, Capital Science Communicators and Science Says, a student-run organization focused on cultivating science communication in the UC Davis community.\nThe night\u2019s topics ranged from why plants have certain flavors and the puzzle of autism to scientific literacy and public policy. Though it was a competition, the vibe was friendly and inviting.\nWalters explained his lab uses Giardia as a model organism, a small, less complex organism that follows the same rules of life as humans. \u201cWe can look at these tiny parasites and when we see how they grow and how their cells divide, we learn a lot about how we work,\u201d he said to the audience.\nWalters\u2019 research focuses on microtubules, which give Giardia cells their structure. When Giardia infects a host, its microtubules rearrange to form a suction cup-shaped dome. Giardia uses this disc-like structure to latch onto a host\u2019s intestines, allowing it to stick around and sicken the host.\nSacramento Science Idol is part of a larger speaking series cohosted by Science Says called Sac Science Distilled. Organized with a caf\u00e9 scientifique sensibility in mind, the events are designed as an informal way for real scientists to meet and talk with the general public. Previous talk topics have included geology, HIV research and parasites.\nFounded in 2015 by Distinguished Professor Pamela Ronald, Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, Science Says started as a project funded by the UC Davis Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy and was intended as a way to combat misinformation in food science. Since then, it\u2019s grown into a campus-wide student group. Today, approximately 30 graduate students are members, and the group is involved in a number of projects, including blogs, a book club, videos and public events.\nUpcoming Science Says events include \u201cTiny Solutions to Big Problems in Human Medicine\u201d and the \u201cScience Says: Carnival\u201d scheduled to coincide with UC Davis Picnic Day."}

Fresno State took a 13-0 lead after the first quarter in which UCLA rushed for just 38 yards and had 40 penalty yards.\nThe Bruins did both things head coach Chip Kelly said they would work to improve. They committed the procedural penalties from their season opener against Cincinnati, including two illegal formation calls and an illegal motion. They tacked on more costly penalties with holding and pass interference calls, the type of fouls Kelly said the team had to clean up after the loss to Oklahoma.\nThree of the penalties Saturday negated positive plays on offense for the Bruins and four others gave Fresno State first downs. Lake\u2019s third-down roughing-the-passer call in the third quarter of what was then a two-point game extended a Fresno State drive that resulted in a touchdown and a two-point conversion. It was suddenly a two-possession game.\nThe Bruins rank 95th in the country in penalties per game (7.67).

Rick Snyder on Friday still isn't enough money to relieve the city's water bill debt, city officials said.\n\"We appreciate everything that has come our way,\" said Flint Council President, Kerry Nelson. \"The money that comes into the community but certainly it's not enough.\"\nNelson said it would take at least $60 million to help, double the amount of the Flint Water Relief Bill signed by Snyder.\nFlint Mayor Karen Weaver said the bill is a step in the \"right direction\" but she also stressed the need for more resources to cover the city's water bill debt.\n\"We look forward to continuing dialogue and negotiations with the Governor in effort to bring the additional resources needed to resuscitate our city,\" Weaver said.\nFlint water customers will get a 65 percent credit on their water bills for paying for water they could not consume.\nThe bill comes nearly two years after Flint residents were exposed to lead tainted water after switching from Detroit to the Flint River for their water supply. In September 2015 it was discovered by Hurley Medical Center doctors that children in Flint that had consumed the water had elevated lead levels since the switch.\nThe bill is to relieve residents for water bills stemming from April 2014 to April 2016, Snyder said during an announcement at the Riverfront Banquet Center in downtown Flint.\nThe average water bill for city of Flint residents is $140, the highest in Genesee County. Snyder said they used a formula to calculate what the water portion of resident bills are from April 2014 to April 2016 and this will be the portion where a 65 percent credit could be applied.\nNo shut off notices have been issued since December and no disconnections of service for nonpayment have occurred since Aug. 7.\nBefore customers see a water bill credit Snyder said they must make arrangements to pay outstanding sewer and waste fees. Monthly water bills show charges for both water and sewer systems.\n\"We want to give them the benefit of the credit but this is to cover the 65 percent of their water piece,\" Snyder said.\nA number of clergy and community leaders contend that Snyder has \"no sense of urgency\" in the Flint water crisis and the bill isn't really going to help residents.\n\"They are concerned about the long term finances of the city,\" Snyder said. \"So am I but first let's deal with this water credit deal and then we can always talk about other issues.\"\nAs of Friday officials did not have a specific timeline but an email from Weaver's Director of Public Relations, Kristin Moore, said residents may see credits on their bills as soon as three weeks."}

But was the murder of Supreme Leader Snoke a mere accident? Director Rian Johnson has revealed that Kylo had every intention to kill the villain in the celebrated throne room scene.\nIn Star Wars 8, Rey decided to go to Kylo Ren after they were connected by the Force several times. Kylo promptly brought her to Supreme Leader Snoke but not before the two had a tense conversation. The exchange resulted in Kylo using his grandfather\u2019s lightsaber to cut his mentor in half, but the death of Snoke was not a rash decision. According to Rian Johnson, Kylo had been waiting for that moment since the beginning of The Last Jedi.\nIn an interview with Collider, the director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi revealed that Kylo Ren had already decided that he is done with Snoke before bringing Rey to the Supreme Leader. However, the former Ben Solo was still uncertain how he was going to get away with the betrayal.\nRian Johnson also adds that the Supreme Leader\u2019s biggest mistake was placing Rey\u2019s weapon beside him because Kylo Ren \u201csees that opportunity with that lightsaber next to him\u201d and takes advantage when Snoke was distracted. Needless to say, the murder of the Supreme Leader then led to an epic fight against the Elite Praetorian Guards in Star Wars 8.\nThe throne room fight is undoubtedly the most memorable action sequence in The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson credits both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver for the scene.

Almost all of this stuff comes from people who clearly have never even looked at this website or paid any attention to what we do here. For example, publicists and writers constantly offer to send us religious-market books so that we can review them for our readers.\nOK, raise your hand if you have ever read a book review on this weblog, a review written by a GetReligion scribe (let alone a book full of, let's say, Bible commentaries or born-again testimonies).\nThere should be no hands up at this stage, because we don't write book reviews. We have -- I could probably count them on one hand -- written a few posts about reviews of books that have been published in mainstream news publications. We do this if we think these books and reviews would be of interest to professional journalists who cover news linked to religion.\nWe also get waves of PR emails about denominational events and the activities -- left and right -- of groups that blend faith and political activism.\nOne of the most active public-relations groups in this field, on the religious right, holds itself up as a kind of religion-news agency -- Christian Newswire. Many of these PR releases simply promote the views of this or that author of church leader, with the hopes that journalists will call them up and get a quotation or what not.\nIt seems that I spike about 100 emails from this group a day, most of them unopened.\nMeeting at General Synod 28 in Tampa, Florida this weekend -- July 1-5, 2011 -- the historic United Church of Christ will vote on an amendment to eliminate God the Father from Article 5, lines 9-10 of its constitution (pdf).\nThe Constitution of the denomination has remained unchanged in its theological core since the United Church of Christ's founding in 1957, and remains the covenant connection with the basic truths of Christianity that keeps many churches affiliated who are otherwise alienated by the denominations very liberal agenda.\nAccording to renewal leader David Runnion-Bareford, \"Rejecting God as Father in an age of fatherlessness is unthinkable. God acted toward us in amazing grace when He offered to be our Father through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ who offers us life in his name. This is not something we as humans made up in some other time. Rejecting our Father is act of arrogant rebellion in the name of cultural conformity that only further alienates members, churches, but more importantly God himself. We call the delegates to reject the change for God's sake.\"\nYou get the picture. This is a small, vocal conservative group that continues to struggle inside the boundaries of the super Congregationalist and freewheeling United Church of Christ, the small, declining, yet vocal denomination that represents the left edge of the old mainline Protestant world.\nSo is this a mainstream news story? I would say that it is, since editing the ancient Christian creeds is a highly symbolic act -- even for flocks as hyper-Protestant as the UCC. Of course, this denomination also serves as the home base for a very articulate and important layperson -- President Barack Obama.\nBut is this a mainstream news story?

It is also rising dangerously in Ukraine, where more than 1,300 cases were reported in the first 10 months of last year, and cases are being reported in other former republics of the Soviet Union.\nFirst reported mostly in Russia's largest cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, which have more than 650 registered cases each, the disease is now showing up in the more distant regions, where doctors are even less likely to give a prompt and effective diagnosis, experts say.\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious disease, transmitted by airborne bacteria, that may be spread in particles and produces a toxin that causes an inflammation of the heart and nervous system. Untreated, it progresses rapidly and can be fatal in a short period of time. Doctors say the initial symptoms are commonly confused with angina, or inflammation of the throat and chest.\nMost experts attribute the increase in diphtheria to failings in the Russian immunization program, which allows a high number of infants to be turned down for the normal schedule of inoculations for medical reasons, while not keeping many adults, particularly those from age 20 to 50, up to date on their immunizations.\nBut doctors also say the situation has been worsened by the social and economic upheavals that have sent thousands of people migrating across the former Soviet Union and slowed down the response of the health authorities to an increasing crisis.\n\"People are on the move, mostly from the areas where the conflicts are,\" said the City of Moscow's chief epidemiologist, Igor A. Andreyev. \"There is more mixing of the populations, and more carriers -- drifters, people who live in the subway tunnels. It is part of the social problems created by the country's collapse, by the lack of social and political stability.\"\nThe number of cases is also on the rise, but at a slower rate, in the neighboring countries of Lithuania, Moldova and Belarus. In Belarus, 13 new cases were reported last year in one city alone, for a nationwide total of 44, W.H.O. figures show.\nIn other countries the number of cases is relatively insignificant. Altogether, the former republics of the Soviet Union account for more than 90 percent of all the diphtheria cases in Europe, Mr. Oblapenko said. The last big outbreak in Europe occurred in Sweden in the 1970's, he said, but then the number of cases never surpassed 20.\nIn most developed countries, children are immunized at an early age, with booster shots administered regularly until the age of 12 or so. Dr. Myles Druckman, chief medical doctor at the American Medical Center in Moscow, said adults in the United States were fully immunized, given the thoroughness of the American system of inoculations.

In the fall of 2003, when he was a sophomore at Harvard, a disciplinary body called the Ad Board summoned him to answer questions about Facemash, the Facebook precursor that he had just released. Using I.D. photos of female undergraduates scraped from the university\u2019s online directories, Facemash presented users with pairs of women and asked them to rank who was \u201chotter.\u201d (\u201cWere we let in for our looks? No,\u201d the site proclaimed. \u201cWill we be judged on them? Yes.\u201d) By 10 P.M. on the day Facemash launched, some four hundred and fifty visitors had cast at least twenty-two thousand votes. Several student groups, including Fuerza Latina and the Harvard Association of Black Women, led an outcry. But Zuckerberg insisted to the Ad Board that he had not intended to \u201cinsult\u201d anyone. As the student newspaper, the Crimson, reported, \u201cThe programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg\u2019s primary interest in creating it.\u201d The point of Facemash was to make a tool. The fact that it got sharpened on the faces of fellow-students was incidental.\nThe ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good.\nTool talk encodes an entire attitude to politics\u2014namely, a rejection of politics in favor of tinkering. In the sixties, Brand and the \u201cWhole Earth Catalog\u201d presented tools as an alternative to activism. Unlike his contemporaries in the antiwar, civil-rights, and women\u2019s movements, Brand was not interested in gender, race, class, or imperialism. The transformations that he sought were personal, not political. In defining the purpose of the \u201cCatalog,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca realm of intimate, personal power is developing\u2014power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.\u201d Like Zuckerberg, Brand saw tools as a neutral means to engage any and every user. \u201cWhole Earth eschewed politics and pushed grassroots direct power\u2014tools and skills,\u201d he later wrote. If people got good enough tools to build the communities they wanted, politics would take care of itself.\nFor decades, the American public has largely embraced this optimistic, laissez-faire ideology. But a tech backlash has been building steam since the 2016 Presidential election, and especially since the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political-consulting firm connected with Donald Trump, surreptitiously harvested the data of eighty-seven million Facebook users. On Tuesday, senators directly challenged the idea that Facebook could ever be a \u201cneutral platform.\u201d It remains to be seen whether American politicians and the American public will accept Zuckerberg\u2019s can-do talk of technical solutions\u2014or whether they will dismiss him as a tool himself.\nMoira Weigel is a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and a founding editor of Logic, a magazine about technology.\nIt is an open secret in Washington that Congress will have little say in how the law around privacy and technology will be written. It will be mostly up to Zuckerberg and his peers in the tech industry."}

In between, there's a fantastic tale, and a vision of a rabbit. And yes, until recently, the place you'd be most likely to witness all this would be in Richard Kelly's excellent movie Donnie Darko.\nLately, though, it's become difficult not to recognise that an individual hearing epic and adventurous pop music of the 1980s wherever they go might not necessarily be such a far-fetched idea.\nThe vocal inflections of the Cure's Robert Smith in the music of the Rapture and Hot Hot Heat. The grand and cinematic guitar epics of Echo And The Bunnymen in the excellent album by the Stills, or material by the Open or Longview. The intelligent and funky avant rock of Gang Of Four or Japan in the likes of Franz Ferdinand. Even in No Doubt's recent cover version of Talk Talk's magnificent It's My Life.\nTo some, dry ice will forever remain frozen carbon dioxide, that versatile refrigerant. To the 1980s rock band, however, it and its cousin the smoke machine helped to plunge the audience into a state of personal disorientation as great as that of the band they had come to see. A theatrical masterstroke, it additionally brought to the student union of the incumbent provincial university a flavour of the Mekong Delta. \"I like to think it was the songs that made this band,\" said Andrew Eldritch from the Sisters Of Mercy. \"I know it wasn't. We used a lot of smoke, and made a space where you could lose yourself.\"\nBeneath the long overcoats, discontent was often simmering in the 1980s band. With drugs and egomania holding them ransom in 1987, for example, Echo And The Bunnymen once flew their US management across America to arbitrate between them. Fried on psychedelic drugs during the sessions for their third album, Julian Cope chased Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe (later boss of Food Records and subject of Blur's Country House) across the Welsh countryside with a shotgun. King of feuds, however, was to be found in the Cure, between singer Robert Smith and former schoolfriend Lol Tolhurst. Asked why he victimised his drummer/keyboard player, Smith replied: \"Because he's so useless.\"\nIf existence precedes essence, it certainly never did so as convincingly as when accompanied by guitars. In 1979, the Cure's first single Killing An Arab provided a condensed version of the Camus story The Outsider, while in the 1980s they persevered gamely, taking the essential tenets of dread and anxiety with them wherever they went. Echo And The Bunnymen, meanwhile, took the ideas of personal freedom and commitment to the next level. \"This reaching beyond your grasp, self against the universe-type theme,\" says Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips, \"was, to me, what the band embodied all along.\"\nOn the cusp of the late 1970s and early 1980s, a lot of kudos could be gained by presenting oneself not as a pop group, but as much like a citizen of an eastern bloc country as was possible without actually having to wear a headscarf and queue for vegetables.

{"idx": "23034", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Queens Road north of West Sixth Street is shown in this file photo from April 2017.\nA buyer signs up to 150 pages of documents when closing on a home, and among the multitude of notices can be an agreement to pay significant sums to the city. After a contentious debate about the $5.3 million Queens Road benefit districts, city leaders have questions about whether such agreements can be more forthright in the future.\nThe recently created Queens Road benefit districts will add thousands to the tax bills of residential and commercial property owners in the area, and many said they were not aware they had agreed not to protest the benefit districts. Even though the no-protest agreement would have been included in closing documents, those familiar with the closing process say they are not surprised.\nThe Queens Road benefit districts are not unique. The City of Lawrence commonly uses benefit districts to pay for infrastructure, such as streets, sewers and water lines, in new developments. Queens Road joins about seven other areas with active benefit districts, according to city maps, and dozens more have collected funds throughout the years.\nThere are two benefit districts that together fund the $5.3 million cost of the road, from Sixth Street to Eisenhower Drive, and intersection improvements.\nWhat makes the Queens Road benefit districts stand out is that their formation has been pushed down the road for years, spanning multiple commissions. Developers made agreements not to protest the benefit districts years ago when the neighborhoods were planned, and those agreements run with the land and would be included on titles and other paperwork. The first no-protest agreements for Queens Road date back 18 years, and many homeowners told the commission they were not aware of the no-protest agreement when they bought their homes.\nBrada said that though some homeowners have said real estate agents mentioned the potential for benefit districts in the future, details were not known about when the districts would be formed or how much they could add to homeowners\u2019 tax bills. She said many homeowners were not aware that the no-protest agreement means homeowners automatically consent to all future benefit districts, nor of the cost that could bring.\nAfter a lengthy and contentious debate about the Queens Road benefit districts, the commission approved the districts earlier this month. Mayor Stuart Boley and Vice Mayor Lisa Larsen said at that time they wanted to ensure those involved with home sales are more upfront about benefit districts going forward.\nThe years-long debate about the benefit districts likely did little to clarify the issue for all involved. The Queens Road benefit districts came up multiple times over the years, and the discussion included at times ideas to increase the city\u2019s share of the costs and to expand the benefit districts\u2019 boundaries so the costs would be shared among more property owners. At one point along the way, past commissioners took the position that the city at large would pick up the costs for the homeowners. However, none of that discussion changed the fact that the no-protest agreements exist.\nApart from benefit districts and no-protest agreements, there are other things buyers should be aware of. Those include easements for utilities, drainage or sidewalks that may restrict what a homeowner can build over the easement. The city may also own rights-of-way that allow for widening roadways in the future. Also potentially included, though more likely in the case of rural properties, is information about mineral rights, which could allow whoever owns those rights to drill an oil well next to the property.\nWestwood Hills resident Tom Sack said he and his wife bought their home this summer.

The wasp suit is basically an ant suit with wings and blasters. Scott is hilariously put out that he didn\u2019t get any blasters and has to ride a flying ant, whereas the winged wasp suit can flit about on its own.\nSo, Scott\u2019s been under house arrest for two years, sporting an FBI ankle bracelet, which neatly explains why he was missing from \u201cInfinity War.\u201d Meanwhile, Hank has figured out that Scott\u2019s brave foray into the quantum realm (in the first movie) is most likely the answer to finding his long-lost wife, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer).\nJanet, a scientist on par with Hank, disappeared down in the microcosm almost a lifetime ago. So Hank and Hope rig a dimension-hopping vehicle to navigate the quantum realm to go find her.

Cable said other plaintiffs or defendants could potentially be joined in the suit, including the Massachusetts National Guard.\nThe Domestic Cannabis Eradication and Suppression Program, in place since 1989, is funded with a combination of state and federal dollars. The Massachusetts National Guard provides helicopters with trained personnel to conduct surveillance, and the Massachusetts State Police puts troopers on the ground, authorities have confirmed. Guardsmen also take part in the ground crew operation to help cut plants.\nA helicopter hovered at close range, and soon five men made off with 10 plants grown by two prominent residents of Wendell, a Western Massachusetts hilltown in Franklin County known for its alternative ethos.\n\"They came onto lawful citizens' land and seized property with no probable cause, no search warrant, no satisfactory exception to the search warrant requirement,\" said Cable in a statement. \"This is what our nation's founders were seeking to avoid.

The improvement project is one of more than 50 home repair efforts CHC has planned throughout the county this summer to fulfill its mission keeping Madison residents in safe, affordable housing.\n\u201cThe social and financial benefits of people being able to age in place cannot be overstated,\u201d Chris Watson, CHC\u2019s client and grants coordinator explained in an email.\nBacked by funding from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, as well as donations from the church groups serving on the project, CHC made more than $6,000 in repairs to Whittington\u2019s roof and porches \u2013 repairs that she likely would not have been able to afford. \u201cCHC\u2019s work is unique in that it nearly doubles the impact of these program dollars by leveraging an amazing network of volunteers and their in-kind contributions,\u201d Watson said.\nFor Jeff Brown, the director of campus outreach of Shady Side Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, volunteering with CHC underscores the importance of helping others. \u201cI hope she knows that she's cared for and that we're here for her, not her house,\u201d he said as he put together trusses for Whittington\u2019s new roof.\nShady Side has sent groups of teen and adult volunteers to Madison County to team with CHC for about 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s really important our young guys come away with heart of service and know it\u2019s essential in their life to be caring for other people.

{"idx": "23047", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The symmetrical barrel cactus is crowned in bold flowers in May.\nBarrel cactus, members of the genera Ferocactus and Enchinocactus, is an tidy addition to an arid garden in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. These orderly, symmetrical cacti can function as focal anchors when placed in the right location in the landscape. Sometimes, though, you may need to move your barrel cactus or dig immature shoots produced by a barrel cactus in a friend's garden. Digging barrel cacti, be they adult or juvenile, is a simple process.\nStop watering a landscape cactus several weeks before you intend to dig it to induce a type of dormancy that makes transplantation easier. Mark the north side of the plant with chalk immediately prior to digging so that you can reorient the cactus if you will be replanting it.\nDig a circle around the barrel cactus about 6 inches from the edge of the plant, pushing straight down into the soil to preserve as much of the root as possible. Use your shovel to gently pry the cactus loose from the surrounding soil.\nTie a garden hose around the barrel cactus and gently pull up on the hose to lift the cactus from the hole and place the cactus in a wheelbarrow; lay the cactus on its side so the roots don't get damaged. Wheel the cactus to a shady spot to allow any damaged areas to dry out slowly and prevent sunburn. Trim the damaged roots and allow the cactus roots to dry for several days if you intend to replant the barrel cactus.\nMark the side of the pup facing away from the mother plant with chalk and note the direction it's facing so you can replant the cactus in the same orientation in the future.\nSlide the blade of a sharp spade carefully between the pup you intend to dig and the mother plant. Push the spade into the ground behind the pup to separate it from the mother.\nDig around the pup, plunging your spade straight down into the ground to preserve as many roots as possible. Carefully dig around the plant, leaving about 6 inches of space around the plant where possible.\nGrab the pup through several layers of newspaper. Gently rock it back and forth and pull upward to dislodge it. Use your spade to leverage the bottom if it does not come loose readily. Set the pup aside a few days to dry.\nIf you are digging your cacti to remove them permanently, first try calling nurseries that sell the cactus you're removing. Sometimes nursery workers will come and remove the plant for free to resell to another homeowner.\nTake great caution when moving mature specimens since they can be deceptively heavy -- an 18-inch barrel cactus may weight upward of 80 pounds.\nWaterworth, Kristi. \"How to Dig a Barrel Cactus.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/dig-barrel-cactus-38751.html.

Texas will need able representation in all arenas in that shifting legislative environment.\nIt will be especially important for Texans to have a strong, respected voice inside the expected Democratic majority in the Senate. Rick Noriega offers such a voice, with a distinctive Lone Star tone and perspective. The Chronicle endorses Noriega for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican John Cornyn.\nNoriega, a Houstonian, describes himself as a Texas Democrat. That term, once common currency in the state's political conversation, seems to have fallen out of favor over the past several Republican-dominated years. But it resonates once more in this season of voter discontent with partisanship uber alles. Some old-fashioned moderate bipartisanship, Texas style, should be much welcomed in the Washington debate, particularly on overheated topics such as energy and immigration. Rick Noriega can provide it.\nNoriega well understands that there are subjects on which Texas Democrats must stand apart from the party's national leadership. Energy is one. He is committed to bringing the message that the nation will need new domestic oil and gas supplies as it builds a bridge to greater energy independence and increased reliance on alternative energy sources. He will be able to point out in a forceful and personal way the folly of relying almost exclusively on hurricane-prone areas of the Gulf for supplies when abundant reserves can be tapped on the East and West coasts with little risk to the environment.\nOn immigration, Noriega is in step with traditional Texas views of tolerance and a warm embrace of cultural differences, rooted in respect for the law. He will bring calm and reason to the national debate.\nAs his role model for senatorial conduct, Noriega has selected the late Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. When facing difficult decisions in the Senate, Noriega says he would ask the question, \"What would Lloyd Bentsen do?\" This is more than a catchy slogan or a nostalgia trip: As a North Star for conduct and policy judgment, Noriega could scarcely choose truer than Bentsen.\nOur decision to support Noriega was not made without due consideration of Cornyn's strengths. The one-term incumbent has been a strong and reliable supporter of freedom of information and open government laws. And he worked to speed up the citizenship process for immigrants serving in the military. But John Cornyn also has been a too-loyal foot soldier for the Bush administration, willing to make a right turn off the cliff in support of fatally flawed policies on Iraq and torture, as well as casting improvident votes on a host of social issues. Unlike Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, he is not known for his attention to constituent services.\nOver the years, Noriega has worked his way up through the ranks. He has distinguished himself as a soldier in Afghanistan and on the Texas-Mexico border, and as an elected official in Austin. During Hurricane Ike, he performed duty above and beyond the call helping those in need at the George R. Brown Convention Center. He richly deserves a promotion to Washington.\nNoriega is showing himself to be the model of an effective Democrat \u2014 a centrist, moderate Texas Democrat \u2014 in a time when most voters are sick of political extremes. As such, he may one day set the standard for what a strong Texas senator can be.\nThe Senate seat contested"}

This team has turned it into an art form. If we have learned nothing else this season, take whatever it says about the state of an injured player and add at least 20 percent more pain. That\u2019s just good business.\nThus, when the Falcons report that running back Devonta Freeman will miss a minimum of eight games following groin surgery, experience tells me to assume he is lost for the season.\nFreeman and his ever-expanding medical file have moved to the forefront of the conversation about how much is too much to invest in a running back. Especially a 209-pound running back who carries the ball with the attitude of a 250-pound fullback. As the dental tool with sledgehammer ambitions, Freeman deserves credit.\nIt was shortly after Freeman and his agent made pre-Super Bowl noises about wanting a big new contract \u2013 and after he rushed for 75 yards, one touchdown and whiffed on one important block at the end of that game \u2013 that the Falcons obliged. Gave him $41.5 million over five years. Went all in with Freeman while allowing his talented backfield partner Tevin Coleman to play out his rookie deal through this season.\nWhat followed has been the kind of injury-plagued, halting output by Freeman that critics of the deal warned us about. In 2017, the two-time Pro Bowl dual-threat back suffered a pair of concussions and was slowed by a knee sprain come the postseason. With reported knee pain, he appeared in only two games this season (14 carries, 68 yards) before we learned of the groin injury.\nThe Falcons run game \u2013 ranking 29th in the NFL in yards per game \u2013 has suffered. And lest you believe the rush is unimportant in this aerodynamic age, the team was fifth-best running the ball in 2016, the Super Bowl season. Yeah, it matters.\nIn this injury-cursed season, the news of Freeman\u2019s impending surgery was among the least shocking developments, because doing without him has, regretfully, become the new normal. It could remain that way. The ground isn\u2019t getting any softer. And so much of his pay will count against the Falcons salary cap for at least two seasons yet that there is no simple way to move on if the injuries keep compounding. This is a real pickle, although front office types might employ a choicer word or two.\nWe\u2019re not quite at the worst possible scenario yet, but you can see it from here. The suspicions that the Falcons were over-committing to a running back \u2013 given the wear and tear of the position and Freeman\u2019s size and running style \u2013 are beginning to set up and cure like concrete.\nThere is one anomaly at work, make of it what you will. The site Last Word on Sports looked at the Falcons 24 games since the start of the 2017 season \u2013 17 of them in which Freeman played significant snaps, seven he didn\u2019t.\nThe Falcons haven\u2019t rushed the ball as well without Freeman (2.9 yards per carry) as with him (4.2 yards per carry).

Heavy, bulky and requiring light-bulb-sized flashbulbs to shoot at night, a Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high-school yearbook and the paper I worked for part-time while in high school and college.\nThe one in my office used sheet film -- you\u2019d take a shot, pull out the sheet holder, put in another.

{"idx": "23065", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In 2014, the major trends in the Russian oil and gas sector were primarily influenced by sanctions imposed by foreign governments earlier in the year. In particular, the sanctions limited access of domestic companies to goods and services necessary for deep water oil exploration and production, Arctic oil exploration or production and shale oil projects in Russia. This development has had a devastating effect on a number of Russian shelf projects.\nPrior to this, domestic and international majors negotiated several ambitious joint ventures and the Russian government made substantial efforts to bring the Russian legal framework closer to existing international practice. At the end of 2013, the first substantial amendments were introduced to Russian legislation to recognize the concept of an operator of a shelf project. In the summer of 2014, Rosneft and ExxonMobil started exploratory drilling in the Kara Sea. However the sanctions have prevented them from pursuing the project further.\nA number of major Russian companies have repeatedly declared their intention to challenge the sanctions. Among them Rosneft and Sberbank have already submitted their claims. A claim was also brought by the well known Russian businessman, Arkady Rotenberg.\nAccording to the website of the European Court of Justice (the ECJ), Rosneft, Sberbank and Mr. Rotenberg filed claims in October 2014 against the Council of the European Union, the EU institution responsible for imposing EU restrictive measures. However, information on the website is currently very limited and does not disclose particulars of the claims.\nThe resolution of the claim will obviously have a material effect on Russian companies subject to the sanctions. It is especially relevant to Russian oil and gas companies.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the outcome of this claim, there have been precedents when the ECJ did not uphold sanctions introduced by the Council of the European Union. For example, in 2013 the Iranian Bank Mellat successfully challenged the Council of the European Union's sanctions against it (which were part of a wide package of sanctions against Iran). The bank persuaded the ECJ in the first instance that there were no material grounds for the sanctions against it. This judgement is currently being appealed before the ECJ by the Council of the European Union.\nRussian oil and gas majors have been looking increasingly toward the east. In May, Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a 30 year contract for annual gas supplies of 38 bcm via the eastern route. In September, construction of the Power of Siberia transportation pipeline in Siberia commenced, through which the gas supplies will be routed. In November, these two majors signed a framework agreement on gas supplies via the western route. Rosneft is also negotiating with CNPC regarding its participation in the largest Vankor field. In November, it was reported in the media that Indian companies are also being invited to participate in a number of Russian projects, including in the Arctic and East Siberia.\nHowever, the Russian-Chinese agreement on the Power of Siberia has caused some tension between the major Russian oil and gas producers. While Gazprom claims to be the sole operator of the new pipeline, Rosneft is trying to secure access to its future available capacity. Under Russian law, Gazprom, while acting as the sole operator of the Russian gas transportation system, cannot refuse granting access to the transportation system to other, so-called 'independent', gas producers (including Rosneft), provided that it is technically possible.\nA similar issue was raised with regard to Sakhalin-2. Rosneft is currently trying to gain access to the project's gas transportation pipeline which"}

{"idx": "23067", "prompt": "Continue the following text: SSD vs HDD: What's the difference between flash storage and traditional hard drives?\n- What are the differences between flash and traditional hard drives? And which one should you pick?\nPick up an internal or external drive for your computer today and your choice is between a solid-state drive (SSD) and a more traditional hard disk drive (HDD). So what are the differences? And which one should you pick?\nHere we'll explain the ins and outs of SSD and HDD technology in simple terms, so you know exactly what they entail, whether you're actually buying one or just want to be more clued up on the technology.\nIt's the \"solid\" bit that's the key term in SSD: these drives are made up from fixed flash memory that has no moving parts, like the storage inside a smartphone or USB stick (it's not exactly the same technology, but it's similar). Access to data is controlled by an integrated processor built into the drive.\nA classic HDD, meanwhile, uses rapidly spinning, circular platters and a read-write head that physically moves across them, scanning for the right pieces of data as they're needed \u2013 that's all the whirring you can hear when your computer's disk is busy.\nWhile the newer SSD technology offers a lot of benefits over the older HDDs (see below), until recently it's been significantly more expensive for the same amount of storage. That's starting to change, which is why more and more laptops and desktops now come with SSDs installed.\nSSDs are now typically used inside most laptops and high-performance desktops, because of their advantages. In other cases, like external drives, HDDs are still more popular, though SSD options are available too.\nSpeed is the main benefit of an SSD, which can work perhaps twice as fast an HDD \u2013 the exact speed bump really depends what you're doing with your computer at the time, and how you're accessing your data.\nData needs to be written to and from disk on a constant basis, so whether you're opening apps, encoding video, browsing the web or listening to music, you should notice everything goes faster with an SSD installed.\nSome computers use a small SSD holding the operating system alongside an HDD for general storage, because boot up times are so much faster with the solid-state technology. Upgrade an older HDD to a newer SSD, and the difference is noticeable.\nIf you want the fastest computer that money can buy then you need one with an SSD inside it, though bear in mind that the hard drive is only one component, and it can get held back if the other internal hardware isn't up to the same level.\nWith no moving parts, SSDs are also more durable than HDDs, should you happen to knock your laptop off the table on to the floor. They tend to stay operational for longer, though they do have a finite number of read/write cycles in them (these cycles will usually last years, so you don't have to worry too much about them).\nSSDs are also more compact too, which has made them the perfect choice as laptops have continued to get slimmer and slimmer. What's more, they're also less of a power draw than HDDs, which means your laptop battery lasts for longer.\nSo with all these positives for SSDs, why are the older HDDs still around? Two reasons: storage capacity and price. You can get traditional hard disk drives with much more storage on them (think 4TB and higher), whereas solid-state drives tend to struggle at that limit"}

But there are a few things that you should never share with HR.\nThe key is to be mindful: \"You need to be sure you are communicating what you want your management to know,\" says Clinical Professor of Management John Millikin, Ph.D. of the W.P. Carey School of Business.\nIf you're concerned but still think HR should know something, ask for discretion: \"It is up to you to communicate what you want to be kept confidential. Like any relationship, you should build trust slowly,\" suggests Millikin.\nHR is there to help you deal with your manager, but they're also there to help your manager deal with you, so don't count on privacy.\n\"HR works in that difficult space between employees and management, and must act on serious issues they learn about, whether you want them to act or not. Go to HR for help in solving problems, but not as a substitute for a best friend or neighbor,\" says Bruce Clarke, president and CEO of CAI, a human resource management firm.\nYour HR staff is tasked with keeping your work life well and functioning -- your home life isn't usually their business.\nThis includes \"medical conditions, whether it be personal or family ongoing or past physical or mental issues...or financial issues like foreclosure,\" notes Lauren MacArthur, CPC and Partner, at Winter, Wyman & Co. a Northeast staffing firm.\nThe reason? HR wants stable performers and may be concerned if aspects of your home life seem unstable. Of course, if you need their help in order to do your job because of these issues, then you may need to discuss them, but do so cautiously.\nAt some point during hiring or after, your HR rep may check out your online profile just to make sure you're not bashing the company online or acting in a way that reflects them poorly.\nSo it goes without saying to never post inappropriate or potentially offensive photos, videos, wall posts, updates, or other content on Facebook or other social networks.\n\"Even when your privacy settings are tight, you never know who might see your profile,\" says Holly Paul, the U.S. Recruiting Leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nIf your company gave you maternity or paternity leave, mention how much you appreciated it to HR -- but show them that you've integrated back in and are glad to be back. The same goes when discussing a past leave in a job interview.\n\"You don't want to dwell on why you took any leave (parental or otherwise) because it's not relevant, and you want to move on to what's relevant\" -- like your current skills and experience, says Caroline Ceniza-Levine, Partner, Six-Figure Start and co-author of How the Fierce Handle Fear; Secrets to Succeeding in Challenging Times.\nWhat else is none of your HR rep's business?

{"idx": "23080", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Pinterest, the social networking company that popularized virtual pinboards, recently released the prospectus for its upcoming IPO. The company, which was valued at $12.3 billion after its last funding round, plans to debut on the NYSE under the ticker \"PINS\" in April. Let's take a look at the six key numbers from Pinterest's filing.\nPinterest's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 6% sequentially and 23% annually to 265 million during the fourth quarter. For comparison, Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) MAUs dipped 2% sequentially to 321 million in its latest quarter, as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) MAUs rose 2% sequentially to 2.32 billion.\nPinterest is growing at a faster rate than those bigger platforms, but it doesn't necessarily compete against them. Unlike Twitter, where users share and react to news, or Facebook, where users share content with friends and family, Pinterest enables users to pin things and ideas (like outfits, recipes, and products) that they like.\nPinterest monetizes its users through ads, which are naturally pinned across a user's feed. Pinterest revenue rose 58% annually to $273 million during that quarter, and 60% to $755.9 million for the full year.\nIts revenue from the United States rose 58% annually during the quarter and accounted for 94% of its top line. Pinterest's growth rate in the US market is impressive compared to that of many other social networks. Twitter, for example, grew its US revenue just 24% annually to $506 million last quarter. However, Pinterest's heavy dependence on the US market raises questions about its ability to expand overseas if its domestic growth decelerates.\nPinterest's ARPU (average revenue per user) improved 25% annually to $3.14 in 2018. In the fourth quarter, its ARPU grew 28% annually to $1.06. Yet that's much lower than the average ARPU for other major social networks. Facebook, for comparison, grew its global ARPU 19% annually to $7.37 last quarter.\nIf Pinterest's losses continue to narrow at that rate, it could become profitable in the near future. Furthermore, it isn't heavily dependent on stock bonuses. Its stock-based compensation expenses accounted for less than 2% of its revenue in 2018, but that percentage could rise after its public offering.\nMeanwhile, an Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) study of retail transactions from 2016 to 2017 (cited in the prospectus) indicated that Pinterest households were 39% more likely to buy retail products and spent 29% more than the average household.\nThose numbers highlight Pinterest's niche advantage in the nascent market for social shopping experiences, which Facebook, Instagram, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are all targeting with experimental platforms. That's why Pinterest recently allowed companies to upload their entire catalogs to its platform.\nLastly, Pinterest's offering will be a dual-class offering, in which \"co-founders, executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates\" will receive super-voting Class B shares worth 20 votes each. During the IPO, investors will be sold Class A shares worth one vote each.\nThis means that it will be very difficult (and"}

Abortion is about conversion and it's very hard to convert people in masses, and that is why people like Youth Defence go out into the street.\"\nThe matter was thrust back into the forefront of public discourse following the death of Indian Dr. Savita Halappanavar, who died from septicaemia and E.coli ESBL in a Galway hospital after being denied an abortion. Savita\u2019s husband says that doctors told her that Ireland was a Catholic country, and abortions were not permitted.\nSince then, protests and rallies have reignited calling for both change in abortion legislation, as well as for the existing legislation to remain untouched.\nNagle writes how in December, the Irish government, feeling public pressure, revealed plans to loosen abortion legislation, making it permissible for mothers whose lives are threatened by the pregnancy. The proposed legislation is a small step, but still had public support.\nHowever, the new legislation would only affect a fraction of the Irish women who seek abortions every year. While some seek abortion because it threatens their lives, others opt for it as a means to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\nWith abortion being outlawed in Ireland, women need to travel to England to have an abortion, or risk the chance of buying abortion pills online, which are often detained by customs in transit.\nInterestingly, public opinion poll in Ireland does appear to favor the option of abortion for women. A Sunday Business Post/Red C Poll found that 85 percent of people surveyed supported legislation for the X case, which would allow abortion where a woman's life is threatened, including by suicide.\nArmed with that statistic, Nagle writes \"The fact that Youth Defence has been able to impose their will more effectively than the Irish people or the European Court of Human Rights for so long is testament to the power of their enormously well-funded campaigns.\"\nNow over twenty years old, Youth Defence is known for their \u201cshocking, enlarged poster images of aborted fetuses that they regularly display on Dublin's main thoroughfare and at stalls and demonstrations around the country,\u201d writes Nagle."}

One hundred years ago.\nOn December 12, 1911 it was formally announced at the Delhi Durbar that Delhi would henceforth be the capital of British India.\nThe 1911 Durbar, the third of its kind, was held probably at the peak of British imperial glory in India. It cost the British government in India upwards of a million pounds and took a long year of preparations.\nIt marked the coronation of George V and was the very first visit of a British monarch to Indian soil; they arrived by ship through the Gateway of India in Mumbai. The very regal and decorous George V and his queen, Mary of Teck graced the occasion. They were proclaimed Emperor and Empress.\nAt this Durbar the British king made public the surprising and historic decision to make Delhi the capital and the foundation stone for Delhi was laid three days later. \"We are pleased to announce to Our People that on the advice of Our Ministers tendered after consultation with Our Governor-General in Council, We have decided upon the transfer of the seat of the Government of India from Calcutta to the ancient Capital Delhi...\"\nPomp and ceremony were at their height at the 1911 Durbar. And an occasion of such circumstance was never again see in India.\nWhen George V, who was wearing his ornate maroon and ermine coronation robes and a special imperial crown, arrived at the Durbar at noon on that chilly day in December a 101-gun salute was fired. Some 200,000 people, Indians and Britishers, were expected to attend the Durbar. And another half million people journeyed to the Red Fort for a darshan with the royal couple from a window (jharoka) of the fort.\nThe king's nearly one kilo heavy crown -- he later complained it gave him a headache -- contained over 6,000 diamonds apart from rubies, emeralds and sapphires and was created by the famous London Crown Jewellers, Garrard & Co. It was the only British crown to leave the shores of Britain and cost 60,000 pounds then and is today (it rests in the Tower of London and was never worn again) valued at 4.5 million pounds.\nGeorge V wore the crown into the Durbar and was not crowned at the Durbar because the then Archbishop of Canterbury did not feel that a Christian monarch should be coronated in a Christian service in a predominantly non-Christian land.\nIndia's most important princes, some 600 of them, including the Maharaja of Mysore, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Gaekwad of Baroda, the Maharaja of Kashmir, the Begum of Bhopal (the only woman ruler) were part of the Durbar.\nPresent too were 20,000 soldiers, all the representatives of British India including Viceroy Charles Hardinge and his wife, the most important regional Indian chieftains and noblemen and zamindars, top British generals as well as gigantic flotillas of elephants, horses and camels.\nThe rajahs came in their ornamental best.

So for the past two weeks, the minority leader has paralyzed the work of the Senate,\" he charged.\nRubio thinks there's another reason at play in Senate Democrats blocking the bill.\n\"I think they're blocking it because they're afraid of radical elements in their own base,\" said Rubio. \"There's a growing group of people in the Democratic Party that are anti-Israel, openly, and I think they're afraid of them.\"\nSen."}

Recently, the federal government launched its regulatory effort to allow oil and gas leasing in the refuge's 1.6-million-acre coastal plain, as required by the legislation.\nBefore Canada tried stopping the ANWR effort, Sullivan had already been working on a measure to reform the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that taxes oil production to fund spill cleanup efforts, said Matt Shuckerow, a spokesman with Sullivan's office, on Friday.\nAs part of that work, Sullivan and other lawmakers had considered including language that would close a loophole on oil imported to the U.S. from Alberta's tar sands deposits, Shuckerow said.\n\"This effort began long before the expressed opposition by the Canadian government on opening ANWR to responsible resource development,\" Shuckerow said.\nBut Canada's actions \u2014 described as \"outrageous\" by Sullivan \u2014 ultimately helped the senator decide to include language to close the loophole, according to Bloomberg.\nThe loophole allows hundreds of millions of barrels of oil a year from the Canadian deposit to avoid the liability fund tax, amounting to a $47 million savings in 2016.\nSullivan said Canadian officials were visiting every office in the Senate last year to kill Alaska's refuge-opening effort.\n\"It was not a smart move,\" he said, according to Bloomberg. \"It's a loophole and we intend to close it.\"\nBloomberg said Sullivan planned to punish Canada.

By moving bus stops to Gildredge Road for westbound buses and Cornfield Road for eastbound, the scheme is able to drastically reduce the number of buses using Terminus Road making it a lot less congested and improving air quality. Reducing this stretch to one lane also means we can double the width of the pavements on both sides of the road making it a more attractive spacious and pleasant environment for pedestrians. Buses will only enter the one lane from the railway station travelling towards Bankers Corner. The scheme will create a new space at Bankers Corner for cultural and social activities. High-quality paving is being introduced to the footpath and the road will be surfaced using granite blocks.\nWhat\u2019s happening in Gildredge Road where work is taking 62 weeks?\nOne lane of Gildredge Road will be designated a bus lane for buses coming into the town centre. We are currently undertaking kerbing and footway works along the southern end of Gildridge Road including pedestrian islands to aid movement of bus passengers across Gildredge Road. Top of the range bus shelters and real time passenger information boards will provide enhanced facilities for bus passengers and other street furniture will radically alter the appearance of this area of the town centre. All traffic is currently turning left into Station Parade with no direct access to Ashford Road until the raised, signalled junction is completed in spring next year.\nWhat has been going on in Terminus Road West from Grove Road to Ashford Road?\nContractors have completed ground work, drainage and kerbing and started laying granite blocks in the road. They also started work on the pavement on the southern side of the road opposite the railway station. By the end of December vehicles will drive on the new road surface and work will begin on the opposite lane outside the station shops.\nAnd Terminus Road East which is Ashford Road to Cornfield Road?\nWe are progressing on the pavements and bus lane, working on the northern side of the road and beginning laying granite road surface and paving slabs. Once a significant proportion of the new bus lane is completed, which we expect to do by the end of November, we will start running bus services along this road. New planters and lighting are also being put in.\nWhy is part of Cornfield Road going to be closed for eight months?\nDue to the poor conditions of the road we are carrying out a full depth excavation of the carriageway here hence the need to close one lane of the road with a diversion route in place. A new bus lane is being put in for eastbound services and it will also be 20mph. There are major changes to on-street parking arrangements in Cornfield Road. Once again there will be high quality seating, tree pits, decorative lighting and top of the range bus shelters plus new trees.\nWho is behind the roadworks?\nEast Sussex and Eastbourne councils have invested \u00a38.2 million in the scheme.\nFor more on the scheme and to see a video visit www.eastbourneherald.co.uk for an interview with Highways boss Nick Bennett or drop into the contractor, Mildren hub next to Specsavers in Terminus Road.\nConstruction officials and"}

It would take decades for him to show \u2014 or even feel \u2014 remorse.\nThe judge in a San Bernardino courtroom sentenced Romero to life in prison. The year was 1991. Romero was 19.\nOn an early Sunday morning in January 2019, a dozen people gathered in the lobby of Beit T\u2019Shuvah, a rehab facility in west Los Angeles.

He\u2019s an athletic guy who played handball and soccer in prison, but he\u2019s a novice runner. He broke into a jog.\nLater, he was still jogging steadily as team members shouted encouragement. After 14 miles, he crossed an imaginary finish line and slowed to a walk. Gold and another runner slapped him high fives.\nRunning a marathon is something Romero never thought he would do. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s a step forward. A step away from his past.\nLooking back now, Romero knows the moment his life took a dark path, when he went from a shy kid, playing alone with Star Wars action figures, to someone filled with rage.

Soon he was doing speed, then dealing speed. Soon he was breaking into cars, getting into fights, robbing houses.\nStill, he managed to avoid trouble with the law.

Waiting two hours for a land ambulance while in cardiac arrest is a story that is unlikely to have a happy ending.\nIt\u2019s this type of situation that is highlighted in a February 2017 report from the B.C. Forest Safety Ombudsman, Roger Harris.\nThe document, titled Will It Be There \u2013 A Report on Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in BC, delivers a critical analysis of the province\u2019s emergency helicopter response capability and takes the position that the location of an injured worker \u2014 or indeed, any citizen \u2014 should not impact the timeliness and quality of emergency medical attention they receive.\nIn fact, the report found that HEMS service in B.C. is inferior when compared to other jurisdictions with similar geography, such as Washington State or Alaska, where 99 percent of the population is within a 60-minute response time to a Level 3 trauma center.\nThe Ombudsman\u2019s findings are no surprise to Miles Randell and Paul Windsor.\nBoth are long-time experienced paramedics with BCAS. In January 2017, just a month before the report was released, the two men decided to collaborate on the creation of a not-for-profit entity that would deliver advanced medical care to patients located in British Columbia\u2019s most isolated regions.\n\u201cWe realized we needed to go out on our own, create our own society, and prove the need was there,\u201d Randell told Vertical during an interview at the 2017 Abbotsford International Airshow.\nRandell and Windsor approached Blackcomb Helicopters in the town of Squamish, where they planned to base their new response unit.\nImmediately, Blackcomb management saw the vision behind the paramedics\u2019 proposal and agreed to support the founding of Technical Evacuation Advanced Aero Medical, or TEAAM.\n\u201cThey were so interested in the program that they jumped in with both feet and have done everything they can to support us,\u201d said Randell, who is president of the new organization.\nRandell acknowledged that TEAAM\u2019s founding comes at an opportune time, when the province\u2019s Forest Safety Ombudsman has focused public attention on the provision of HEMS in British Columbia.\nThe new service will be getting off the ground thanks to a number of significant industry partnerships.\nHe said it will cost about $2.5 million annually to provide one dedicated on-call aircraft, a Blackcomb Helicopters EC-135 T2+.

Snap has warned it may never become profitable.\nAnalysts unrelated to the IPO had in recent weeks mostly assigned neutral or negative ratings to Snap, making it one of the worst-rated stocks on Wall Street.\nBut on Monday, at least eight banks involved in Snap\u2019s IPO gave it positive ratings, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Its stock rose 4.79 percent to end at $23.83.\nThat left Snap up 37 percent from its $17 initial public offer price, but still down more than $3 from its peak in its second day of trading.\nThe Los Angeles-based company\u2019s app, which allows users to share short-lived messages and pictures, is popular with young people.

The animals' instinct for rooting behavior makes them naturals at sniffing out the valuable aromatic subterranean mushrooms.\nBut now the pigs' jobs are going to the dogs, especially in Oregon\u2019s truffle grounds, where the truffle hound-training industry is taking off.\nThere are many reasons why dogs are replacing pigs. They have more endurance, they're easier to train, and they\u2019re less likely to eat the truffle once they find it.\nTruffle hunters say it\u2019s much easier to get a truffle from away from a dog than from a hungry hog.\n\"The lore is that truffle hunters that use pigs don\u2019t tend to have all their fingers,\" Charles Lefevre, president and founder of New World Truffieres and organizer of the annual Oregon Truffle Festival, told Modern Farmer.\nHowever, the real advantage of using a dog is that you\u2019re less likely to look like you\u2019re hunting for truffles.\nTruffles are a valuable crop \u2014 two pounds of rare white Alba truffles can sell for almost $4,000 \u2014 so hunting them is often done discreetly. Plus, truffle-harvesting grounds are carefully guarded secrets, and hunters are protective of their turf.\n\"If you have a pig on a leash, everyone knows what you're doing,\" Lefevre said. \"But if you spot someone with a pooch on a leash, they could just be enjoying some fresh country air.\"\nOregon dog trainer Glenn Martyn, who's trained bomb- and drug-sniffing dogs since then 1960s, recently branched out into the truffle dog work. He says the principles are pretty much the same.\n\"The truffle, per se, is not something a dog would naturally search for on its own,\" he said. \"The truffle has to have some association with something. For most dogs, that positive association is food, and once a dog learns the truffle smell means food, they\u2019ll do whatever it takes to find that truffle smell.\"\nMartyn starts training a truffle dog by coating an item in truffle oil and having the dog find it. He buries the item under leaves, then rocks and finally in the soil. Every time the canine successfully finds it, he's rewarded with a treat or favorite toy.\nOnce the dog masters these exercises, an actual truffle replaces the object, and soon the dog is ready to sniff out the underground delicacies."}

Anti-erbB2/neu monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) alone are only effective in 30 percent of breast cancer patients carrying the amplified target and cost about $100,000 a year. Currently, this antibody treatment must be combined with chemotherapy to increase the proportion of patients it helps.\nThe major take-away from this study is that treatment with herceptin or lapatanib followed by interferon-gamma dramatically improves tumor eradication in the mice, said senior author Mark Greene, MD, PhD, the John W. Eckman Professor of Medical Science. This one-two punch, which is a continuation of the pioneered antibody based Her-2 targeted therapy from this lab, renders the tumors highly sensitive to chemotherapy, which is needed to make the targeted therapy work.\nThis therapy, when translated for use in people humans, would be beneficial in reducing toxicity because the amount of antibody could be decreased by two-thirds and the amount of chemotherapy by at least half. This in turn, \u201creduces the cost of treatment so that individuals previously not able to afford targeted therapy will be able to do so. All of the therapeutic agents used in this preclinical study are approved and we expect to try ordered therapy plus interferon in clinical trials soon,\u201d Greene said.\n\u201cWe examined the biologic effects of interferon-gamma alone or after anti-erbB2/neu antibody treatment of erbB2-positive cells and mice,\u201d said co-first author Yasuhiro Nagai, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.\nInterferon-gamma is a small protein called a cytokine normally produced by T cells as part of the immune response. Interferon-gamma is a well-known cytokine to immunologists but is not used by oncologists so much because of other side effects. Interferon-gamma works by rendering the tumor cells much more susceptible to Her-2 inhibitors so that tumor cells can be killed more effectively. In addition, this combination therapy also augments host tumor immunity, which can be a good advantage for this therapy.\nIn a series of experiments in breast cancer cell lines and transgenic mice that develop breast cancer as adults, the team found that interferon-gamma on its own had no effect on tumors. Treatment of the tumors with anti-erbB2/neu mAbs followed by interferon-gamma led to a considerable inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of tumor size in the mice when the therapy is combined with a typical chemotherapeutic agent.\nOthers on the paper include co-first authors Hiromichi Tsuchiya and E. Aaron Runkle, both postdoctoral fellows at the time of the study in the Greene lab. The research will be followed by clinical trials in patients in both United States and Japan.\nThis work was supported by grants from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and the National Cancer Institute (R01CA089481, R01CA149425, T32 CA009140)."}

State officials say that would result in an effective tax rate of 20 percent, which would put Maine right alongside Oregon in having the lowest recreational marijuana tax rates in the nation.\nThe legislative committee whose bill will launch Maine\u2019s recreational marijuana market \u2013 which state officials predict will hit $85 million in retail sales in its first full year of operation \u2013 approved the regulatory and licensing bill by a 16-1 vote. It calls for a three-year residency requirement for license applicants, a limit of three home-grow plants per adult, and an unlimited number of commercial licenses. Towns that host marijuana businesses would not get any of the state taxes.\nThis bill would replace the Marijuana Legalization Act approved by voters in a 2016 referendum. That law, which is in effect now even though the state is not issuing any commercial licenses, set a 20 percent retail sales tax but did not levy an excise tax, gave medical marijuana caregivers a licensing preference but not residents, allowed adults to grow up to six plants on their property or someone else\u2019s with permission, and allowed social clubs, drive-up windows and home delivery.\nThe compromise won over Rep. Patrick Corey, R-Windham, who voted against last year\u2019s version of the bill but praised the \u201camazing give and take\u201d of this version. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the bill will win over the support of the House Republican caucus, which helped Gov. Paul LePage kill the committee\u2019s first bill. House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, predicted that LePage will probably veto this committee bill, too.\nThe proposed tax rate, which was unveiled Friday, includes a 21.5 percent excise tax levied on wholesale marijuana when a cultivator sells the unprocessed material to a processor or retailer, and a 10 percent retail tax. Because the value of unprocessed marijuana is so much lower than the retail product, state officials say the 21.5 percent excise tax is equivalent to the amount of money that would be raised from another 10 percent retail tax levied at the point of sale.\nThe state Department of Administration and Financial Services projects the state would collect $2.7 million in overall marijuana taxes in fiscal year 2020, the first year it expects to see any sales, and $16.3 million in fiscal year 2021, the first full year of market sales. That is based on a $335 excise tax levied on every pound of marijuana flower and mature plants sold by a cultivator. It predicts that Maine adults would spend $85 million on recreational marijuana in the first full year of the market.\nState officials are projecting that sales will not begin until 2020, three years after voters had wanted, saying it will take nine months to write regulations, time for the next Legislature to approve those regulations, time to accept and award state licenses and then more time for those companies that win licenses to grow the cannabis for sale.

When I started writing this list years and years ago, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on most of the original shows being produced for television, including network TV and a smattering of cable and subscription cable shows. Then, cable started producing more originals. Next, streaming services began to produce their own line-ups of shows. Then each of these outlets ramped up to produced even more original content. At this point, there are hundreds of shows being produced each year, for a variety of different audiences. In fact, a recent report revealed there are estimated to be 455 shows that were produced for U.S. television in 2016.\nGo ahead and digest that number for a minute. Back in 2002, the study reports there were only 182 programs being produced each year, and the majority of those were found on network television. In a mere 14 years, those numbers have more than doubled and have proven that they may eventually even triple. It's no wonder that fewer and fewer people are watching network shows and mediums like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are getting more popular. Intriguingly, it shows that all mediums have increased in programming, as well.\nThe most recent information, which comes to us courtesy of FX Networks Research shows that in 2016 broadcast shows bumped up from 135 originals in 2002 to 145 originals in 2016. On cable, the numbers are even more striking. In 2002, basic cable produced 30 original shows. In 2016, that number was 181, with many of those shows coming from channels such as FX and AMC. Streaming is also a brand new market. In 2002, there were no online outlets producing original shows, but by 2016 93 originals were produced on services like Netflix and even Seeso. Thanks to channels like Starz and Cinemax increasing output, the numbers on subscription cable jumped from 17 in 2002 to 36 in 2016. Not too shabby overall.\nAs you will note, the broadcast networks have remained the steadiest in terms of number of programs produced, which other networks and services have begun really producing content in abundance. A few years ago, it was FX's John Landgraf who announced we were reaching peak TV, but since 2015's numbers indicate that 415 originals were produced and that number jumped to 455 shows in 2016, it doesn't seem as if we've actually hit that max number, yet. Still, 455 shows is nearly impossible to keep track of and we wouldn't be surprised if only a few of these make your regular viewing list.\nSo, how many shows can you keep up with each week?

The forum had also asked the court to declare all power purchase agreements Eskom had already concluded with IPPs null and void.\nMeyer said the forum had failed to show that it was entitled to the relief it sought, and ordered the organisation to pay the legal costs for Eskom, the National Energy Regulator, the energy minister and 27 responding power producers.\nThe case forms part of a wider effort from the coal industry to thwart the government\u2019s uptake of green power, ostensibly at the expense of the fossil fuels industry.\nThrough its Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme, the government has procured about 6,400MW of green power and attracted more than R200bn in investment.\nAccording to the South African Wind Energy Association, a leading renewable industry association, the case is the second major application in the past two years to be brought against renewable energy IPPs by coal interests, and dismissed with costs.\nIn an e-mailed response, the association said it welcomed the comprehensive judgment, as well as the court's recognition of SA's commitment to move away from coal power.\nAt about the same time that the judgment was handed down, energy minister Jeff Radebe assured IPPs that their place in SA\u2019s energy future would be secured by the revised Integrated Resource Plan, the gazetting of which was imminent.

Students who are sure their focus will be international trade should take one or both of the following courses to understand the operation of the WTO and the role of various U.S. policies in the negotiation of trade agreements: Law, Economics and Policy of Trade; the World Trade Organization (WTO) Law, Policy and Politics.\nThis seminar focuses on current legal, political and policy issues related to the World Trade Organization (\"WTO\"). An analysis of these issues focuses on how the WTO really works from a legal, political and diplomatic standpoint. The course begins with a brief examination of free trade, globalization, and the evolution of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\"GATT\") into the WTO. It then looks at how the U.S. Government formulates trade policy and negotiates trade issues and factors that affect negotiations. It then examines the Seattle trade ministerial meeting in 1999 and its failure, and the subsequent Doha Round of negotiations. The course goes on to consider how major substantive issues, such as agriculture, labor, the environment, intellectual property rights and competition are being addressed in the WTO, as well as the manner in which the WTO deals with developing and least developed countries and the effect of unilateralism and regional trade agreements on global trade. In addition to considering major substantive issues facing the WTO, the class also examines structural issues, including, through an examination of major cases, the efficacy of the dispute settlement mechanism. It looks at all of these cases from legal and policy standpoints as well as from \"inside\" politics."}

And even though her family's $700-a-month address sits across from a public school, they are among the only occupants of this desolate block.\nLife in an emptied-out, rundown cityscape is a slog and Rollins is worn out by all of it: The sounds of late-night interlopers stomping down the stairs of a musty wreck next door; a constant fear of fire set by vandals; the social isolation; the rats. With no faith in a prompt police response, they keep a bat at the ready.\n\"It's like we're a forgotten population,\" said Rollins, a Baltimore native who's studying for a community college degree that she hopes will get her family out of this gloomy neighborhood \u2014 maybe even out of the city that part of her still loves.\nThe African-American woman with a bright-eyed 6-year-old daughter and a husband on disability isn't the only one with leaving on her mind. At a time when rival cities are gaining population, Baltimore's decades-long disappearing act is only continuing.\nIn 1950, Baltimore was America's sixth most populous city, with nearly a million residents, many employed by Bethlehem Steel. Over decades, with factories closed and \"white flight\" in the 1960s and '70s followed by waves of \"black flight,\" it's shrunk to the country's 30th largest, a loss of nearly 350,000 people.\nAccording to U.S. Census estimates, Baltimore led all American cities in population loss for the last two years running. Census figures indicate the city saw more people leave its boundaries than Chicago, which also reported significant losses, even though Baltimore is only a quarter of its size.\nEven with job gains, stately historic districts, and gleaming waterfront areas, Baltimore overall has about the same population today as it did 100 years ago. Only 17 of Baltimore's 55 communities gained households between 2010 and 2016, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. Many are in the city's prosperous and mostly white areas.\nMaryland's biggest city is hardly alone in dealing with issues of urban decay. Nationwide, places like Detroit and Newark have struggled with similar problems. Out of 33 U.S. cities with a population larger than 500,000, only Baltimore and Detroit have seen overall declines since 2010.\nBut Baltimore's sea of vacant lots and roughly 16,000 uninhabitable row homes with weeds growing out of boarded-up windows have proven especially intractable in racially segregated, deeply poor areas. Housing researchers say some 20,000 other city properties are unoccupied and pose a risk of becoming crumbling shells. They largely sit in downtrodden swaths of West and East Baltimore.\nThose predominantly African-American neighborhoods with a concentration of derelict buildings offer ghostly scenes: A silenced piano coated in chipped paint, bowed floors with stacks of pulpy notebooks, an entire row house given way to a tree bursting through its roof. Scavengers can easily get inside boarded up properties to wrench pipes from walls. Criminals stash contraband there.\n\"There are whole sections of our city that"}

Players like Samuel Umtiti, Raphael Varane (who actually missed the tournament through injury) and Antoine Griezmann have all grown in stature since Euro2016 while the rate at which the likes of Corentin Tolisso, Ousmane Deb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Kylian Mapp\u00e9 have acquired so much has ensured that there was simply no alternative but to make space for them in the squad.\nThere are imponderables, most obviously Paul Pogba, the spectacular talent who blew so hot and cold two summers ago that he threatened, it seemed, to destabilise the entire campaign at one point because Dechamps had come under such intense pressure to get the very best out of him.\nAnd not everyone is convinced with Age Hareide, manager of Denmark, who the French will face in their third group game, sufficiently unconcerned about the danger of offering hostages to fortune, that he last week described the French team as \u201cnothing special\u201d.\nMartin O\u2019Neill seemed genuinely taken aback by the comment when it was put to him by members of the local media at the pre-match conference at the Stade de France on Sunday and respectfully disagreed with his old friend.\nHe pointed to an almost unbroken pedigree stretching back to the side led by Michel Platini, the major successes since and the quality of the current squad before rating their chances of marking the 20th anniversary of their triumph on home soil with another World Win in Moscow as \u201cas good as anybody\u2019s\u201d.\nStill, H"}

But their replacement plan could make those problems even worse.\nRepublicans are constrained by their small majority in the Senate. Instead of passing a normal piece of legislation that could change the Affordable Care Act\u2019s many insurance regulations, they are limited to changes that can be accomplished through a technical budgetary maneuver, a reconciliation bill.\nMany conservative legislators would prefer a reprise of a 2015 bill that would have simply swept away much of Obamacare. But the current bill\u2019s drafters have felt political pressure from President Trump and their constituents to preserve some of the health law\u2019s coverage gains. Their efforts to preserve popular parts of the law and work within the special budget rules have led to the uneasy mix of policies in the bill.\nThe bill keeps many of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules for insurance companies that Republicans have decried for raising costs. Here\u2019s what stays.\n\u25a0 The health law\u2019s rule that insurance companies must sell polices to the healthy and the sick at the same price.\n\u25a0 Its rule that insurance companies can\u2019t limit the benefits they pay out in a year or a lifetime.\n\u25a0 Its requirements that all plans cover 10 categories of benefits, including preventive health services without a co-payment, rehabilitation services and maternity care.\n\u25a0 The law\u2019s caps on how much customers can be asked to pay for health care through deductibles and co-payments.\nThose are popular provisions; they tend to make insurance coverage comprehensive but also somewhat costly. (The main reason that health insurance plans are expensive, of course, is because medical care is expensive, and the bill doesn\u2019t do anything about that either.) Because they all stay, the rest of the policy changes are built atop a chassis of health insurance products that cost what today\u2019s plans cost.\nThe bill effectively slashes subsidies that help many low-income people buy insurance, starting in 2020. A 60-year-old earning $20,000 in Lincoln, Neb., currently gets a subsidy of $18,470 to help her buy insurance, with extra subsidies to help her pay deductibles and co-payments, according to calculations made by Kaiser. Under the new legislation, she would get a subsidy of $4,000, and no help with cost sharing.\nThe bill also does away with Obamacare\u2019s requirement that people have insurance or pay a fine. That provision is unpopular, but it is seen as an important incentive for healthy people to buy insurance every year. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating that provision would lead to premiums that are 20 to 25 percent higher, even without any cuts in subsidies.\nAs a counterweight, the bill does some things that would tend to stabilize prices. It gives states a big pot of money to help keep markets working. It allows insurance companies to charge higher prices to old customers and less to younger ones. That is not so good for our hypothetical 60-year-old in Nebraska, but might help lure some healthy 20-year-olds into the market who don\u2019t buy insurance now.\nIt also creates a new kind of financial incentive to buy insurance: People with a lapse in insurance coverage of more than a couple of months would have to pay a 30 percent higher price for their insurance when they re-enter the market.

It could still leave without a deal on June 1 if MPs reject taking part in European elections.\nDespite the uncertainty, Mr Webb said: \"The economy across Ireland has shown remarkable resilience over the past few years. While there is a marked difference in the pace of growth between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we expect both parts of the island to continue growing during the year.\n\"Much of the forward outlook is still dependent on Brexit and the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union.\n\"The most recent delay, until the end of October potentially, provides some breathing space and perhaps room for calm heads to prevail, but it brings no certainty for business.\"\nThe senior economist said that while Brexit had dominated the socio-economic and political conversation north and south of the border for more than three years, a number of issues were equally concerning.\n\"In addition to planning for Brexit, both economies on the island face challenges around issues such as skills, innovation, productivity, housing, internationalisation, economic inactivity and entrepreneurship,\" said Mr Webb.\n\"At an all-island level - almost ironically given where Brexit could take us - there has been an increased focus to develop a more integrated economy, either through the Belfast to Dublin eastern corridor initiative, the Wild Atlantic Way or the North West Regional Development Group.

In San Bernardino and other cities, cops and firefighters have organized themselves into politically-potent unions that provide coveted endorsements.\nBut 2009 is shaping up to be more than just another election year for San Bernardino. It is a time when falling real estate values and a shrinking retail tax base are making it practically impossible for city officials to maintain essential services.\nCity data shows that officials expect to take in about $25.6 million in sales tax revenue during the current fiscal year. That\u2019s about $5 million less than what was anticipated in the city\u2019s budget.\nSan Bernardino administrators are working under the assumption that a $9 million general fund shortfall will develop by the time the fiscal year ends June 30 and are preparing deep budget cuts for most city departments.\nThe proposed cuts could eliminate 130 jobs from San Bernardino\u2019s budget, and interim City Manager Mark Weinberg says the situation is so grim that sworn police officers and firefighters cannot be excluded from potential layoffs.\n\u201cFront-line public safety response service must still remain our top priority. But given that Police and Fire operations now comprise 70 percent of the General Fund budget, it is inevitable that these departments must contribute toward reducing the deficit,\u201d Weinberg wrote in a memo to the City Council.\nWeinberg has submitted a twin proposal for layoffs, and the council voted 5-1 Monday to prepare for the firings.\nUnder Weinberg\u2019s preferred proposal, police would lose more than $5.4 million in funding. That\u2019s the largest cut for any city department and would result in the letting go of 29 officers, a figure that includes four sergeants and five detectives.\nIt would also bump seven sergeants and 15 detectives down a rank, dropping their pay along with them.\nOn the civilian side, the department could lose five community service officers, a records technician and a senior office assistant.\nThe Police Department is also slated to lose funding for helicopter patrols, the Police Activities League, monies that go to the Young Visionaries Youth Leadership Academy and overtime for corridor patrols.\nBilldt, who insisted the department would maintain its current 28-beat policing model, would not directly comment on how a reduction in officers may impact crime.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus to make sure we keep the same amount of personnel on the streets and work toward making sure we don\u2019t degrade our response times in terms of service,\u201d he said.\nBut police officers argue that laying off a significant number of cops puts the city\u2019s improving crime rate in peril, and could potentially sway sworn personnel from ever coming to work in San Bernardino.\nThe mayor and police chief have touted dropping crime rates over the last year, a feat seemingly made possible by an increase in officers patrolling the"}

Heitkamp, a Democrat, comes up for re-election in five weeks in North Dakota, a deeply red state in which the Kavanaugh nomination was supported by a 2-1 margin. She announced her opposition a day after a poll showed her trailing her Republican challenger by 10 points, and on the very day that another poll showed her 12 points behind.\nHeitkamp might have taken the easy way out by reciting the inane, dishonest formulation concocted by Republican strategists that Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s sworn testimony was \u201ccredible\u201d (Trump) and \u201ccompelling\u201d (Susan Collins), but that somehow this did not translate into probable cause to believe that Kavanaugh had committed perjury and sexual assault. The gibberish decided on by the GOP was that Ford deserved to be believed in all respects other than her identification of Kavanaugh \u2014 even though she accurately remembered the names of Kavanaugh\u2019s close friends, and even given all the other circumstantial evidence that she was telling the truth and Kavanaugh was not. In other words, went the Trump/Collins line, Ford was only fabricating the part about Kavanaugh. Which would mean that she wasn\u2019t \u201ccredible\u201d or \u201ccompelling\u201d at all. This, quite literally, was nonsense.\nUnlike others, including Collins, Heitkamp apparently had little appetite for drivel. \u201c(T)he hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s current temperament, honesty and impartiality,\u201d she declared. \u201cThese are critical traits for any nominee to serve on the highest court in the land.\u201d She will probably pay a severe price for courage that set her apart from 50 of her colleagues, including one or two of whom more might have been expected.

In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality. But, rather than teams of robots, it involves a more promising environment with people, automation, and artificial intelligence working side by side.\nThis hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders \u2013 the companies generating impact from AI \u2013 expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020. Moreover, in a related Genpact survey of workers, 40% said they would be comfortable with robots in the same timeframe. Such human-and-machine collaboration is what defines the next generation of work, which sees intelligent systems taking over processes, augmenting human tasks, and creating new jobs.\nAs AI and automation can radically change operations, businesses need to put considerable thought into change management and planning. This is a critical step. When overlooked, it leads to business disruptions later in operations, from new digital tools and staff. In a rush to get systems deployed, some forget that processes do not exist in a vacuum, but instead involve triggers and exchanges.\nFor instance, a minor change to a CRM application can throw off robots working with income statements further down the line. Companies need to map out how various bots and systems will work together to prevent roadblocks. On the human end, leaders need to communicate the coming changes well in advance so people understand the impact and prevent any dissidence.\nWith a human workforce, companies can easily see when employees clock in, clock out, or do not show up for work. With robots, it becomes more difficult to track if there is a glitch or sudden change that stops them from working. For instance, if a password change prevents bots from logging into an application, not only does the work come to a halt, but it may also go unnoticed for a period of time. Companies need to be able to see who/what is working, what they are working on, and whether or not they are effective.\nA potential solution is to develop a \u201cvisualization dashboard\u201d to oversee automated operations. A dashboard can provide a single view of all robots, intelligent automation, and workflow orchestration. Managers can then easily monitor performance, tasks in queue, and process completions to ensure maximum performance and productivity.\nThere is a misconception that AI is more mature than it is. Understanding how far businesses can go with deploying AI, and being aware of its limitations, can help with managing digital workforce planning and knowing where people with domain knowledge need to step in. For instance, any automation requires an understanding of the different exchanges within a process, which only comes from prior experience.\nThe intersection of domain knowledge, AI, and creativity is what will drive success. Companies need people who can apply and translate their experience in meaningful ways to digital applications. On the other end, AI and automation can elevate and free people, like IT staff, from repetitive, common tasks, allowing them to take on more strategic jobs focused on growth.\nOrganizations will need to reskill employees with digital know-how in addition to their requisite knowledge. This not only results in greater talent, but also better employee goodwill and engagement. At the same time, they should have focused recruiting programs looking for \u201cbilingual\u201d people who have both domain and digital knowledge, and can bridge the connections.\nTo avoid unintended outcomes, it is up to humans to identify potential biases and monitor the machines"}

{"idx": "23164", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: On some level, I don't really need to write a review of the Jaguar F-Type R Coupe. I mean, just look at it.\nEverywhere I drove, this car turned heads. People in both trendy Manhattan neighborhoods and back country villages in Connecticut loved this car.\nMany thought it was something Italian, like a Ferrari or a Maserati, and more than one person said something to the effect of \"I've never seen a Jaguar like that before.\"\nThat's the thing about the F-Type Coupe; the form is so spectacular, the function doesn't really matter. This is a car Jaguar could \u2014 and probably does \u2014 sell on looks alone.\nBut this car's story doesn't end there. My particular tester was an R model. As such, it comes with a 550-horsepower supercharged 5.0-liter V8 engine, all-wheel drive (AWD) and an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The total cost: A little over $119,000.\nThe F-Type name is a reference to Jaguar's iconic 1962 E-Type sports car, considered by some the most beautiful car ever built. And its moniker is more than a nod to the past; the F-Type is the British brand's first true sports car since the E-Type.\nLike the E-Type before it, I'd agruge the F-Type is just about the best-looking car on sale today. It manages to be muscular, but not in the way an anabolically enhanced athlete is muscular. Somehow the F-Type is both punchy and subtle, masculine and feminine.\nIts design doesn\u2019t shout to the world about how great it is at first glance, but invites repeated viewings. Each look reveals a new detail that you might have missed before. If you catch it at the right angle, you might notice how stubby the rear deck is or the subtle upward curve of the exhaust pipes.\nThe car is rich with little things that catch your eye the longer you spend time with it.\nIts proportions are spot-on as well. It takes the classic sports car formula of long-hood, short-deck and modernizes it. The wheels are pushed way out towards the four corners and the character line rises dramatically at the rear.\nYou could spend hours looking at the F-Type and never get tired of it.\nThose good looks come at a cost, and that\u2019s interior space and visibility, or rather, the lack thereof.\nThe sloping rear deck looks amazing, but it creates massive blind spots and leaves you with a tiny rear window that makes driving the F-Type in city traffic very tricky. To partially solve this, drivers can rely on the mirror-mounted blind spot monitoring system, which works well on the highway. It falls flat, however, when sharing the road with crazed Manhattan cyclists and tourists, as they're too small and quick for the system to pick up.\nSitting very low in the car, looking out over a tall cowl (the place where the hood and windshield meet), forward visibility is better than in the rear... but only negligibly so. This is a big problem in the city, but not a huge deal out on the country roads where the F-Type is in its element.\nUnless you're a sociopath, driving this car on public roads is an exercise in restraint. That's because the unmatched roar of the exhaust and addictive immediacy of the supercharged V8's acceleration is too tempting not to indulge every few"}

{"idx": "23170", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Mads Gilbert may be a good surgeon, but his values are not those of a humanitarian.\nThe iconic picture from the current conflict in Gaza has been that of a courageous Norwegian doctor saving Palestinian lives. Here he is, the only westerner in Gaza, who is able to not only save lives but also run his own news agency out of a hospital, informing Western media about what is \"really\" happening and - here is the catch - who is to be blamed, namely Israel. Like millions of other people I have seen these images on the evening news, and I have read about his eyewitness reports day after day. After all, there were no other \"reliable sources\" available in Gaza, it was said. At first I watched this new Bernard Kouchner personality with great admiration. But then it occurred to me. Something was not right. Why did the doctor seem more interested in explaining who was right and who was wrong than in saving lives? Most humanitarian relief workers are there to save lives. Most leave it at this. Explaining who is right and who is wrong is not their call, but to save lives and ease the suffering. So I googled 'Mads Gilbert.' The profile I discovered on Wikipedia was not one of a humanitarian icon but that of a political activist with a clear Marxist agenda. His convictions were those of the extreme left; he had accused both the US and Israel of war crimes long before the current military operation in Gaza. IN FACT, the doctor who was trying to alert the world about the human suffering in Gaza had in 2001 the following to say about the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Question: So do you support this terrorist attack on the US? Answer: \"Terror is a bad weapon but my answer is yes\" (Wikipedia). This had to be a scam. I did what every concerned citizen would have done. I called the responsible editor of the evening news and of the main daily where I live. Did they know? No they did not. Were they going to do anything to correct the news reports? Answer: What is there to correct? We live in a cynical world which is shaped by iconic images. People remember pictures. The first man on the moon, JFK being shot in Dallas and now the courageous Norwegian doctor in Gaza explaining to the world the atrocities of Israel. These are the images that will remain in the collective memory of people for years to come and will shape their perception of the conflict in Gaza. Even a small correction will not do much to change the public opinion which has already been shaped, influenced by the images in the news reports. The false icon will remain. MADS GILBERT may be a good surgeon, but his values are not those of a humanitarian. When he appears in the news as the \"accidental hero,\" we need to learn about his other credentials as well. How trustworthy are his claims? Was he involved in other missions to help the Palestinian people than simply medical work and public relations? We do not know. What we do know by now is that Mads Gilbert and his friend Erik Fosse did not end up in Gaza by accident. They did not come only to help out in a hospital but with a clear political agenda to sell. And they did it very successfully because in Marxist theory the means justify the end. The truth is secondary. But this text is not about Mads Gilbert. It is about how helpless most of us are when we are exposed to world events where it is impossible for us to know who is telling the truth and who is not.

{"idx": "23173", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: OSHKOSH, Wisconsin - Aviation industry heavyweight Cessna is bringing turbo-diesel power to its small aircraft lineup. The airplane maker will begin equipping its popular four-seat 182 Skylane model with a new engine that offers improved efficiency and the ability to burn a fuel widely available around the world. The new airplane, called the Cessna 182 NXT, made its first appearance at Airventure here in Oshkosh and will match the performance of the existing gasoline-powered version, while burning around 30 percent less fuel.\nThe new turbo-charged piston engine comes from the French company Safran and though it is a diesel power plant, Cessna is promoting the new engine because of its ability to burn the same fuel used by turbine and jet aircraft, known in aviation as \"Jet A.\" The fuel is similar to diesel, but unlike the fuel that goes into cars and trucks, Jet A is standardized around the world making certification of the engine and aircraft easier. The new Cessna 182 NXT is already certified by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency.\n\"We know internationally it's going to be huge with that fuel availability,\" said Cessna's Jeff Umscheid. \"This shows the direction that Cessna is going, focusing on Jet A.\"\nDiesel-based engines are not entirely new to aircraft. For several years various manufacturers have shown diesel/Jet A power plants here at Oshkosh. Diamond Aircraft offers two of its models with diesel powerplants, but with an industry giant like Cessna committing to jet-fuel burning, piston engines for its smaller aircraft does represent a turning point.\nThe 305-cubic-inch (5 liter) turbo-diesel engine produces 230 horsepower at 2,200 rpm.\nThe new 182 NXT will have the same 155 knot (178 mph) cruise speed as the current gasoline-powered aircraft. But the current turbocharged airplane burns around 16 gallons per hour to achieve that speed, the new jet fuel burning 182 burns only 11 gallons per hour.\nThe switch to Jet A also gives Cessna a convenient solution around the dwindling availability of aviation gasoline. Piston-powered airplanes are among the last vehicles in the world still using leaded gasoline. The fuel is a low-lead fuel still widely available in the United States and Canada, but increasingly rare (and expensive) in Europe and South America. Throughout much of Asia and Africa the fuel is not available and aircraft operating in these regions - often flying doctors and supplies for relief organizations - must ship in their own fuel by the barrel at costs often exceeding $20 per gallon. Because of the widespread use of jet and turbine aircraft including helicopters, Jet A is widely available around the world.\nSafran's Nicolas Menage says in Europe aviation gasoline can cost up to 60 percent more than jet fuel. But beyond the cost and efficiency benefit, the fuel pollutes less with no lead or carbon monoxide emissions. And Menage says performance is better, \"at 10,000 feet the engine still produces maximum take off power [230 hp].\"\nMenage says the turbo-diesel engine can burn diesel fuel and even biodiesel, but it is not certified by the various aviation agencies for using these fuels because of the"}

The Premiere Accredited Center of PATH Intl. (Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International) is one of only two in Northern Nevada, an area where children and adults with special needs are under-served. They work with individuals of all ages, facing a broad range of challenges such as Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Traumatic Brain injury, Sensory Processing Disorder, Stroke and learning disabilities. Kids and Horses has been serving the community with adaptive horseback riding lessons since 1999, teaching individuals with disabilities how to ride horses through safe, effective lessons by PATH-certified instructors.\nK&H Therapy now offers physical therapy and occupational therapy. Each licensed therapist is specially trained in using hippotherapy as a treatment strategy, making it unique to any therapy clinic in Northern Nevada. \"Hippos\" is Greek for horse and Hippotherapy translates to \"therapy with the help of a horse.\" Therapists direct the movement of the horse, the equipment used and the position of the patient achieve specific results. The goal is to help each person reach individualized functional goals such as climbing stairs, legibly writing a sentence or zipping a jacket. K&H Therapy will be taking medical insurances such as Medicaid, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Hometown Health as they become vetted through each insurance company.\nJoining the K&H Therapy team is a Physical Therapist Erin Vaillancourt (PT,DPT, HPCS) and Occupational Therapist Amy Schelert (OTR/L). Vaillancourt, who is a Doctor of Physical Therapy, holds one of only 108 Hippotherapy Clinical Specialist certifications in the World, and is the only person holding such certification in Nevada at this time. During her doctorate program Vaillancourt trained at the National Center for Equine Facilitated Therapy (NCEFT) in California, and has a passion for helping people gain functional achievements through the use of hippotherapy. \"During one therapy session, the patient experiences approximately 1000 repetitions of typical gait movement from the horse,\" said Vaillancourt. \"No other therapy tool or exercise can simulate the human walk as accurately.\" Vaillencourt said they can treat ages two to 100.\nAfter working as a PATH-certified instructor teaching adaptive riding, Amy earned her Master's degree in occupational therapy from the University of Southern California. Occupational therapy helps develop more independence in activities of daily living such as fastening a button, having the coordination to perform a jumping jack in P.E. or focusing during class. She performed a 13 week internship at the National Center for Equine Facilitated Therapy and completed her level I hippotherapy coursework from the American Hippotherapy Association.

{"idx": "23179", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Journalists love Twitter. We love it because it's an easy way to get our stories out. It's a shortcut to find quick, easy quotations for stories. And it is often an easy story in itself, hence the weird genre of stories about stories that were stories only on Twitter.\nFor example, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times (among many other publications) ran articles last week about a typo, \"covfefe,\" that appeared in one of President Trump's late night tweets. Between them, the two publications cited reactions from an NPR reporter, The New Yorker's television critic, political writer David Frum and late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel. That's a lot of talent expending brainwaves on \"covfefe.\"\nSo it has come to this: writers hyping Twitter typos by our tweeting head honcho. These stories\u2014about Twitter chatter about a Twitter typo\u2014took up the scarce time and resources of gifted writers and editors who are part of the free press necessary to our democracy. Sad! And those stories came a day after I'd read that half of President Trump's Twitter followers are likely fakes.\nAltogether, this news was, for me, like the worm in the fast-food burger, the gross thing you see that reminds you of all the gross things you cannot see.\nAs for me, no more checking Twitter 20 times a day, no more rushing to see who has retweeted my retweets.\nI'll be 43 soon, the age at which luminaries Jan Vermeer, John Candy and Andrew Breitbart bid farewell to this Earth. Mindful of the rabbinic sage Hillel the Elder's admonition, \"If not now, when?\" I have decided to make some changes. From here on out, there will be more: naps, trips to the beach, walks in the park with my dog, flossing, and ice-cold glasses of Coca-Cola. And fewer: impulse eBay purchases of tweed jackets, hours spent in traffic jams, and Diet Cokes.\nAnd less Twitter. Twitter does more harm than good. It's bad for me, and it's probably bad for you too, whoever you are.\nAt this point, some will object that Twitter is now part of American life, unlikely ever to go away. Which is the kind of thing that people once said about Friendster. But Twitter is not ubiquitous. For most Americans, it's not even a thing.\nIt's popular, for sure: In the first quarter of 2017, Twitter logged about 328 million monthly users worldwide. But only one quarter of American adults online use Twitter. Its growth is slowing, and it has nowhere near the reach of Facebook, which nearly 70% of all American adults use. What's more, for Facebook, that percentage holds up, more or less, across age groups, while fewer than 5% of Americans over age 55 use Twitter. That's one of the reasons it deserves to go away. Citizens with the most life experience, who are also those most likely to vote, are nearly absent from Twitter conversations (our president being a septuagenarian exception).\nAnd while we all, tweens and grandparents alike, tend to use Facebook in the same way\u2014to stay in touch with friends and family\u2014the asymmetry among different categories of Twitter users perpetuates the most puerile kind of celebrity worship. Most people have almost no followers, and just do the following. And they mainly follow a small group of superstars, like"}

{"idx": "23194", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Mitt Romney came with a written presentation. Barack Obama came with a seminar outline.\nLast night's presidential debate was a study in contrasts, but even more, it was the fulfillment of two wildly held assumptions about the candidates. There's Romney, the business man's business man, so polished that his surface has a way of reflecting whatever scene happens to swirl around him. And there's Obama, the detached philosopher, whose allure has always been his ability to appear coolly separate, even above, the scene around him. So there they were last night, filling out their stereotypes -- one polished, practiced in sound-bites, armed with short lists, making a pitch; the other comprehensive but rarely succinct and, somehow, separate.\nMitt Romney won by ... well, by being Mitt Romney, and Obama lost by being a caricature of his cool distracted professor alter-ego.\nA presidential campaign is a year-long decathlon, where candidates have to compete in contests as diverse as fundraising to managing state networks to avoiding gaffes. The evidence from the last 50 years shows that the decathlon -- plus \"fundamentals\" like foreign affairs and the economy -- matters more than any one televised competition. But even if you discount the power of debates, you shouldn't not count them. These are still 50-million-person theatrical events staged in the final chapter of a razor-thin election. And Romney was clearly the better performer last night. His style shined, both because he came prepared to make digestible points tailored for a moderate TV audience and because Obama did so little to force him off his game plan.\nI watched last night's presidential debate out of the corner of my eye. For better or worse, most of my attention was drawn to Twitter, where journalists and wonks agreed, through the use of various sports metaphors, that a focused Romney was giving a lethargic Obama a proper shellacking. Their insta-reaction anticipated the insta-reaction of viewers. A CBS flash poll had Romney winning the debate by a two-to-one margin, 46 percent-22 percent, with the rest calling it a tie. The CNN poll was even more decisive: 67 percent gave it to Romney, which is reportedly the widest victory in CNN post-debate history.\nLast night was a victory for Romney's style, but it was also a small vindication of his strategic pursuit of vagueness. His debate plan was ostensibly to be as specific about Obama's plan as he was unspecific about his own. And it worked.\nFor months, the press has encouraged Romney to be more specific. His tax plan, for example, isn't a document, but rather a list of principles. The only thing we know about his immense budget cuts is what he's promised not to cut (and it is a list so long it makes you wonder whether unemployment insurance will eventually have to run on donations). But Romney steadfastly resisted the specific, and for at least one night, it paid off. Asked if he would cut taxes for the rich, Romney said no. Pressed if he would raise taxes on the middle class, he said no. Roll back regulation? Not if it's smart regulation. Cut education? Of course not. Slash critical investments in America's future? Heck no.\nIf Obama had been better prepared for Romney's agility, he might have pointed out that all of these things can't be true at the same time. You cannot cut tax rates"}

Tim Roth's crime-fighting character in the Fox series Lie to Me was based on Ekman and his work at The Lightman Group.\nAnd yet, Ekman says anyone can do what he does, and to that end he has made the Micro Expression Training Tool available online. He says 100,000 people have used this tool to learn how to spot concealed emotions. It takes less than an hour.\nWhen Charles Darwin made his famous five-year voyage on the Beagle he met many people around the world whose languages he didn\u2019t share and yet he thought he could understand them through their facial expressions.\nDarwin could never prove this, but Ekman has.\nIn fact, Ekman has found that facial expressions express seven emotions - fear, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, enjoyment, and contempt. These seven emotions individually represent a \"family of emotions.\" In other words, there are many different variations to the type of anger someone might be feeling, and expressing. These emotions and their corresponding micro expressions are shared across cultures.\nSince these expressions show our true emotions, our faces often betray us.

Domenici, R-N.M., the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, kicked off last week with testimony from Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley and one of his better-known predecessors, William J. Bennett.\nMr. Bennett promoted school choice and a plan to give vouchers to needy students in Washington. The House last month passed a District of Columbia appropriations bill that includes a $7 million voucher plan. The Senate had not acted on it as of late last week.\n\"It's a very odd argument that unless we can help everybody, then we will help no one,\" said Mr. Bennett, who served as education secretary under President Reagan. \"There is no moral defense for keeping students in these lousy, rotten schools.\"\nMr. Riley took the opposite tack, saying vouchers for 2,000 Washington children do not amount to long-term reform. \"If you have $7 million to put into D.C. schools, put it into redoing the schools,\" he said.\nSen. Frist said last week that he wants to find ways to boost student achievement and that he worries American students are not keeping up academically with their peers in other countries.\nMr. Riley painted a rosier picture while promoting President Clinton's education agenda. He also criticized a bill that recently passed the House that would allow parents to set aside up to $2,500 a year in tax-exempt accounts that could be used to help pay education expenses for their children. The plan, sponsored by Sen. Paul Coverdell, D-Ga., would offer little or no savings for average families, Mr. Riley argued.\nMr. Coverdell, who is not a member of the task force but attended last week's meeting, shot back that the program would not take money away from public school students, but only give their families savings in taxes.\n\"If you have tax-free interest, then that's everybody in the country providing a benefit for that person,\" Mr. Riley replied.\nWhile Mr. Riley and Mr. Bennett took opposing sides on vouchers, they found common ground--up to a point--on an issue that has deeply divided members of Congress: national testing.\nMr. Bennett said he supports the concept of new national tests--an idea many other conservatives oppose. But he said he does not back Mr. Clinton's proposed plan for voluntary national tests of 4th and 8th graders, because he feels it could be subject to political influence.\nRead our story, \"Clinton Asks $10 Billion Boost for Education,\" Feb. 12, 1997."}

One of the first things I\u2019ll teach her is why there are sweets by the till in supermarkets. The reason is simple: a company\u2019s job is to make money, so it puts the sweeties there to try to tempt us to buy one more thing, so it can make a little more cash. It\u2019s our job to try not to be tempted, and make the right decisions for ourselves. This doesn\u2019t mean companies are wrong, just that they\u2019re there to sell to us, not look after us.\n2. If you spend money once, you can\u2019t spend it again. In other words, a lesson in opportunity cost. I\u2019m a great believer in letting kids earn pocket money, to teach a work ethic and the real value of cash. By giving them their own money they understand there is a choice: either buy something small this week or buy nothing, wait a few weeks for the cash to build, and have the big toy that you really want. Learning delayed gratification is crucial.\n3. Sometimes there are no right answers. This is for when she\u2019s quite a lot older. Learning about uncertainty is a crucial lesson in finance as in other elements of life. Is it wise to fix your mortgage? Will paying tuition fees be worth it? What will happen to house prices or the stock market? Without a crystal ball you can\u2019t know for certain. Understanding that there are many shades of grey, and learning to weigh up upsides and downsides in any decision, without panicking, is a skill that keeps on giving. I only wish I had it."}

Melody Gray noted the vehicle was traveling just 25 mph when it unexpectedly went over the curb and into the school property.\nThe Canyons School District said Thursday that classes at the school would not be affected.\nThe incident began just after 9 p.m. Wednesday in the parking lot of Maverik, 7720 S. Main in Midvale. Ray Paul Willie Vasquez, 40, had just bought a drink and was sitting in the driver's seat of his car when a black Jeep Wrangler pulled up and parked next to the victim on the passenger side, Gray said.\nThe driver of the Jeep, Garcia, got out of his vehicle and shot and killed Vasquez, she said.\nInvestigators say the men knew each other and do not believe the attack was random.\nBecause Unified police has a substation nearby, Gray said officers were at the Maverik quickly. Officers soon started pulling over every black Jeep Wrangler in the area, she said.\nOne Jeep that was spotted by several agencies kept eluding officers every time officers got close, Gray said. One officer, however, was able to get a license plate number.\nJust before midnight, Cottonwood Heights police spotted the Jeep again and a chase ensued, Gray said. It went through residential areas before ending up at the elementary school.\nA motive for the shooting had not been established as of Thursday morning.\nAccording to state court records, Garcia had no adult criminal history in Utah.\nVasquez was paroled from the Utah State Prison in December. He was convicted of two counts of sexual abuse of a child, a second-degree felony, and sentenced in 2013 to two terms of one to 15 years to be served consecutively, according to court records."}

{"idx": "23212", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Andrea Levy's narrative switches between four protagonists. The first, Queenie, is Gilbert's white landlady; they met during wartime when he came over as an RAF recruit. Returning on the SS Empire Windrush, he looks her up and takes a room in her house. Hortense, the Jamaican girl whom Gilbert married immediately before boarding the boat, arrives later to share his crumbling attic room; and Queenie's long-lost husband, Bernard, finds his way back, a year after his demob, shortly after Hortense has taken up residence. The year is 1948.\nThe interaction between the couples is, to a certain extent, predictable, but a notable feature of the book is that the entire narrative and the stories within it clearly emerge from the memories of the period's survivors. If ever there was a novel which offered a historically faithful account of how its characters thought and behaved, this is it. But the sheer excellence of Levy's research goes beyond the granddad tales of 50-year-old migrant experience, or the nuts and bolts of historical fact. Her imagination illuminates old stories in a way that almost persuades you she was there at the time.\nHer grip on the language of the characters is another surprise. There is an almost universal confusion in Britain about the nature of Caribbean dialects, and black authors reared in London or Birmingham have tended to reproduce the speech of every sort of Caribbean, regardless of region or class, as the same kind of pop music-inflected street slang, complete with missing consonants and apostrophised accents. Levy has no truck with this sort of gimmick. Instead, she creates a style which reproduces the rhythm and content of her characters' speech. Even more impressive, she does the same for her English characters. Queenie sounds like a Londoner brought up in the early part of the last century. Bernard sounds like a man who has served in the Far East.\nLevy's immersion in the period seems an illustration of the fact that in recent years, 1948, marking the arrival at Tilbury of the Windrush, has taken on a new significance in the lexicon of Britain's social history. A few years ago, the commemoration of this event sparked off a small explosion of interest in the consequences of mid-20th century migration. Artists and writers of migrant origin, especially Afro-Caribbeans, have responded to this historical platform with a new confidence and interest in exploring both their own roots and the circumstances of the time. The result is a growing conversation about the effects of Caribbean migration on British identity.\nLevy's authorial platform is balanced squarely in the middle of this conversation. The novel records some of the most un-pleasant racist aspects of the period, without displaying any sense of polemical intent, partly because her reliance on historical fact gives Levy a distance which allows her to be both dispassionate and compassionate. The history also offers an opportunity to construct the characters in patient and illuminating detail.\nAs you read on, however, it becomes apparent that her relentless layering of their personalities has a more subtle purpose. Hortense, for instance, is the least sympathetic character. Brought up with the consciousness that her \"golden skin\" makes her a superior creature in a country of darker skins, she is a village snob, insecure, narrow-minded, and more or less ignorant. Arriving in England with the expectation that it will be an upmarket version of her teacher-training college in Jamaica, she begins by despising"}

Here's how to stay safe on the trail and in your yard.\nHere's how to avoid getting bitten and discourage them from your property.\nAs Phoenix temperatures flirt with the upper 70s and beyond, those headed outdoors should remember that rattlesnakes like this pleasant weather too.\nHighs near 80 degrees are a trigger for snakes to arouse from hibernation and head out in search of food, water and what passes for companionship for a snake.\nThis can lead to unwelcome interactions between rattlesnakes and people.\nDaniel Marchand, curator with the Phoenix Herpetological Society, said warm weather is like an alarm clock for rattlesnakes.\nWhile many snakes pose no threat to people, there are rattlesnakes and other venomous species in the area. According to the Arizona Game & Fish Department, there are 13 species of rattlesnakes in the state.\nPlaces such as north Scottsdale, Gold Canyon and other areas with lots of open spaces see the most activity. As the weather heats up and dries out, snakes may come closer to homes in search of food and water.\nFortunately, it\u2019s usually not hard to avoid close encounters with rattlesnakes.\nBe aware of the possibility of snakes and be on the lookout. Avoid reaching under rocks or shrubs without looking first. Carry a flashlight when out walking at night.\nIf you\u2019re out hiking it\u2019s important to stay on trails. Those cleared and compacted trails make it easier to spot snakes. Venturing off trail can lead to trouble.\nSnakes blend into their environment. It helps them hunt for prey, but it also makes them harder for people to spot.\nIf you encounter a rattlesnake, the first thing you should do is take a step back, Marchand said.\nA rattlesnake\u2019s strike range is about a third of its body length. In most case that\u2019s about 12-16 inches, he said. For the average adult, taking a step back will usually take you out of harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cMost rattlesnakes around here are only about three feet long,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few snakes around 4 foot or maybe a bit over that, but not many.\nIf you encounter a snake while hiking or biking, leave it alone. Warn other hikers or bikers about what you saw so they can avoid it too.

{"idx": "23214", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Is a focus on curriculum the missing piece in the preparation of teachers?\nThat's the argument made by in a new paper released by Education First, a global education consulting group. It's part of a project, partly funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, bringing together teacher-preparation experts from Finland, Brazil, Australia, and the United States.\nOne of the paper's main insights is that countries like Singapore and Finland tend to base all of their preparation around vetted, high-quality curriculum in a way that the United States and other countries, like Australia, do not.\nIn those countries, \"curriculum explicitly connects teacher preparation to the classroom, and it helps new teachers to learn by providing them with concrete examples of how to teach content and assess student learning against student achievement standards,\" the report notes. \"... Beginning teachers are rarely expected to develop lessons from scratch, but by the time they enter a classroom, they are well versed in how to evaluate, adapt, and use curriculum materials because they have studied and worked with quality curricular materials throughout their education.\"\nBut in the United States, it notes, teacher preparation tends to be curriculum-agnostic and more abstract.\nTo the uninitiated, it may seem like plain ol' common sense to base teacher preparation around high-quality teaching materials. But the nature of the United States' highly decentralized education system means that teacher-preparation programs prepare teachers who will go on to work in potentially dozens if not hundreds of different school districts.\nAs a result, they've tended to avoid teaching students with a specific curriculum, instead favoring general principles or teaching strategies. So budding teachers typically become familiar with specific curricula only when they're in student teaching, typically the very last part of their preparation.\nThe report recommends that those who prepare teachers consider whether their states and districts offer curriculum guides that they can adopt for use in their teaching programs; how they can better help teachers select and recognize good materials from within the extremely diverse marketplace; and explore whether it's possible to use high-quality sample materials themselves to underpin their training.\nFor another, as I've remarked before, there appears to be a newfound appreciation in the U.S. for curriculum given research showing that high quality curriculum can make a difference for student achievement.\nAnd finally, a snarky aside: How, in all these years of people making entire careers of out promoting the \"Finland miracle,\" has no one mentioned the fact that the country's teacher preparation systems don't require teachers to sort through so much junk when they're first getting into the classroom?\nThere are, of course, still challenges to taking this approach in the U.S., not the least of which is the curriculum marketplace in the U.S. is much more vast, and getting larger, and there is so much diversity in what states and districts use.\nBut there are some bright spots, the report's authors say: Louisiana and New York both put a focus on curriculum when they were implementing the Common Core State Standards. Due to that, certain curricula in both states have become very popular among teachers, so there it might be possible for a teaching program to select some exemplars. Other states, like Massachusetts, have detailed curriculum guides, which might be a good place to start.\nLearning First's paper is one in a series on teacher prep.\nMeanwhile, if you're in teacher preparation yourself, do tell us about your thoughts on this really interesting argument. And if you're yourself thinking about the place of good curriculum in teacher preparation, let me know\u2014I'd like to follow up."}

On a giveaway in the Terrier end, senior forward Liam Pecararo provided the feed to classmate Patrick Schule, who fired it past Jake Oettinger to put the Huskies on top.\n\u201cThe first one, [Oettinger] didn\u2019t really have much of a chance on,\u201d said O\u2019Connell after the game.\nBU squandered two early opportunities on the frame\u2019s only power plays, but eventually found their equalizer with 21 seconds to play in the period.\nOn a pass from sophomore forward Shane Bowers, fellow sophomore Cam Crotty launched a wrister towards Northeastern sophomore keeper Cayden Primeau. The puck fell to Joel Farabee alone at the back post where the freshman forward angled the rebound in off Primeau to tally his tenth goal of the season and knot the game at one going into the break.\n\u201cI thought Joel was dynamite,\u201d said O\u2019Connell about his standout freshman.\nIn a scoreless second period, Jake Oettinger came up big with some dazzling saves as pressure poured in from the Huskies. BU gained their best chances towards the end of the frame, but could not capitalize.\nIt was the Terrier goal scorer Farabee who had both opportunities for the Terriers, getting in alone twice within the period\u2019s final five minutes but being denied by Primeau on both occasions. Ahead of the final twenty minutes, the teams would retreat to the locker rooms still tied 1-1.\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to bury those chances, but to put yourself in a situation to get two breakaways in a game, obviously shows a high level of intelligence and skill,\u201d said a positive-minded O\u2019Connell about Farabee\u2019s two missed opportunities.\nThe drama continued into the third period, as the tension mounted the longer the game remained even. Northeastern attempted 34 shots in the final 20 minutes of regulation alone, holding a 48-27 lead in shots on goal after 60 minutes.\n\u201cWe were dominating them, so we had all the confidence,\u201d said Northeastern\u2019s Primeau regarding the mindset of his Huskies during their offensive onslaught in the Terrier end.\nDespite the pressure, Jake Oettinger refused to budge, and both the BU junior and his counterpart Primeau remained strong to keep the game level despite late power plays for both teams in the waning minutes of regulation. The score line would hold after three period of play, and the teams would continue on to overtime.\n\u201cI thought both goalies were outstanding,\u201d said Northeastern head coach Jim Madigan.\nThe additional frame would not last very long, as the Huskies rallied for a"}

Hundreds of other fears and phobias that haunt us are picked up along the way. We each have the ability to fear, and we should be thankful; our survival depends on it. Epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine spur the heart to pump more blood to the muscles and prepare the body to either confront or run from a threat. Fear of fire, of being hit by an SUV traveling at 70 miles per hour, and fear of being eaten motivates us in some very positive ways. The problem is when we get a memory of the fear stored in the amygdala, a grape-size structure at the base of the brain. We can also have a generalized feeling of anxiety quietly invade our life like a malignancy. This makes us lurk at the edges of life hoping merely to survive.\nOver and over again, Jesus told his followers to \u201cfear not.\u201d On our own, this is impossible. Fear is inborn, so daily life in Christ requires replacing old fears with new. The Bible teaches us to fear God, which means nothing less than caring more about what God thinks than what people think. It teaches us that fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Unhealthy fear will not disappear magically, though. With daily focus on the higher, inspirational agenda of God, human fears take their rightful place. Being like Christ means transcending our biology and living as children of our great God.\nHow many enjoyable, noble and significant journeys have you avoided because of fear? How many life-changing plans never materialized because of fear of failure, human opinion or harm? In Matthew 28:10, Jesus gave one last \u201cfear not\u201d to his followers. Less than ten verses later he sent them out to make disciples of every person on the earth; and they went. What is fear keeping you from today?\n1.

Porton Down itself must have been able to synthesize these compounds in order to develop tests for them.

The original source for the story that a new class of organophosphate compounds was developed as chemical weapons under the name Novichok in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s is from Vil Mirzayanov, a defector in the 1990s. Mirzayanov described the chemical structures of these compounds and stated that the toxicity of an agent named Novichuk-5 \u201cunder optimal conditions exceeds the effectiveness of VX by five to eight times\u201d. Mirzayanov alleged that Russian testing and production had continued after signing the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993.\nThe Scientific Advisory Board included Dr Black, and several other heads of national chemical defence laboratories in western countries. These labs would have presumably made their own evaluation of Mirzayanov\u2019s claims and specifically would have done their own experiments to determine if compounds with the structures that he described were of military grade toxicity. Such studies can be done quickly and efficiently in vitro using methods developed for drug discovery (combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening). It is reasonable to assume that if these labs had found that these compounds were potentially usable as chemical weapons, the Scientific Advisory Board would have recommended adding them to the list of Scheduled Chemicals as the Chemical Weapons Convention requires.\nUntil independent confirmation of Mirzayanov\u2019s claims about the toxicity of these compounds is available, and there is an adequate explanation of why the OPCW Scientific Advisory Board did not recommend that the compounds purported to be \u201cNovichoks\u201d and their precursors be designated as scheduled chemicals, it is reasonable to question whether these compounds are military grade nerve agents, or that a Russian \u201cNovichok\u201d programme ever actually existed.\n(2) Who Could Have Synthesized the \u2018Novichok\u2019 Compounds?\nThere are, therefore, only two plausible explanations for what happened in"}

It took a long time for a film version of X-Men to hit the big screen, and the project went through various iterations. James Cameron was once set to produce a version directed by Kathryn Bigelow in the early 1990s, which had Bob Hoskins (Super Mario Bros) lined up to play Wolverine. Russell Crowe was Bryan Singer\u2019s first choice for Wolverine during casting on the 2000 movie, but after he turned it down, Dougray Scott was hired. Schedule overruns on Mission: Impossible 2 forced Scott out of the role, leading to a then-unknown Hugh Jackman being cast instead.\nA lot of fans reacted negatively to Jackman\u2019s hiring, feeling he was miscast and way too tall. His performance won them over, however, and he would come to define the character for a generation of fans. After playing the role nine times, Jackman decided to hang up his claws with 2017\u2019s Logan. This was a wise choice since both the film and his performance were praised. Despite fans hoping he could be convinced to return for a crossover with The Avengers or Deadpool, Jackman is sticking firmly to his retirement vow.\nWith the part now vacant, fans are speculating about who could inherit the mutton chops, and Daniel Radcliffe accidentally threw his name into the ring last week by making a joke about being cast in the role. In a new chat with IGN, Radcliffe seemed to lament how far his tongue-in-cheek Wolverine comment had gone.\nThis is what happens when you make jokes. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could just start casting yourself in things by just saying them in interviews? So I guess people have been asking something about me and Wolverine, and I made a joke about [playing] Wolverine after being in a hot wash, like I\u2019d been shrunk in a hot wash, and the internet seems to think that I was putting that out there on my dream board cosmic ordering system.\nLater in the interview, he added, \"But there\u2019s no truth in it,\" just to underline his point. Radcliffe\u2019s original comment was clearly intended to be a joke, but it took root surprisingly fast. Even fan artist BossLogic was quick to put together a picture showing what Radcliffe's take on Wolverine could look like. Since finishing his run with the Harry Potter franchise, Radcliffe has racked up an impressively divisive number of roles, appearing in everything from romantic comedies to dark dramas. In truth, he could be an interesting, left-field choice, but even if he was approached, he might be wary of signing on for another long commitment to a major franchise.\nIt seems increasingly likely the X-Men universe will be rebooted following the Fox/Disney deal, with Dark Phoenix and New Mutants likely to be the final entries in the current franchise. There are also reports the troubled New Mutants might bypass cinemas entirely and go straight to Hulu instead. The X-Men will almost certainly be rebooted within the MCU, where Kevin Feige will need to find the next Wolverine. Jackman has really come to define the part, so the next performer will have to work hard to win over the fanbase. Jon Bernthal and Zac Efron are two current favorites, but that\u2019s likely a question Feige hasn\u2019t had much time to contemplate just yet.\nMore: Cast"}

What's more, the edible-vaccine research highlights some of the potentially positive elements of so-called \"Frankenfoods.\"\n\"There are a lot of people worried about genetically modified foods, but I think this helps to highlight some of the potential benefits,\" says Dr. Steven Wesselingh, head of Alfred Hospital's infectious diseases unit, which is conducting the measles research.\nIn tests conducted of greenhouse-grown, vaccine-laden tobacco and lettuce, mice eating the stuff began producing desired measles antibodies, Wesselingh said. Also, he added, the tobacco and lettuce plants produced the measles virus gene for the H-protein in just the right fashion. That surprised researchers who had expected more trouble in getting the process just right.\nMuch additional work needs to be done, including moving trials up the animal chain to monkeys and, eventually, humans. But the Alfred Hospital researchers are so encouraged they're starting early work on how vaccines for viruses such as HIV might be delivered via food, he said.\nElsewhere, most notably at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, promising research has also been conducted into food-delivered oral vaccines against hepatitis B, e. coli, and diarrheal illnesses, \u00adprimarily through a genetically engineered potato.\nInstitute spokesman Dwayne Kirk said that, over time, bananas, tomatoes, or a host of other foods might be used to deliver vaccines. Various powders might also be developed one day so vaccines could be mixed with liquids and swallowed, he said.\nThe vaccines wouldn't enter the general food supply, Kirk stressed.\n\"As far as environmental pollution or people worrying about consuming foods when they don't know what's in them, that just wouldn't apply,\" Kirk said. \"These vaccine-carrying plants would be grown and dispensed under controlled conditions.\"\nJohn Fleming, director of the Southern Cross Bioethics Center in Adelaide, South Australia, said the research looked promising, but many questions remain.\n\"For instance, we can't actually feed much of the Third World at present, and so why are we thinking of now immunizing them with food?\" he said.\nBut he acknowledged the vaccine-food idea may have potential long-term merit, if dosages can be strictly controlled, plants are kept under tight quarantine, and adequate health and safety oversight is maintained.\nRobert Phelps, director of the Australian Gene Ethics Network, was also cautiously optimistic. \"Research in this area clearly has far to go, and it should be kept in that perspective,\" Phelps said. \"There needs to be open, transparent, and thorough public review of its safety, efficacy, social, and ethical aspects.\"\n\"For example, if the product is patented, it may be quite beyond the reach of the people in need,\" he said."}

That\u2019s essentially what Richardson did here, by pulling out of the Commerce Department post\u2014a grand-jury investigation into political favors-trading by his office boiled hotter than he had anticipated, so he took himself out before he could do himself or the President-elect any harm. Embarrassing, perhaps, but not a big deal. The Obama team\u2019s second process error, however\u2014failing to consult Diane Feinstein, the incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2014about a decision to appoint an inexperienced fellow California pol, Leon Panetta, to head the C.I.A., well, that\u2019s a gangly unforced error. Heads need not roll, perhaps, but one or two ought to be bowed in humility.\nAs to the Panetta appointment itself, it is unconvincing. The C.I.A. directorship is a diminished post, no longer in charge of the full intelligence community and subordinate to the Director of National Intelligence (who will apparently be Dennis Blair, a retired admiral.) Still, the C.I.A. director has four important jobs: manage the White House relationship; manage Congress, particularly to obtain budgetary favor; manage the agency\u2019s workforce and daily operations; and manage liaisons with other spy chiefs, friendly and unfriendly. Panetta is thoroughly qualified for the first two functions but unqualified for the latter two. He seems to have been selected as a kind of political auditor and consensus builder. He will make sure the White House is protected from surprises or risks emanating from C.I.A. operations; he will ensure that interrogation and detention practices change, and that the Democratic Congress is satisfied by those changes; he will ensure that all of this occurs with a minimum of disruptive bloodletting. All good, but it is not enough. The essential problem is that Panetta is a man of Washington, not a man of the world. He\u2019s seventy-years-old, spends his time on his California farm, and he\u2019s been out of the deal flow, as they say on Wall Street, for about a decade; he knows California budget policy like the back of his hand, but what intuition or insight does he bring to the most dangerous territories in American foreign policy\u2014Anbar Province, the Logar Valley, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas? Compared to his counterparts in Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, Britain, etc.\u2014the critical relationships in national security that the C.I.A. Director alone can manage\u2014he is a relative novice not only about intelligence operations but also about the foreign-policy contexts in which they occur. The country needs a better clandestine service. The C.I.A. has taken in an unusually talented pool of young case officers who volunteered after September 11th\u2014probably as good a young talent pool as the government has had since the nineteen-sixties. But the agency they signed up for has been battered around and led by revolving door"}
{"idx": "23262", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: \"Today the Government worked with the Senate crossbench to extend the opt-out period for My Health Record,\" said health minister Greg Hunt in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.\nHe confirmed that the opt-out period, due to end this Thursday, will now end on January 31. This gives Australians nearly seven more weeks to opt out of the controversial centralised digital health records system before a record is created for them automatically.\nUntil now the government had been blocking all calls for an extension.\nOn Monday, the Senate voted to call on the government to extend the opt-out period indefinitely, and to halt to roll-out of the system until \"public confidence [had] been restored\". Hunt ignored it.\nOn Wednesday morning, Senate debate on the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018 began. A Labor amendment to extend the opt-out period for a further 12 months was defeated 32-30. However minutes later, an amendment moved by One Nation leader senator Pauline Hanson for the January 31 extension was passed on the voices.\n\"Labor's plan to delay and derail the roll-out of the My Health Record was blocked today,\" Hunt said, continuing his habit of framing criticism of the My Health Record system as party politics.\n\"We thank the crossbench for not delaying this important policy change as Labor tried so desperately to do,\" he said.\nThe government has also introduced further amendments to the legislation, intended to implement the changes announced last week.\nThey include strengthening the safeguards in cases of domestic violence; banning employers from requesting and using private health information; and banning health information being released to insurers, even if de-identified.\nThe government has also proposed the establishment of a Data Governance Board to oversee the secondary use of My Health Record data -- that is, uses beyond the health records needs of individuals.\nTake steps \"to ensure the ongoing protection of de-identified data and health information used by, or disclosed to, persons for research or public health purposes and that the data and information is being used and disclosed only for those purposes\".\nThe board would consist of a chair and deputy chair, plus between 7 and 10 other members. This would include representatives of the ADHA and the data custodian, which is the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, as well as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person.\nAll board members would need to have skills or experience on, or knowledge of, at least one of population health and epidemiology; medical or health research; health services delivery; technology; data science; data governance; privacy; or consumer advocacy.\nThis proposal would seem to address some of the concerns raised by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. The board would be able to oversee the so-called \"secondary use framework\" in a more interactive way than writing the rules themselves into legislation.\nSome of the Senate committee's 14 recommendations have still not been addressed directly, however, in particular the call to apply access codes to each My Health Record as a default.\nCoalition senators had included a dissenting statement in the Senate report, claiming among other things that this would \"in practical terms effectively return the My Health Record to an opt-in participation model\".\nThe government has consistently and strongly rejected the call for an opt-in model."}

The statistics from the other schools were not much better, reflecting the oft-overlooked fact that schools across America are more segregated now than they were decades ago, before the landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.\nIf these high-performing schools are made up primarily of white and Asian students, what do other schools in New York on the other end of the spectrum look like?\nThree days a week, I work part-time as a math teacher at an underperforming middle school in the Bronx, where 99 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, and 93 percent of the student body is black and Hispanic.\nIt is easy to read these statistics and classify these students as a monolith of poor performance and struggle, and it is true that most of the students face difficulties both in school and outside in their homes and communities. But they are bright, curious, passionate and perceptive about the realities they face in their day-to-day lives.\nWhen I first began teaching, the students expressed disdain for their new classes with me, peppering me with questions and protests. They complained of being in this class because they are \u201cstupid,\u201d that even if they tried their hardest, they would never fully comprehend the material at hand. They told me about the school culture and climate, one they saw as having a lack of trust and mutual respect between students and teachers, and slowly I have begun to see things from their perspective.\nIn the school building, all of the classroom doors are locked, presumably to prevent students from stealing calculators or other teaching materials. There is no hall break, and students have exactly one minute to get from one class to another, for fear of them loitering in the halls and getting into trouble.\nThere are timed water breaks, bathroom passes, and more \u2014 demonstrating that students are not trusted to maneuver through their school days on their own. This leads to an environment that far from motivating students to cooperate and focus on the lesson at hand, causes them to feel unvalued, which later can be seen when they lash out and act up in ways that come off as disrespectful.\nThe discordant relationships that the kids have with other teachers and staff is not the only reason they act in ways not conducive to positive learning. When I ask the kids about their home lives, it is slowly revealed that school is not the only place where they are not given the proper tools to thrive. One of my students told me that the reason why she was acting up was because her home had recently burned down and she was worried that her and her family would soon end up homeless.\nAnother told me that she and many more of her classmates suffer from anxiety and depression as a result of unfavorable conditions at home, but they have no place to talk about these issues, seeing as the school can\u2019t provide adequate social support for the students.\nMy difficult day ends when I leave school and go back to a home that I consider safe, stable and supportive \u2014 a luxury and privilege many of my students are unable to experience.\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to focus on only negative aspects of my school\u2019s culture.

{"idx": "23267", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Gaza is a coastal strip of land that lay on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore.\nHeld by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by two million Palestinians.\nTens of thousands of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after fleeing or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of refugees saw Gaza's population triple to around 200,000.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s armed Palestinian 'fedayeen' - many of them refugees - mounted attacks into Israel, drawing reprisals. The United Nations set up a refugee agency, UNRWA, which today provides services for 1.3 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza, around 70 per cent of the population, as well as for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank.\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. An Israeli census that year put Gaza's population at 394,000, at least 60 percent of them refugees. It found that 65 percent of working-age men in the 145 sq. mile (375 sq. km) territory were employed in Gaza before the 1967 conflict, mainly in agriculture, fishing, industry and quarries.\nTwenty years after the 1967 war, Palestinians launched their first intifada, or uprising. It began in December 1987 after a traffic accident in which an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp, killing four. Stone-throwing protests, strikes and shutdowns followed.\nSeizing the angry mood, the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood created an armed Palestinian branch - Hamas - with its power base in Gaza. Hamas, dedicated to Israel's destruction and restoration of Islamic rule in what it saw as occupied Palestine, became a rival to Yasser Arafat's secular Fatah party that led the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nHamas and Islamic Jihad carried out bombings to try to derail the peace process, leading Israel to impose more restrictions on movement of Palestinians out of Gaza. Hamas also picked up on growing Palestinian criticisms of corruption, nepotism and economic mismanagement by Arafat's inner circle.\nOne casualty was Gaza International Airport, a symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for economic independence and the Palestinians' only direct link to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel or Egypt. Opened in 1998, was deemed a security threat by Israel three years later. Israel destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.\nAnother casualty was Gaza's fishing industry, a source of income for tens of thousands. Gaza's fishing zone, set by the Oslo deals at 20 nautical miles, was reduced by Israel to between three and 12 nautical miles. Israel said the restrictions were necessary to stop boats smuggling weapons. Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on Oslo.\nPalestinians tore down the abandoned buildings and infrastructure for scrap. The settlements' removal led to greater"}

Testing.... Photograph courtesy District Department of Transportation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in the last four minutes of the fourth quarter,\u201d said Ronaldo \u201cNick\u201d Nicholson, the chief engineer of DC\u2019s streetcar system, comparing the project to a football game. But based on the latest foggy estimates of when the system might start running, DC\u2019s first streetcars in half a century are still well outside the goal line.\nJust a few months ago, the District Department of Transportation was telling city residents to prepare for streetcar service along H St., Northeast, as soon as December. But now, that\u2019s the target for the beginning of a long testing phase of a transit line that has been worked on for more than half a decade and already cost $161 million.\nBefore residents can start riding between Union Station and Anacostia, DDOT will have to put the streetcar tracks and trolleys through months of exhaustive testing, making it unlikely that passenger service will begin before late spring or early summer. Ron Garraffa, the streetcar system\u2019s deputy director for engineering and construction, said the 2.2-mile line along busy streets\u2014trolleys will be competing for space with cars, buses, and bicycles\u2014will take longer to approve than light-rail systems in other cities. Garraffa compared the DC line to one in Tampa, Florida that opened in 2002 after nearly four months of testing.\nIf Garraffa\u2019s example holds up, the testing phase for DC\u2019s streetcar line could last well into the spring before it obtains local and federal safety approval. From there, it would be up to another 30 days before the cars start running.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be very cautious,\u201d Nicholson told reporters. \u201cOur goal is to complete the system and get it safe.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s hedging about giving a firm date contrasts with previous updates from DC officials, who for years have been promising streetcar service at various dates, only to later inform the public about more delays.\nOne of the latest hiccups is the historic preservation of Spingarn High School, forcing DDOT to redraw its plans for a car barn there and adding another $29 million to the streetcar system\u2019s cost. There are also questions over how many cars will be rolling on the tracks when the system finally opens for public use.\nDDOT is aiming for five cars, which would arrive at stations at 10-minute intervals, but is still waiting for delivery of several cars, which will then need to be inspected and put through tests.\nSince July 2009, when crews started digging up H St. to lay down the first lengths of rail, the streetcar line has sputtered toward completion. The next addition, possibly beginning this week, is the erection of catenary poles to carry the overhead wires that will power the cars.\nDDOT also has a hefty public relations campaign on its plate, as it will need to figure out how to prevent cars from double-parking on top of the tracks, warn pedestrians about jaywalking when streetcars are approaching, and accommodate businesses that say delivery schedlues will be impeded by passing trolleys.\nBut Nicholson defended the slow, bit-by-bit approach. \u201cI think we did this right,\u201d he said. The system\u2019s riders and the neighborhood\u2019s residents will determine that, whenever the streetcar opens."}

We will examine how Dani Shapiro, Vladimir Nabokov, Eula Biss, Christina Crosby, and Lidia Yuknavitch, among others, use frankness, compassion, humor, and elements of fiction in their memoirs and personal essays to draw their readers in and make their stories vivid.

Since clinching the nomination in June, Clinton pulled back from the traditional rules of engagement for a major-party nominee, preferring to avoid unpredictable exchanges with voters and restricting her meetings with journalists.\nShe has not held a town hall to take questions from voters in more than six weeks. The campaign has continued to carefully vet the voters she meets for roundtable discussions, and rarely does Clinton walk into a room without knowing who will be in it.\nShe has largely maintained her distance from journalists, too, prohibiting the media from entering her fundraisers and traveling the country in a separate press plane from her press corps, though there are plans to start a press plane soon. And she has mostly managed to avoid discussing FBI Director James Comey\u2019s harsh assessment of her use of a private email server as secretary of state.\nInstead of leaving her campaign to chance, Clinton has carefully controlled her public image through favorable interviews like her campaign\u2019s podcast, \u201cWith Her,\u201d curated social media posts and meticulously planned appearances with voters.\nClinton\u2019s cautious strategy is not new. In many respects, it is simply an enhancement on what Barack Obama deployed in 2008 and 2012. But with a comfortable lead in enough swing states to vault her to the White House if the election were held today, Clinton has retreated further into a bubble to avoid the sort of self-inflicted errors that have plagued her bombastic GOP rival.\nIn short, with a solid lead in the polls, the guiding mantra of Clinton\u2019s campaign follows the Hippocratic oath: do no harm.\nThe Clinton campaign disputes the notion that she has avoided voters and the national press corps, pointing to her surprise visits to coffee shops and unscripted discussions with business owners.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it as caution, we see it as discipline,\u201d said spokesman Nick Merrill, who also said she has held \u201cnearly 400 interviews\u201d with local and national media amounting to \u201cseveral thousand questions from the press\u201d so far this year. Aides highlight her commitment to preparation for even the most casual encounter as a sign of presidential temperament, in comparison to Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling style.\nA typical campaign stop for Clinton is a predictable affair, involving a visit into friendly territory and limited interaction with the media.\nOn a visit last week to Des Moines, Iowa, for example Clinton stopped at a millennial-owned clothing company called Raygun whose owner store, Mike Draper, wore a t-shirt that said \u201cAMERICA: HILL YES.\u201d Clinton and Draper, in conversation, agreed that U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez was a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d Though she visited a coffee shop across the street unannounced and without knowing who the clientele would be, she said little to the press beyond the suggestion that reporters should try the coffee she was drinking.\nSuch visits with local business owners, voters and community leaders occur several times a week, but usually in controlled settings. The coffee shops and manufacturing facilities Clinton tours are carefully selected ahead of time by her campaign\u2019s advance team, and she rarely takes shouted questions from the pack of press following her.\nClinton\u2019s remove from her reporters has been in stark contrast to her media-friendly rival, who has held frequent press conferences and has made himself available to reporters and television interviewers.

His wife, Maria Novikova, and their two sons, Dmitry and Yevgeny, were reportedly with him when he died.\nYevtushenko\u2019s poems of protest, often declaimed with sweeping gestures to thousands of excited admirers in public squares, sports stadiums and lecture halls, captured the tangled emotions of Russia\u2019s young \u2013 hope, fear, anger and euphoric anticipation \u2013 as the country struggled to free itself from repression during the tense, confused years after Joseph Stalin\u2019s death in 1953.

Among the others were Andrei Voznesensky, Robert Rozhdestvensky and Bella Akhmadulina, Yevtushenko\u2019s first wife.\nBut Yevtushenko did so working mostly within the system, taking care not to join the ranks of outright literary dissidents. By stopping short of the line between defiance and resistance, he enjoyed a measure of official approval that more daring dissidents came to resent.\nWhile they were subjected to exile or labour camps, Yevtushenko was given state awards, his books were regularly published, and he was allowed to travel abroad, becoming an international literary superstar.\nSome critics had doubts about his sincerity as a foe of tyranny. A few enemies even suggested that he was merely posing as a protester to serve the security police or the Communist authorities.\nYevtushenko\u2019s defenders bristled at such attacks, pointing out how much he did to oppose the Stalin legacy, an animus fuelled by the knowledge that both of his grandfathers had perished in Stalin\u2019s purges of the 1930s.\nHe was expelled from his university in 1956 for joining the defence of a banned novel, Vladimir Dudintsev\u2019s Not by Bread Alone. He refused to join in the official campaign against Boris Pasternak, the author of Doctor Zhivago and the recipient of the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature.

The Captain advances the power while the brakes are held. Engine instruments checked, automatic control of the throttles engaged, and the brakes are released.\nThe computer pushes the engines to maximum takeoff power, and the aircraft begins its rapid acceleration down the runway. With over half of the runway behind it, and accelerating through 140 MPH, an engine fails. \u201cIs there enough runway to stop?\u201d \u201cCan the aircraft takeoff on the one remaining engine?\u201d \u201cWill it clear the trees at the edge of the airport?\u201d The crew is faced with this daunting choice, and they react quickly. It may seem like one has to consider all these factors, or even rely on gut instinct. But in fact, the decision has already been made.\nEngine failure on takeoff is a situation that all pilots both dread and train for. In small twin-engined aircraft, when an engine fails on the takeoff roll, the remaining engine is brought to idle, and the aircraft is stopped on the runway. If the engine quits just after takeoff, the pilot may have enough runway available to still land safely. There is a point, based on the judgment of the pilot, that sufficient runway is unavailable. At this point, the landing gear is retracted, and the pilot would continue to climb out on the remaining engine. Many of these principles apply to large turbojet aircraft, though the total picture is far more complex.\nReverse thrust being applied on an EasyJet Airbus.\nPer FAA regulations, an airliner must be able to either abort the takeoff and stop on the runway, or continue with the takeoff and climb out on the remaining engine. There is a point, or rather a speed that defines this point in which the aircraft can safely either be stopped or continue with the takeoff. This is commonly referred to as decision speed.\nDecision speed, which pilots refer to as V1, is calculated for every takeoff. Unlike the pilot of a small piston twin who must make a judgment call when the engine quits, the Captain of an airliner relies on the science, testing, and calculations from which the decision speed is derived.\nDecision speed falls within a range of speeds; the highest of this range is based on the ability of the aircraft\u2019s brakes, which is especially relevant on older intercontinental airliners. Passing through 160 MPH, these aircraft simply have insufficient braking capability to stop. If the Captain were to abort above this speed, the brakes would heat rapidly, melt, and around 60 MPH, simply cease to exist. Off runway terrain and obstructions would eventually bring the heavy aircraft to a halt.\nThe lowest of this range is based on the minimum speed of which the aircraft is controllable with the failure of one engine. When an engine fails, the remaining engine will make the aircraft turn in the direction of the failed engine. This yaw is counteracted by the pilot\u2019s application of the rudder, which directs the airflow over the tail, counteracting the yaw from the engine. Whereas the force of the thrust from the engine remains relatively constant during the takeoff, the amount of force the rudder can generate is entirely dependant on the aircraft\u2019s speed. The higher the speed, the greater amount of airflow over the tail, and thus the greater the"}

She gets her energy from talking to people.\nAnd, hey, I think Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker may be one of the best governors in the nation. That\u2019s an idea that would make my friend Cheri a bit nauseous.\nBut if I still lived in her district, she would get my vote. Why? Well, for the same reason I\u2019ve voted for people like former U.S. Sens. Paul Simon and Alan Dixon over the years.\nThey often weren\u2019t ideologically in line with me. But I voted for them because they were good people.\nAfter covering politics for 30 years, I can tell you that politics attracts a lot of cruddy humans. We\u2019re talking about folks in both parties who are in love with themselves but are unable to reach for common ground with those with whom they disagree.\nWe are talking about Republicans who would defend a president who talks about not wanting black immigrants from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d That\u2019s indefensible. But many in the GOP defend it. Why? Because Donald Trump is a Republican. He\u2019s also a bad person.\nThe same could be said for many Democrats who refused to criticize Bill Clinton\u2019s lack of personal propriety, but are quick to condemn Republicans for theirs.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to elect good people. Both Republicans and Democrats.\nSince both Cheri and I come from a long line of hog farmers, I\u2019ll use this analogy: You can\u2019t make a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear.\nIt\u2019s an embarrassment that the Affordable Care Act passed without a Republican vote. It\u2019s equally bad that the recent tax reform package passed without a single Democrat vote.\nBoth parties have something to offer. They represent constituencies that need to be heard.\nBy contrast, in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson pushed for creating Medicare, a majority of House Republicans supported him. And when Ronald Reagan campaigned for tax reform in 1986, most Democrats in Congress backed him.\nBut something has happened in the political culture that is making such bi-partisan deals a near impossibility.\nThe biggest reason is that congressional districts are now drawn with such precision that almost all of them are preordained to elect either a Republican or a Democrat. That means that members of congress from those districts can ignore the concerns of voters of the minority party of their district.\nNonetheless, it is one of a handful of congressional districts where either a Republican or a Democrat can win. And Bustos has found a formula for success in such a district. She listens to her constituents and has avoided the \u201celitist\u201d trappings of many Democrats.\nHere\u2019s an example of that elitism.

All come with fenders, racks for cargo, fully covered chains and wide, comfortable seats.\n\"The bikes we sell, you won't find in general bike shops,\" said Josef Bray-Ali, 30. \"For one, these bikes are comfortable, and they don't jar you around like most performance bikes people sometimes get talked into buying. But most people aren't as used to this idea of the bike as a durable good and a real, daily mode of transportation in L.A.\"\nFlying Pigeons run $300 to $700, depending on the model and appointments. The Dutch bikes, by brands Batvus and Gazelle, sell for about $700 to $1,400 each. The shop also sells a basic road bike: the $349 Torker U-District, which features a flip-flop rear-wheel hub, so owners can choose between fixed-gear and single-speed riding.\nThe brothers also rent bikes for the ride for $10.\nIn addition to the dim sum outing, the Bray-Ali brothers host an art gallery ride the second Saturday of each month. Unlike the dim sum trips, which attract families and middle-aged participants, the Spoke(n)Art Ride brings out a younger crowd more akin to the hipster, fixed-gear riders in their 20s and 30s that make up most of the packs venturing around Los Angeles.\nAlthough the organized rides have attracted a lot of attention, not too many Pigeons fly out the door after the treks, Adam Bray-Ali said.\n\"As a marketing tool, it's great,\" the 35-year-old entrepreneur said. \"But it hasn't yet translated into direct sales.\"\nStill, the rides haven't been a waste of time. They have helped build a rider community in northeast Los Angeles and have led to word of mouth that has spread virally on the Internet, attracting buyers to the shop, Josef Bray-Ali said.\n\"People drive in from Venice, Malibu, Santa Monica to buy the Chinese and Dutch bikes because we're the only guys in the city who sell them,\" he said. \"Usually they've been to Europe or Asia, and they look at bikes a little different than Americans.\"\nOver the last year, Flying Pigeon has brought in $150,000 in gross revenue, said the brothers, who are the shop's only employees.\nFlying Pigeon's main competitor,"}

But they are restricted to public transit used by adults. Why can\u2019t a similar app exist for public school buses, likely the most widely used public-transit system in the United States? And, more specifically, why can\u2019t prospective homeowners or renters easily learn the school bus times associated with different properties?\nFor many well-documented reasons concerning the health, education, and safety of their children (a compendium of such resources may be found at StartSchoolLater.net), many parents don\u2019t want to live in a neighborhood where their children would have to board predawn buses for most of the school year. For example, Fairfax County, Va., and Montgomery County, Md.,\u2014both Washington suburbs\u2014have large parent-dominated movements seeking later bus and high school start times. Most Fairfax public high school students start their day at 7:20 a.m.; Montgomery\u2019s, at 7:25 a.m. Many buses start their routes an hour before schools start, and Fairfax has one bus that starts as early as 5:45 a.m. Seeking later start times, thousands of Fairfax County and Montgomery County residents have recently signed petitions pressing for change.\nSchool districts assert that they cannot publicly release school bus-route data because it would be used by child predators. But I haven\u2019t been able to find a single piece of evidence to back up this claim. The defense also appears remarkably arbitrary: It would be easy for a motivated stranger to learn when buses arrive for kids, and countless after-school activities, including outdoor sports, already widely publicize their schedules.\nA better explanation for the lack of public bus-route data is that school districts recognize that predawn bus routes reflect child-unfriendly budget priorities.\nConsider this: I took a list of the nation\u2019s \u201ctop 20 prep schools,\u201d as selected by Forbes magazine in 2010, and looked up when their days began\u2014not one started regular classroom instruction before 8 a.m. At the same time, many poor public school districts also can somehow afford later start times.\n\"Many parents don\u2019t want to live in a neighborhood where their children would have to board predawn buses for most of the school year.\"\nReflecting the political embarrassment associated with early bus routes, not only are the final bus routes publicized as little as possible, but the whole process of establishing such routes is often shrouded in secrecy.\nThe primary driver of ever-earlier bus routes (and corresponding early school start times) is transportation-cost reduction. Using a single bus for as many routes and pickups as possible saves money. Consider a district that finds itself with a budget shortfall.\nSince the transportation budget is discretionary and lacks a well-organized constituency to protect it, it\u2019s a prime target for raiding, which leads to earlier bus times. Meanwhile, to minimize opposition, districts give parents minimal public notice of the proposed changes.\nThose harmed the most are typically the poorest, most educationally at risk students. Others, usually the most privileged, can compensate thanks to parents who either buy cars for their kids or drive their children to school.\nAs part of the Obama administration\u2019s push for data-driven public school accountability, public school systems should be required to disclose their bus-route data in a well-structured, standardized format on the Internet, just as public-transit systems already do.\nSimilarly, the process"}

Both men lived in Phoenix, where they\u2019d settled after making their separate ways north from the Mexican farming village of Colonia Emilio Carranza many years earlier. Salazar and his family came across legally in 1974, while de la Fuente arrived during the 1990s, traversing the desert on foot to cross the border illegally near Nogales, Arizona. De la Fuente, a plumber, and Salazar, a delivery driver, eventually became good friends. Their families grew close, too, often spending weekends and holidays together.\nBut that all changed one morning in May 2009, when Salazar asked de la Fuente for a ride to the ATM. They hopped into de la Fuente\u2019s green Nissan Maxima and drove to a nearby Wells Fargo. As they were about to turn into the parking lot, a Phoenix squad car driving behind them hit its flashers.\nBy Salazar\u2019s account, officer Matthew Prutch asked de la Fuente for a driver\u2019s license. When he produced a fake, Prutch had him step out of the car and handcuffed him. Salazar asked the officer whether he\u2019d pulled them over because of their skin color; Prutch, he says, replied that he was just doing his job. (In his report [PDF], Prutch wrote that he ran the Nissan\u2019s plates while following the car and found no driver\u2019s license data associated with the registered owner. \u201cHe appeared to be a Hispanic male,\u201d Prutch added, \u201cand under reasonable suspicion I believe [sic] the driver to be driving with no valid license.\u201d) Minutes later, another officer arrived and asked Salazar for his license, even though he hadn\u2019t been at the wheel. Prutch then delivered de la Fuente to the police station for booking. From there, the 35-year-old was taken to Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s notorious Durango Jail, and charged with using a fake ID.

Four days later, after intense pressure, then-president Jacob Zuma rescinded his appointment, shifted him to the co-operative governance and traditional affairs department and appointed Pravin Gordhan to control the nation\u2019s purse strings.\nThose few days were the culmination of years of reports about the influence of the Gupta family in running South Africa. To many, Van Rooyen, who had visited the Guptas\u2019 Saxonwold compound seven days in a row before his appointment, represents the epitome of state capture.\nInvestigators for the Zondo commission of enquiry into state capture have been tasked to discover what exactly Van Rooyen did during his tenure as finance minister.\nHe was at the helm of the treasury for just one day but reports indicate that it took mere hours for Van Rooyen to feed information to the Guptas.\nHe has repeatedly insisted that he signed \u201cno deals\u201d during his term as finance minister but of particular interest to investigators is to find out how a confidential presentation meant for the Cabinet ended up with Trillian chief executive Eric Wood, and was later passed on to Gupta business associate and lieutenant Salim Essa.\nVan Rooyen received the presentation from former director general Lungisa Fuzile, who is one of four current and former treasury officials who have been approached by the commission\u2019s investigators to give statements and consider testifying.\nThis week, testimony from key witnesses before the commission detailed how unfettered access to key government information, including departmental budgets, sensitive government strategy and procurement spending plans was instrumental to state capture.\nFormer senior civil servant Themba Maseko and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor revealed how the Gupta family seemed to have intimate knowledge of government information, including of the government\u2019s advertising budget, and used it to secure business deals with national departments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\nVan Rooyen is a central figure in the allegations of state capture in both his capacity as short-lived finance minister and his longer tenure as co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister.\nVan Rooyen, still a staunch Zuma supporter and defender, arrived at the treasury with two advisers, Ian Whitley and Mohamed Bobat, who were allegedly handpicked by the Guptas. At the time Whitley was ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte\u2019s son-in-law.\nBobat was employed by Gupta-linked Trillian at the time of Van Rooyen\u2019s appointment as finance minister. He later played a key role in drafting crucial proposals from Trillian to the department of co-operative governance to help tier-two municipalities to access debt on capital markets to pay for infrastructure projects, as well as the establishment of a national black bank with which the government would conduct all its business.\nThe Sunday Times previously reported that Bobat was the adviser who shared the confidential document with Wood.\nThis week, Fuzile would not say what the investigators wanted from him or whether he would testify about Van Rooyen.\nOfficials expected to testify at the commission have been sworn to secrecy and cannot divulge any information about their testimonies. But a government source said the document Fuzile passed to Van Rooyen was not supposed to be shared even with his own advisers \u2014 it was confidential and meant for the Cabinet only.

{"idx": "23311", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Despite the \u2018dead season\u2019 in Parliament, the factions have declared the transfer season open. Following on from the shifts in the governmental coalition, the rotation process now appears to have started in the opposition as well with four MPs leaving the United National Movement (UNM) this week. After Zurab Japaridze, Pavle Kublashvili, Giorgi Meladze and Goga Khachidze withdrew from the UNM, a summer transfer was announced on two MP votes in Parliament. This is the number of votes that the four MPs need in order to form a new faction in Parliament and, as they say, attack the Georgian Dream majority with new vigor.\nUnlike sports, hunting for \u2018stars\u2019 is slightly different in the Georgian Parliament. There, moving from one team to another does not happen at once and mostly depends on who has what influence on this or that political process. As the Georgian media was fast to spread: former Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili, currently imprisoned, stands behind the four recent leavers and plans on starting his own independent political game.\nEditor of newspaper \u201cKronika+\u201d Eliso Kiladze claims that Vano Merabishvili\u2019s team needs MPs in Parliament who will serve their interests: \u201cMP Kakha Okriashvili and ex-governor Tsezar Chocheli plan to establish a new political party. These people are associated with UNM member and Secretary General of the party, Vano Merabishvili. I do not exclude that the four MPs who left the UNM party are cooperating with the new party that is associated with Merabishvili,\u201d Kiladze said.\nThe four ex-UNM MPs have not hidden the fact that they plan to form a new party and do not intend to cooperate with other parties. However, the first thing they need to do is to convince two more MPs to join them in order to form a new faction. Former UNM MP Goga Khachidze says that the four have already selected candidates and will soon make those names public. \u201cWe will form a faction. We will see who joins us; we cannot reveal it now. Of course, we are in consultation with the relevant groups of MPs. There are thick dividing lines related to the country\u2019s foreign policy orientation. This is a natural political process. When you have a faction, there are more opportunities in parliamentary work as well, generally, in terms of the tribune. It is essential that when you are a politician, you have to make sure to expand and create certain opportunities,\u201d Khachidze said.\nThe chairman of the United National Movement, as of Georgia Today going to print, had not yet responded to the latest events; though other \u2018faces\u2019 of the UNM had commented on the decision of the four leavers. If we judge from the photos of the former president taken in Warsaw at the UEFA finals posted on social networks, there is an impression that Saakashvili where these wandering free agents will end up, unlike other \u2018stars\u2019 of UNM who call the withdrawal of the four from the party irresponsible and infantile. Due to the situation, the unusual silence of Saakashvili can be even justified and, as MP Nadirashvili said, the final result of this ado might be instead the smiling faces of Prime Minister Garibashvili\u2019s government.\nThis way or that, following the withdrawal of the four from the UNM party, another reality is created in the oppositional wing of the parliament. And this will create a precondition for establishing a large pro-western coalition within Parliament.\nPolitical scientist Khatuna Lag"}
{"idx": "23312", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In late August 1921, long-running tensions between pro-union miners and anti-union West Virginia coal operators erupted into an armed confrontation totaling well over 10,000 men, a mess of bullets and a still-unconfirmed number of dead and wounded during five days of gunfighting at a spot called Blair Mountain. It was, in terms of people involved, the largest violent showdown between capital and labor in U.S. history.\nIf American labor had holy sites, Blair Mountain would be among them (as would Ludlow, Colo., scene of the infamous 1914 Ludlow Massacre, part of a coal strike that involved some of the same actors in the West Virginia coal battles). But coal mining is still done in West Virginia, and Blair Mountain is on mining companies' list of targets.\nA decidedly smaller group of people are fighting over Blair Mountain now, but its very existence hangs in the balance. Labor and history activists sought more than five years ago to have Blair Mountain added to the National Register of Historic Places. After an initial survey of property owners' opinions, the federal government determined that a majority of them supported adding the designation, and so Blair Mountain joined the list, a decision that includes protections against development and other actions that might damage the listed site.\nThen the Keeper of the Register (yes, it's a real title) discovered a letter from a law firm representing a passel of coal operators who own portions of the mountain, and who were decidedly against listing it as a historical site because they have plans to strip-mine it. With a \"my bad,\" the Keeper of the Register then delisted Blair Mountain only a week after it was added, likely a record short tenure on the list.\nLabor activists, preservationists and the Sierra Club, which backs the protection as a means of keeping the mountain from being strip-mined, sued the government, arguing that the removal of the designation was arbitrary and capricious. A district court judge tossed the suit two years ago, ruling that the plaintiffs didn't have standing to file the challenge because they could not demonstrate that they had standing \u2014 they couldn't prove they would be damaged by the action.\nLast week in a 2-1 vote, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the judge's dismissal, deciding that the plaintiffs did have standing, in part because removing the surface of Blair Mountain would create a landscape where widely appreciated beauty now exists.\nIn dissent, the lone \"no\" vote questioned whether anyone has a legal right to enjoy the view of another's property, despite a litany of prior cases the majority cited. \"None of these cases would lead me to suppose that my neighbor has a legally protected right that I have invaded when I trim the grass and behead the clovers, which he enjoys viewing,\" wrote Judge David B. Sentelle.\nIt's an interesting legal case, but it's also an interesting \u2014 and ironic \u2014 look at how we value history and historic sites. With Blair Mountain, the same forces \u2014 labor and coal operators \u2014 are fighting over the same territory as in 1921, though now with lawyers instead of guns. But it also spotlights the relative lack of public memorials to labor history.\nYou can visit just about any long-operating city in this country and find a local monument to the rich capitalist who built the mansion during year whatever. But you have to look far and wide to find memorials to the people whose labor created those riches, to those who died in the battles for such modern-"}

The researchers behind the study, from Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sud R\u00e9union in France, reveal the optimal weight gain for women that would give them a balanced risk of having a very small or very large baby. The team has developed an online calculator that can advise women on their ideal weight gain for the safest birth outcome, based on the research.\nAccording to the researchers, women want to know what their optimal weight gain should be to have their baby as safely as possible, and their maternity care providers want to know what advice they can give women throughout their pregnancy. While the results show the recommendations are fine for women in the normal weight range, we have shown they are not ideal for very underweight and very overweight women.\nAs per the researchers, there is a strong link between the weight of mother and baby: very underweight mothers tend to have smaller babies, called small for gestational age (SGA) babies - and morbidly obese mothers tend to have more large for gestational age (LGA) babies. These babies are at higher risk of conditions like heart attacks, hypertension, obesity and diabetes as adults than babies born at normal weight.\nThe team of researchers carried out a 16.5 year observational study. They recorded the pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain, and weight of the baby of 52,092 women who gave birth at full term. The first finding was that only women with a normal BMI had a balanced risk of having an SGA or LGA baby (both 10 percent risk); they call this crossing point the Maternal Fetal Corpulence Symbiosis (MFCS).\nAs per the study, a woman with a BMI of 17 should gain about 22 kilograms instead of the recommended 12.5-18 kilograms. An obese woman with a BMI of 32 should gain 3.6 kilograms instead of the recommended five to nine kilograms. And very obese women with a BMI of 40 should actually lose six kilograms.\nYour dietary choices may also affect your weight. Here are some foods that may help speed up weight loss.\nSalads are one of the most obvious low-calorie items. Include more greens and veggies with high water content that make it calorically low. Make sure you add optimal amount of seasonings.\nApples contain pectin, which is a substance that helps you keep fuller for longer. Apples take a while to eat, and end up tricking your brain into believing that your stomach is full. Toss them in your salads, yogurt or oatmeal.\nOatmeal absorbs a lot of water, and is loaded with fibre, both of which make it an excellent food to stave off those hunger pangs, while using quite a few calories to do so.\nEggs have low calories to offer; therefore you can load up on eggs for some generous amount of protein that keeps your tummy fuller for long. Do not add butter or oil, which will only make the calorie count go up dramatically."}

But now, a leader who has so often seemed invincible faces grave legal and electoral peril.\nWith crucial parliamentary elections set for Tuesday, the smooth-talking, American-educated prime minister faces a vote that is widely seen as a referendum on him making controversial moves. On Saturday he pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base.\nIf the election keeps him in power, Netanyahu, 69, will hit a political milestone later this year, becoming Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, a distinction held until now by founding father David Ben Gurion. But with a criminal indictment on corruption charges hanging over his head, that historic marker might carry a very large asterisk.\nA polarizing, paradoxical figure, Netanyahu is the sort of politician who\u2019s sometimes down but never out \u2014 at least not for long. He\u2019s a onetime elite commando in a state whose military might is still central to its identity. He\u2019s admired by many as a canny political operative, but unreservedly trusted by few.\nHe has long been willing to form alliances across the political spectrum to maintain power. That fluidity \u2014 considered raw opportunism by some \u2014 is once again at play in Tuesday\u2019s elections, analysts say.\nOn Thursday, five days before facing voters, the Israeli leader was on what amounted to a campaign stop \u2014 in Moscow, where he thanked Putin personally for Russian troops\u2019 assistance with the repatriation of the remains of an Israeli soldier, Zachary Baumel, killed almost 37 years ago in the first of Israel\u2019s two wars with Lebanon. Such homecomings of remains are rare, and tend to resonate very strongly with the Israeli public.\nIt was in some ways a rerun of last month, when Netanyahu, reprising a familiar role, played the grateful beneficiary of a political gift from President Trump \u2014 this time, the White House declaring that the United States would reverse decades of policy and recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau seized from Syria in 1967.\nAlthough Netanyahu\u2019s rightist Likud party has long been the country\u2019s dominant political force, its main rival \u2014 the new centrist Blue and White party, spearheaded by former military chief Benny Gantz \u2014 has also been polling strongly throughout the campaign.\nThe final preelection polls, released Friday, showed Blue and White with a slight lead over Likud, but also suggested that a bloc of right-wing parties would be better positioned than the centrists to form Israel\u2019s next government.\nCamil Fuchs, the veteran pollster for the Haaretz newspaper, said this was the most difficult election to predict since 1996, when Netanyahu first came to power.\nHe served for three years, then returned to office in the spring of 2009 and has held the job ever since, surviving four elections.\nIsraeli politics are rarely a pretty sight, but this campaign has been distinctive for its divisive tone. In the final days before the vote, a Likud video highlighted a shaky interview performance by Gantz, sarcastically captioning wild-eyed shots of him as \u201ccompletely stable.\u201d That was reminiscent of an election-day video in 2015, when Netanyahu warned of Israeli Arab voters turning out \u201cin droves\u201d to support his rivals"}

Overall, there are a few things investors will want to keep an eye on when reviewing that report.\nVolume growth at the natural gas liquids segment, due to growing Permian Basin NGL volumes and the acquisition of the West Texas LPG pipeline system, fueled strong year-over-year net operating income growth. This helped offset weakness in its natural gas gathering and processing segment, which has been affected by direct exposure to commodity prices.\nInvestors will want to check out the natural gas gathering and processing segment first in the fourth quarter. After a weak showing last quarter, they will want to see some improvement as the company continues to restructure many of its percent-of-proceeds contracts to fee-based ones. The goal is to increase that segment's fee-based margin from 50% up to more than 70% in 2016. Its ability to restructure these contracts as well as grow its volumes will help it mute the impact from weak commodity prices.\nOne other thing to watch here is the Lonesome Creek processing plant, which was expected to be complete in November. That project, which was to cost between $550 million to $680 million, is one of its larger undertakings so it will be important to see that it was completed on time and that it started to deliver during the quarter.\nAre there any changes to guidance?\nBack in December, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners announced their financial guidance for 2016. ONEOK guided for cash available for dividends of $675 million and a dividend coverage ratio of 1.3 times. Meanwhile, ONEOK Partners' guidance was for distributable cash flow of $1.39 billion and a coverage ratio of around 1.0 times, meaning it was forecasting to pay out every penny it earned.\nThat guidance, however, was based on oil prices rising to $40 to $45 per barrel in 2016, which is a long way from the current $30 oil price. Because of that, investors should see if there are any changes to that guidance, particularly relating to the distribution. One other thing to focus on are comments made by ONEOK CEO Terry Spencer, who in the guidance press release said, \"If needed, ONEOK continues to be well positioned to provide financial support to ONEOK Partners.\" It's possible that ONEOK could take a pay cut and receive a smaller amount in distributions than it's due in order to support its MLP through the downturn so that it doesn't have to reduce its distribution to outside investors. Given ONEOK's strong projected dividend coverage ratio of 1.3 times, it could stand to take a cut and still maintain its current payout rate.\nThere is a lot of nervousness in the energy sector right now because oil and gas prices remain much weaker than had been expected. That's cutting into not only the profitability of producers but also midstream companies like ONEOK Partners that have some direct exposure to those prices. Its ability to mute that exposure by converting more of its contract to fee-based, as well as bringing more fee-based assets on line, are vitally important to its ability to sustain its current distribution through the downturn."}

Jeff Flake caused political waves Friday when he helped pave the way for an FBI investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\nNow the Arizona Republican is scheduled to ride that newfound name recognition into New Hampshire during a visit that is sparking further speculation that President Trump could very well face a primary challenge as he runs for re-election in 2020.\nIt will be the second visit by the outspoken critic of Trump to the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.\nAnother vocal GOP critic of the president, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, will also be paying his second visit to New Hampshire this year when he returns days after November\u2019s midterm election.\nThe upcoming high-profile stops in the Granite State by Flake and Kasich are further signals that Trump may be seen as vulnerable in a Republican primary.\nIf the president faces competition from within the GOP, New Hampshire will likely be ground zero.\n\u201cIf a primary comes, a credible one, it will happen here in New Hampshire. And it will do better than people expect,\u201d longtime Granite State-based consultant Jim Merrill said.\n\u201cNot only does the size of the state make it easy to work in, the media market makes it easy to work in,\u201d explained Merrill, a veteran of the 2004 President George W. Bush re-election campaign, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, and Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 White House bid.\nHe also pointed to New Hampshire\u2019s open-style primary that allows independents to vote in either Republican or Democratic contests.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s had his struggle with independent voters, so a Republican candidate looking to make inroads would do well to look at New Hampshire,\u201d Merrill said.\nBoth Ronald Reagan \u2013 in his 1976 challenge against President Gerald Ford \u2013 and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan \u2013 who took on President George H.W. Bush in 1992 \u2013 gave the incumbents major scares in the GOP primary in New Hampshire.\nFlake speaks Monday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on the campus of St. Anselm College. It\u2019s the same venue he visited in April.\nA poll by the Republican-leaning New Hampshire Journal released in August indicated that 40 percent of GOP voters in the state would welcome a primary challenge against the president, with 47 percent saying it would be a bad idea and 13 percent unsure.\nOne factor in determining whether the president faces a credible primary challenge will be November\u2019s midterm elections, where the GOP\u2019s hoping to hang onto its majorities in both houses of Congress.\nTrump easily won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, launching him toward the Republican presidential nomination and eventually the White House. He finished 19 percentage points ahead of Kasich, who came in second. But Trump took down a divided opposition, thanks to a large field of candidates.\nMerrill predicted that it could be different the second time around.\n\u201cInstead of having 17 candidates splitting the vote, you may just have two or three. That means more attention, more ability to earn support and get your message out. So that would be significant,\u201d he explained."}

The Fed has signalled it will lift rates again next month, with a December move also widely expected. The policy has attracted the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a recent interview that he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with the Fed\u2019s tightening.\nUS stocks rose and the dollar slipped as investors digested Mr Powell\u2019s first speech as Fed chief at Jackson Hole. Yields on the 10-year treasury note were initially lifted before settling back to levels prior to his remarks.\nMr Powell\u2019s speech discussed at length the challenges of monetary policy at a time when economic benchmarks \u2013 such as estimates of full employment or the neutral policy rate \u2013 are uncertain.\nThe two risks faced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are moving too fast and shortening the expansion, or moving too slowly and allowing for overheating and financial excesses, he said.\n\u201cI see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC\u2019s approach to taking seriously both of these risks,\u201d Mr Powell said. While unemployment is below the committee\u2019s longer-run estimate of a rate that corresponds with non-inflationary use of labour resources, \u201cthere does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating\u201d.\n\u201cThis is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalisation process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually,\u201d Mr Powell said.\nInvestors are pricing in another quarter-point increase from the central bank at their meeting next month. That would raise the target range for the benchmark lending rate to 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent. Odds of a second hike before year-end in December were little changed around 64 per cent.\nThere is scant evidence that the Fed\u2019s removal of stimulus is hurting growth. Unemployment is low at 3.9 per cent, and inflation, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred benchmark, is slightly above officials\u2019 2 per cent target.\nTo emphasise the Fed\u2019s attention to inflation, Powell borrowed a line that European Central Bank president Mario Draghi used in July, 2012 to preserve the euro.\n\u201cI am confident that the FOMC would resolutely \u2018do whatever it takes\u2019 should inflation expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten,\u201d Mr Powell said in his speech.\nMr Powell, who Mr Trump nominated for the job, is continuing an economic experiment that began under his predecessor Janet Yellen betting that the inflation response from a tight labour market would be muted.\nSo far, it has been. Various measures of wage growth are rising at annual rates of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent and that hasn\u2019t translated into a sharp increase in prices yet.\nThe tight labour market has produced lots of benefits, which Powell has hailed in previous remarks, saying there\u2019s a \u201clot to like\u201d about low unemployment.\n\u201cOver time, inflation has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilisation,\u201d Mr Powell said.\nThe Fed chairman discussed risk-management strategy at a time when the economy\u2019s structure is changing and uncertain.\n\u201cThe FOMC has been navigating between the shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be shifting navigational guides,\u201d he said"}

They\u2019re super low in calories and packed with fiber, vitamin C, potassium and several other nutrients. Cherry tomatoes aren\u2019t just a salad topper -- they fit easily into many of your favorite recipes.\nCherry tomatoes are loaded with insoluble fiber, the type of fiber that sweeps out your gut and helps you have regular bowel movements. Insoluble fiber has been known to relieve bouts of constipation as well. Ideally, you should be getting 14 grams of fiber in your diet for every 1,000 calories, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. So if a 2,000-calorie per-day diet is normal for you, you\u2019ll need 28 grams of total fiber. One cup of cherry tomatoes, weighing about 150 grams, provides 1.8 grams of total fiber, roughly 90 percent of which is insoluble.\nCherry tomatoes are one of the richest sources of vitamin C. You need vitamin C to keep your immune system in tip-top shape, but it also works as an antioxidant. Vitamin C, along with other antioxidants, neutralizes damaging free radicals that destroy healthy cells. When you have an abundance of free radicals lurking around in your body, oxidative stress goes up, increasing your chance of developing chronic disease. In order to keep your body as healthy as possible, women need 75 milligrams of daily vitamin C and men need 90 milligrams per day, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements. If you smoke, you\u2019ll need another 35 milligrams above your recommendation, as smoking causes free radicals to form in your system. A 1-cup serving of cherry tomatoes has around 20.5 milligrams of vitamin C.\nYou may not think of cherry tomatoes as helpful to your heart; however, they\u2019ll add some potassium to your diet, which is an electrolyte mineral that keeps electricity flowing throughout your body. That steady stream of electricity keeps your heart beating at a regular pace. Not enough potassium in your daily diet can lead to cardiac arrhythmia, more commonly known as an abnormal heartbeat. You need 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day, reports the Linus Pauling Institute. You\u2019ll easily get more than 350 milligrams just by enjoying a cup of cherry tomatoes.\nCherry tomatoes have fewer than 30 calories per cup, so you won\u2019t have to worry about ruining your waistline. Slide them onto skewers, drizzle with a touch of olive oil and place them on the top shelf of the grill while you have chicken breasts cooking below. They\u2019re perfectly enjoyable as a side dish on their own after grilling, or you can mix them in with saut\u00e9ed spinach or toss them into a fresh salad. If you\u2019re looking for a quick snack, spread a spoonful of nonfat cream cheese on a few wheat crackers, add a fresh basil leaf, cut the cherry tomatoes in half and place them on top. Cherry tomatoes are also perfect for omelets, bruschetta, pasta dishes and as a pizza topper. You can simply dip them in hummus, or enjoy them all on their own.\n"}

Dating as far back as the fifth century b.c., Brindisi was already considered an important port, a safe haven and a gateway to the world. Today the United Nations benefits of this ideal location and infrastructure in support of peacekeeping.\nThe original storage facility for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) was the United Nations Supply Depot (UNSD) first located in Naples and later moved to Pisa, Italy. The supply depot was first established to receive assets available upon the closure of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF 1) in 1956. During the 1980s and in the early 1990s, the end of the Cold War brought about an immense increase in UN Peacekeeping activity worldwide. UNSD, consisting of 3,200m2, had become too small to receive the quantities of usable surplus equipment that had become available upon the closure of several missions. In recognizing the limitations of UNSD and the need for a well-supported location in which to store and maintain reserves, DPKO sought to avail itself of a more strategically located facility. The Republic of Italy\u2019s experience with Peacekeeping and the need to ensure adequate logistical support to the missions guided the United Nations to Brindisi, Italy.\nIn 1994, UNLB was established by the United Nations to meet the logistics needs of an ever growing number of Peacekeeping Missions. Memorandum of Understanding regarding the use by the UN of military premises was signed with the Government of Italy on 23 November 1994.\nThe location within an Italian Air Force base and the support of the Italian government were critical for our success from the very beginning. Since the year 2000, UN Humanitarian agencies have also operated a Response Depot on the base.\na. Logistics support: strategic deployment stocks (SDS), material, technical and procurement support.\nFrom 1994, UNLB received refurbished and forwarded hundreds of shipments of used mission materiel. This activity saved and continues to save the Organization hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.\nIn 1998 , the General Assembly approved small Start-up kits of new materiel to support the start-up of new missions.\nIn 2002 the General Assembly approved the establishment of the Strategic Deployment Stocks. This revolving inventory provided 150 million dollars of equipment to be purchased, received, maintained, shipped and replenished at UNLB (thousand vehicles, hundreds of generators and up to three thousand containers of material).\nTo date, over 265 million dollars worth of SDS has been sent to missions. We are now preparing several shiploads and cargo flights to Darfur and Chad. In UNLB we add value to the SDS items the moment they arrive. Each item is inspected, labeled, inventoried, tested and when necessary adapted to field conditions; we receive items and we deliver systems. We are often called to accompany the SDS as Technical Support Teams during the early stages of a mission. We offer solutions and we provide continuous support.\nLogistical activities have diversified beyond Strategic Deployment stocks.

{"idx": "23334", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Suriname Special Forces. Photo by Sanoesie101, Wikipedia Commons.\nLocation of Suriname. Source: CIA World Factbook.\nIn 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government despite intense resistance from a badly outgunned police force, which was only subdued when the navy shelled them into submission. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (though there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, headed by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lt. Colonel) Desi Delano Bouterse. In December 1982, following a counter-coup attempt earlier in March, 16 prominent Surinamese soldiers, lawyers, academics, businessmen and trade-unionists were murdered allegedly at the behest of Bouterse and his henchmen. As one of the victims was also a Dutch national, all assistance programmes were suspended by the Dutch Government. The trial of the perpetrators of this crime has since been a subject of much controversy in Suriname.\nFurthermore, thanks to the continuing efforts of Chandrikapersad Santokhi, earlier in his capacity as commissioner of police and thereafter minister of justice and police, and later as the leader of the opposition, Bouterse was finally prosecuted and put on trial for his involvement in the December 1982 murders \u2013 leading to Bouterse dubbing Santokhi as the \u2018sheriff\u2019.5 This led to Bouterse Government extending amnesty in 2012 to all those who were accused of involvement in the 1982 murders including President Bouterse himself. The amnesty is being challenged in Suriname\u2019s courts and the legal arguments and machinations surrounding the trial continue to be debated to this day, with no sign of closure for the families of the victims.\nHowever, rhetoric has not been matched with budgetary allocations. Suriname currently spends about 0.6 to 0.7 per cent of its GDP on defence.11 At a time when its commodity dependent economy is experiencing negative growth rate of two per cent per annum, funding will inevitably be in short supply.12 While defence expenditure may have been high during the period of military dictatorship (reliable figures being unavailable), but that has not been the case 2008 onward. Bouterse has since shown no inclination to increase defence spending.\nThe Dutch assistance has gone to the Suriname police rather than the national army, and the American assistance has been largely in the form of intelligence cooperation with some minor support in the form of small arms and vehicles. In neither case has the assistance been very high. The US security assistance amounted to $422,236 in 2012, 97.3 per cent of which was for general military assistance and remaining three per cent for narcotics control programmes.13 What is of interest is the US effort to train the officer corps of the national army on military\u2019s role in a civilian democracy. It might be suggested that the legacy of the 1980 Bouterse coup still looms large in the consciousness of Suriname\u2019s partners.\nThe Nationaal Leger (NL) or the National Army consists of all the three formations and all use army ranks. The naval unit (or Marine) of the NL, which was reconstituted as the Coast Guard, now reports to the ministry of internal affairs though it remains under military control.

On Indiegogo, the crew made 189 percent of their target sum.\nThey\u2019ve since budgeted the feature film, which will be broken into four installments, at a total of $960,000, or $240,000 per episode. The seven-figure bankroll raises questions about just how \u201cfan\u201d the project is and at what point it poses a threat to the authorized franchise.\nThe official line from CBS and Paramount, which manage the TV and film rights to the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 franchise, respectively, is not to endorse such a production.\nPeters said he and his team met with CBS last week but the network didn\u2019t offer any specific guidelines concerning what his crew can and cannot do \u2014 the network simply told him that they can\u2019t make money off the project.\nStudios have historically been lax toward films made by fans, even benefiting from the added attention they garner for their properties.\nPrevious Kickstarter- and Indiegogo-funded fan films include \u201cStar Trek: Of Gods and Men,\u201d which generated $150,000 in donations in 2006 and \u201cStar Trek: Renegades,\u201d which drew a collective $375,000 from both platforms in 2014.\nBeyond the aforementioned characters, Peters says \u201cAxanar\u201d uses the Enterprise, assorted Klingon spaceships and the idea of the Federation and Klingons generally. However, the uniforms, other ships and prop designs are all unique.\nWhile the filmmakers of \u201cStar Trek: Axanar\u201d appear confident that they\u2019re operating in safe copyright territory, attorney Lincoln Bandlow, a partner at Fox Rothschild, LLP, insists otherwise.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s based on characters or other protectable elements of the \u2018Star Trek\u2019 work, then what they are doing is a derivative work and that\u2019s a copyright infringement that is highly unlikely to be a protected fair use,\u201d he said.\nBandlow urged Peters to tread carefully. \u201cIf you have permission from a copyright holder to do a fan-made film, there\u2019s no problem,\u201d said Bandlow. \u201cBut it\u2019s real risky to be relying on an alleged oral licensing agreement to do such a work.\nWhile \u201cAxanar\u201d may not pass the fair use test, both Peters and Bandlow agree that studios aren\u2019t likely to petition for a cease and desist in this case. \u201cStudios just say that it\u2019s not worth the fight,\u201d said Bandlow.\nSupport from fans has been overwhelming, according to Peters. Mostly because, he says, they have been under-served by recent \u201cStar Trek\u201d studio films."}

Now comes the postwar.\nIf you like postwar Iraq, you\u2019ll love the rest of Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign.\nBut the mission isn\u2019t accomplished, any more than it was in Iraq. Dean has toppled the previous front-runners, just as Bush toppled Saddam. Now the attacking is over, and the defending begins. And as Bush knows, the postwar can turn a lot uglier than the war.\nWhat does Dean need defending against? You name it. Gephardt has dredged up quotes in which Dean bashed Medicare and said he would consider raising the Social Security retirement age. So, Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, brags onstage that SEIU\u2019s endorsement gives Dean the support of the country\u2019s biggest health care union. Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, says Dean will make sure Medicare and Social Security are \u201cadequately funded.\u201d The testimonials reek of defensive language. In his speech, Stern says his members are \u201ctotally comfortable\u201d with Dean\u2019s positions on health care issues. That\u2019s like a white person saying he\u2019s \u201ctotally comfortable\u201d with the black family next door.\nThe bigger problem is that Dean\u2019s blood is bluer than his collar. The labor guys onstage know it. That\u2019s why they brought a third union, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, into this event. SEIU claims 1.6 million members. AFSCME claims 1.4 million. IUPAT claims 140,000. Numerically, that\u2019s a rounding error. But symbolically, it\u2019s important. AFSCME represents government workers, and SEIU represents service workers. Without hard hats on stage, Gephardt\u2019s buddies in the manufacturing trades could easily dismiss this event as Sissies for Dean. Hence the painters, who stand behind Dean in black T-shirts and hard hats, making clear that they\u2019re not talking about van Gogh.\nUnfortunately, Dean doesn\u2019t blend in too well. He enters the hotel in business attire, then ducks into a side room to don a green AFSCME T-shirt and purple SEIU jacket. His mistake is leaving his tie on. As he takes the stage, the knot of the tie pokes out above the collar of the T-shirt, making it look as through he\u2019s wearing a preppy green sweater under his sailing jacket. McEntee, a bruiser, hoists Dean\u2019s hand and rallies the crowd with bellowing cheers. Dean grins awkwardly, like a lawyer who has wandered into the wrong bar.\nOn its own, I don\u2019t think this class mismatch will kill Dean in a general election. But in combination with his position on Bush\u2019s tax cuts, it\u2019s fatal. McEntee says the rich made out like bandits under the tax cuts \u201cwhile the rest of us are kind of lucky to get a dime.\u201d Dean tells the crowd, \u201cSixty percent of us got $304. And you know what? You didn\u2019t even get $304,\u201d since state and property taxes went up to compensate for lost revenue. On its face, it\u2019s a losing argument: Bush gave you so little money that Dean needs to take it back. That\u2019s one postwar fight Bush can expect to win."}

{"idx": "23346", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In Wednesday\u2019s Wall Street Journal, Wharton Business School Professor Jeremy Siegel pointed out a the quirky nature by which Standard & Poors calculates earnings for the S&P 500 index. Needless to say, in this painful global economic slowdown, corporate earnings have fallen dramatically. However, S&P\u2019s recent announcement forecasting that the S&P 500\u2019s fourth quarter earnings would be negative for the first time since this data was first calculated in 1936, cast a pall over an already despondent market. Further the projection of earnings of only $40 a share for the S&P 500 for all of 2008 makes the stock market\u2019s P/E Ratio look far more pricey than one would expect at this point in a brutal bear market.\nWhat this dismal news actually reflects is the bizarre way in which S&P (and most other index providers) calculate \u201caggregate\u201d earnings and P/E ratios for their indexes. Unlike their calculation of returns, S&P adds together, dollar for dollar, the large losses of a few firms to the profits of healthy firms without any regard to the market weight of the firm in the S&P 500. If they instead weight each firm\u2019s earnings by its relative market weight, identical to how they calculate returns on the S&P 500, the earnings picture becomes far brighter.\nAs the fourth-quarter earnings season draws to a close, there are an estimated 80 companies in the S&P 500 with 2008 losses totaling about $240 billion. Under S&P\u2019s methodology, these firms are subtracting more than $27 per share from index earnings although they represent only 6.4% of weight in the index. S&P\u2019s unweighted methodology produces a dismal estimate of $39.73 for aggregate earnings last year.\nIf one applies market weights to each firm\u2019s earnings using the same procedure that S&P employs to compute returns, the results yield a more accurate view of the current profit picture. Market weights produce a reported earnings estimate of $71.10 for 2008 \u2014 nearly 80% higher than the unweighted procedure. The reason for this stark difference is that the firms with huge losses generally have extremely low market values and hence have a much smaller impact on the total earnings in the index.\nSimilarly, operating earnings (essentially, earnings before write-offs), of the S&P 500 are boosted to $81.94 per share when earnings are weighted by market value, yielding a P/E ratio of about 9.4 for the market, instead of S&P\u2019s $61.80, which yields a P/E ratio of 12.5 when firm profits are simply added. Even the negative earnings for the fourth quarter disappear when market weights are accounted for, as fourth-quarter GAAP earnings on the S&P 500 Index total $7.44 per share and operating earnings reach $14.40.\nThus, as you can see, when factoring in cap weighting to the earnings calculations, the current earnings multiple for the S&P 500 is much closer to the price-to-peak earnings ratio and is much more in line with the type of very low P/E ratio that normally accompanies the end stages of a protracted bear market."}

MacRumors says the offer ends Jan. 31 in China and Japan, but that there's been no end specified for other regions.\nIt's not great that Apple needs to do this -- it really looks like a move borne out of desperation -- but it's still probably the right course of action for the iPhone maker. Here's why.\nMany believe Apple is facing the problem that iPhone owners are simply holding on to their older devices longer than they had before. When customers aren't buying new devices as frequently -- or, put another way, as the iPhone upgrade cycle lengthens -- sales of newer models slow.\nBy allowing customers to trade in older iPhones for credit toward newer models, the company is simply making it easier for people who want new devices to go ahead and pull the trigger.\nTo be clear, those customers could very well sell their old iPhones through a number of means and then apply the proceeds to newer devices. However, there's a lot of friction in going about it that way.\nBy making it relatively easy for customers to hand over their older iPhones -- as well as some cash -- and get new devices in exchange, Apple could, to some extent, spur upgrades.\nOn top of that, by getting customers to interact directly with Apple for the entirety of the process, Apple may increase the odds that customers with older iPhones will stick with iPhone for their next purchases instead of being tempted to go with devices from the competition.\nAny business move that encourages customers to accelerate the pace at which they upgrade their devices and ensures that those users stay within its ecosystem looks like a smart one for Apple.\nBut over the long term, Apple's going to need to do better to generate interest in its latest iPhones if it wants to grow -- or even simply maintain -- iPhone shipments and revenue. All of the trade-in stuff that Apple is doing isn't something that's part of a robust long-term growth strategy. It comes off as a short-term tactical move designed to compensate for poorer-than-expected demand for its latest iPhones.\nIt's not my job to figure out what Apple needs to do in order to get iPhone unit shipments -- a figure that Apple recently decided it doesn't need to disclose to shareholders any longer -- and revenue on a sustainable growth path. That's on the decision-makers at the company.\nHowever, if Apple can't crack that puzzle within the next couple of iPhone product cycles, that doesn't seem like it'll be a good thing for Apple's overall business -- which continues to rely substantially on the performance of the iPhone -- and, ultimately, its share price."}

Portman mentioned Simpson in an interview with USA Today. \"I remember being a teenager, and there was Jessica Simpson on the cover of a magazine saying 'I'm a virgin' while wearing a bikini, and I was confused,\" Portman said. \"Like, I don't know what this is trying to tell me as a woman, as a girl.\" Simpson, who was a teen-pop sensation in the late '90s and early 2000s, was not thrilled by the shoutout and posted a statement to Portman on social media Wednesday."}

It is perhaps thicker than most modern photo frames, but with a solid stand on the back it looks and feels like a high quality device. That 7-inch screen is good and bright too, delivering the heavily O2-ised icons that make up the menus.\nA USB slot sits on the side and around the back you'll find a 3.5mm headphone jack and an Ethernet connection alongside the DC power jack.

Irritatingly it loses track of time if you do disconnect it from the mains, but it remembers your network details.

It doesn't have the same level of detail as you'd find in something like Outlook, but for home use it is probably fine.\nO2 customers get maximal benefit here, because you can have a reminder sent to your phone before an event (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week), as well being able to text your calendar to see what you are doing on particular dates and so on.\nHowever, while this is a nice simple shared calendar, there is a significant flaw at the moment. You can't import or synchronise with an existing calendar. So if you have a calendar on your phone, or in Outlook, iCal or Google Calendars, then you are out of luck. Considering that synchronising between these existing calendars is pretty simple already, it seems odd that O2 would cut themselves off.\nOther live aspects to the Joggler include the ability to view traffic information, provided by Trafficmaster, and you can scroll and zoom around the map.

It performs best when shaded from hot afternoon summer sun.\nRed and orange flowered aloe species like Aloe X spinosissima and Aloe striata and aloe hybrids provide a banquet of nectar for hummingbirds in March and April. Plant in front of a window, and you will be sure to see hummingbirds hovering and feeding on its nectar, then resting on the flower stems. It requires sun or part shade and low water.\nThis small shrubby plant comes in a number of red-flowered cultivars that are attractive to hummingbirds. Flame, Scott's Red, Furman's Red and other varieties are great for their long season of bloom both in spring and again in fall. Pruning them to keep them bushy will help increase its show of flowers.

And there's not much that can be done to speed that up.\n\"You could use a bone stimulator. But in the early area after a fracture, usually they don't have a lot of effect to speed up the healing\u2026. There's no magic bullet, unfortunately,\" said Feder, who was speaking in generalities since he has not examined Griffin.\nAccording to the Clippers, Griffin hurt his right hand when he punched assistant equipment manager Matias Testi outside a restaurant in Toronto on Saturday. X-rays taken Monday in Los Angeles found a spiral fracture of the fourth metacarpal and a day later Dr. Steve Shin performed an undefined procedure to stabilize the break and speed Griffin's recovery.\nThe forward, the Clippers' leading scorer at 23.2 points per game, has already missed a month because of a quadriceps tendon injury. He is expected to need another four to six weeks for his hand to heal.\nHowever Dr. Alidad Ghiassi, an orthopedic surgeon and hand specialist at Keck Medicine of USC, said he believes Griffin could be back sooner.\n\"The metacarpal heals very quickly,\" said Ghiassi, who, like Feder, had no firsthand knowledge of Griffin's condition.\nGhiassi said studies in Australia indicate that athletes in ballhandling sports such as basketball respond well to the type of treatment Griffin has received.\n\"If you're going to pick something, a spiral fracture, that's something good to pick,\" he said. \"Once you get into dislocations and fracture-dislocations, where the joints are dislocated, it can tougher. But a spiral fracture of the fourth metacarpal is a pretty benign condition overall.\"\nDr. Richard Ferkel, an orthopedic surgeon in Van Nuys, said Griffin may have to alter his style of play slightly -- at least in the initial days of his return.\n\"The big problem for him is not only is he out, but it's his shooting hand,\" Ferkel said. \"It's much harder to grip the ball and to develop a feel for the release of the ball off your fingertips as you're trying to recover from that injury.\"\nSlam dunks pose an even bigger danger for Griffin, who is averaging better than a dunk per game.\n\"When you slam sometimes your hand will hit the rim a little bit. You don't want to rebreak the fracture and refracture your hand,\" Ferkel said. \"Even though bones can heal in four to six weeks, that doesn't mean it's 100%.\n\"Most athletes try to get back a little quicker, so they're a little on the edge. If they just do the wrong thing it could, perhaps, get reinjured.\"\nTo combat that and to improve his grip, Griffin is almost certain to do hand-strengthening exercises as part of his rehab. After that, it's up to Mother Nature.\n\"There's actually very little that could go wrong with healing that bone,\" Feder said. \""}

Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, was reportedly set to release a bill that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing greenhouse gas regulations on Wednesday. But by 6 p.m., the bill was still nowhere to be seen\u2014so House Democrats pushed out a draft copy of the legislation to reporters themselves.\nPolitico had some details last week, noting that Upton had been working with Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) on a bill together to introduce in both the House and Senate. This is a draft of a House bill, titled the \u201cEnergy Tax Prevention Act of 2011.\u201d It would amend the Clean Air Act to make it state explicitly that it does not cover greenhouse gases, and would repeal the EPA\u2019s scientific finding that greenhouse gases are a threat to human health. It would also overrule the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that those gases can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The measure would also bar the EPA from setting new emissions standards for automobiles, and from granting states waivers that allow them set their own higher standards for cars and light trucks.\nInhofe is the most vocal skeptic of climate change in the Senate, so of course he doesn\u2019t see any reason for the EPA to regulate emissions. Upton, however, has been moderate on this issue in the past, and even endorsed the premise that emissions should be cut.\nHenry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.)\u2014authors of the cap and trade bill that the House passed in 2009 to deal with global warming\u2014sent the draft of the bill to reporters Wednesday evening, stating that they received a copy from \u201cindustry lobbyists.\u201d The two Democrats panned the draft as an \u201cassault the Clean Air Act\u201d in a release sent to reporters Wednesday night.\nThis week certainly is shaping up to be an all-out assault on the EPA. A group of Senate Democrats have introduced a bill that would delay EPA regulations for two years. And a group of Senate Republicans introduced a bill this week that would bar the EPA from acting on climate under almost every major existing environmental law."}

A recent survey from Chase Card Services found 63% of Americans have changed their spending and borrowing habits as a result of the recession.\nThe 2011 Chase Blueprint-Consumer Action Pulse of the Consumer survey found that this shift in behavior has nearly two-thirds of respondents feeling that their personal finances are in good shape. However, their outlook on the economy isn&apos;t as sunny: 60% reported they feel the economy will get worse. This pessimistic outlook is bad news for the economy, consumer sentiment drives spending, which is a vital ingredient to a recovery.\nThe survey also suggests consumers are saving more with 77% reported they are at least somewhat financially prepared for a hypothetical large expense of $1,500. In addition, 66% said they feel \u201cat least mostly in control\u201d of their financial situation.\nThe survey was conducted using a telephone poll of more than 1,000 randomly-selected adults.\nCaryn Kaiser, general manager of Chase Blueprint, said that while it was unsurprising to see that many Americans were still concerned with the current economic climate, it\u2019s a good sign that people are more confident and in control of their finances.\n\"I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d hear such a voice of confidence within personal finances,\" Kaiser said. \"The economy has pushed people to think more about where their money is going.\"\nPeople are being more cautious about budgeting. The survey found that 87% of Americans are at least putting some thought into their spending and borrowing each month. Three-quarters would also categorize their borrowing habits as \"always mindful,\" and 71% said their spending habits would also be categorized that way.\nBut will this behavior stick, once the economy is truly back on track? Kaiser said It is impossible to tell.\n\"It&apos;s always more relevant to pay attention to finances when times are tough. We certainly hope these will be lasting lessons and behaviors.\"\nThis mindfulness of finances is rubbing off beyond consumers\u2019 bank accounts. Fifty-four percent of respondents said that having a set plan for borrowing and spending--and sticking to it--helps them to maintain a good money-life balance.\nThe survey also found that 37% would spend more time managing personal finances if it were simpler.\n\"It&apos;s one of the lessons and messages (from the survey),\" Kaiser said. \"People can try not to make things so complex\u2014it doesn&apos;t have to be so hard.

We can get an impression by watching the grainy, scratchy-sounding news reels showing people plugging in a kettle or a heater or switching on a light rather than an oil lamp or candle. Scepticism gave way to ready acceptance for the most part, opening a path for what would follow \u2013 several generations worth of research and innovation that delivered products and services that would have been impossible to imagine for those suddenly able to throw a switch to get warm.\nWind the clock forward and we are at it again. History has repeated itself with rural communities once again awaiting the arrival of advanced technology, this time in the form of a dependable high-speed broadband service. Urban areas have been wired up for years but business people away from population centres struggle to participate in ecommerce. The Government regularly issues statements on how well the delivery of fibre broadband is going but this has not stopped the complaints of communities where this magic \u201cnew\u201d technology has yet to land.\nOf course there are constraints, mainly the cost of high-speed cabling \u2013 fibre \u2013 and on where the high speed connections will land next. But either we are going to provide these services or we are not. Stop telling country dwellers about how great it will be when it arrives \u2013 just deliver it.\nThe convolution of cost and geography \u2013 the longer the cable run the more it costs \u2013 was there in the 1950s and it is there for broadband, but there is one area where those living in the country might have an advantage \u2013 running your own private power station. Researchers have been looking for some time at using small windmills and solar panels to collect electricity that can be stored in batteries. These can be used to charge up the electric car and provide water and space heating with any supplementation needed coming from the existing ESB supply. Potentially, any surplus left in the battery at night could theoretically be sold back to the ESB, in the process reducing electricity costs for the home owner.\nCould this really work? Maybe. It just depends on achieving agreement from all parties, from the homeowner to the power supply company and including the Government. Much of the necessary technology is already there, but one complexity to be sorted out is so called \u201csmart metering\u201d, power metering that allows electricity to flow in either direction and makes it possible to deliver power back into the distribution grid in a form it can use.\nAcademic researchers and companies such as ESB Networks, the people who run the grid to deliver power to our front door, have been working for years on developing ways to feed renewable power back into the national grid without disrupting the overall balance of the system. This is way more difficult than it might seem on paper and has been a challenge when trying to integrate intermittent wind-power resources with the grid.\nLast week ESB Networks launched its \u201cinnovation strategy\u201d with plans to spend more on research and the development of technology to develop truly smart metering and distribution technologies that take account of the individual consumer/supplier of electricity.\nIt presented eight road maps that will focus, among other things, on connecting more renewable sources, increase power demand for transport and home heating and developing a grid that in its entirety can be considered to be \u201csmart\u201d.\nIt describes plans to undertake \u201ca whole suite of smart network research projects and trials\u201d, but this one pulled me up short.

The survey of more than 800 vets found that most feel ethical qualms \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 about what pet owners ask them to do. And that takes a toll on their mental health.\nDr. Virginia Sinnott-Stutzman is all too familiar with the results. As a senior staff veterinarian in emergency and critical care at Angell, she sees a lot of very sick animals \u2014 and quite a few decisions by owners that trouble her.\nSometimes, owners elect to have their pets put to sleep because they can't or won't pay for treatment, she says. Or the opposite, \"where we know in our heart of hearts that there is no hope to save the animal, or that the animal is suffering and the owners have a set of beliefs that make them want to keep going.\"\nDistress around choices such as those is pervasive among vets, Moses and her colleagues found. For example, 69 percent said they had felt moderate to severe distress about not being able to give animals what they thought was the right care. Almost two-thirds were bothered by inappropriate requests for euthanasia.\nThe study's senior author, Cambridge Health Alliance psychiatrist and Harvard bioethicist J. Wesley Boyd, sees a connection between the study's findings and daunting statistics about veterinarians' suicide rates: \"My assumption,\" he says, \"is that the findings from our survey are definitely part of, or even the majority of, the reason why veterinarians have higher-than-average suicide rates.\"\nAnd Moses says that while euthanizing an animal is often the right thing to do to end suffering, that doesn't make it easy.\n\"I want to make a plea to the pet-owning public to understand that, no matter what you think, odds are the person who's trying to help you take care of your animal has pretty strong feelings about how important that is,\" she says. \"And they feel it.\"\nThe study's authors are calling for better training \u2014 in veterinary school and beyond \u2014 on self-care and how to cope with moral distress and ethical conflict.\nSinnott-Stutzman defines moral distress as the feeling when the vet determines an optimal treatment course but is blocked from carrying it out \u2014 whether because of money, or an owner's beliefs, or rules about, say, dogs that bite.\n\"The most poignant example is when a young dog has a fracture \u2014 so a totally fixable, non-life-threat"}

The suspect was tied to the murder atrocity by forensic evidence that was collected at the crime scene in the forest. The hunt continues for additional suspects. The forces arresting the wanted Palestinian near a mosque were attacked by a crowd, which hurled home-made bombs, rocks and iron bars at the forces and blocked their path. Some witnesses reported gunshots at the officers. There were no casualties. The court gag order prohibiting the release of details of the investigation is still in force. The murder is known to have been carried out by a group. The investigators expect the first arrest to lead to the rest of the gang.\nThe Shin Bet and police is under extreme pressure to solve the crime with all possible speed, not only because of its gravity, but for its symbolic effect. The murder of a young Israeli woman serving in the national service program in a populated area of southern Jerusalem has the dangerous potential of inspiring Palestinian extremists to perpetrate more terrorist acts of the same kind.\nOri Ansbacher was found just three weeks after an elderly Israeli couple, Tamar and Yehuda Kadouri, were murdered by a Palestinian man at their home in another part of Jerusalem, Armon Hanatziv. The police have so far not run down the perpetrator. It was therefore doubly important to quickly solve the murder of Ori Ansbacher, who was laid to rest on Friday at Tekoa.

Extremists of \u013dSNS agreed on the raid with Kali\u0148\u00e1k or Smer head Robert Fico, according to O\u013daNO leader Igor Matovi\u010d.\n\u201cIt is because everyone knows that the stronger Kotleba is, the bigger the chance is that Smer will rule,\u201d Matovi\u010d told the press.\nLeader of SaS Richard Sul\u00edk agrees.\nIn his reaction, Kali\u0148\u00e1k stated in a similar fashion that Matovi\u010d and Sul\u00edk are preparing for cooperation with Kotleba. He pointed out that Sul\u00edk initiated a meeting with Kotleba to discuss the political strategy of Kotleba\u2019s party which happened before the 2010 elections.\nMiz\u00edk was not charged because of his political opinions but for xenophobic statements which crossed the border of what society should accept. For example, after Miz\u00edk published his comment on Kiska\u2019s awards, one of the awarded people, Michal Ka\u0161\u010d\u00e1k, the organiser of the festival Pohoda, found \u201cJude raus!\u201d written on his office wall, which means \u201cJew go away\u201d, according"}

Successfully catering to the algorithm's quirks can mean the difference between a top-ranked listing that is seen by countless travelers, and an also-ran rental that remains buried at the bottom.\nBut while some of the factors that go into rising through the rankings are common sense and fairly well known (it helps to get good reviews, for example), much of it remains a black box of which hosts can only guess. And guess they do: Airbnb hosting forums are filled with tips and tricks that are based on little more than suspicion and anecdotal evidence.\nAirbnb's Superhost badge is awarded to hosts who meet a certain checklist of criteria related to reviews (at least 80 percent need to be five stars), cancellations (you can't pull the trigger on any in the past year), volume (at least 10 guests in the past year), and response rate (you need to write back at least 90 percent of queries).\nFor Airbnb hosts, making Superhost actually feels like a really big deal. You get priority customer service as well as a nifty badge that signals to to skittish guests that they are in good hands. But one thing you don't get, according to the Airbnb blog post, is a boost in your search results. However, it should be noted that the factors that go into making Superhost status definitely do impact your search results\u2014there's just no additional boost from having the badge.\nThis is probably the biggest shocker in the blog post. Airbnb host forums are filled with advise to slightly alter your listing in some subtle way on a near-daily basis, and it's been a longstanding assumption in the host community that the Airbnb algorithm favors listings that are constantly tweaked and changed. Adding fire to this rumor: The Airbnb host dashboard tracks the last time each listing was updated, giving the impression that this matters.\nTurns out, it doesn't. According to the blog post, \"repeatedly changing or tweaking your listing will neither help nor hurt your Search Ranking.\"\nAirbnb has been pushing its Instant Book program, and rewards hosts who sign up. As the blog post put it: \"The best way to immediately improve performance in Search is to enable Instant Book. Our research shows that guests prefer the booking experience that Instant Book provides. Even when they don\u2019t filter for Instant Book listings, they often choose them over others because booking a place to stay quickly means they can get on with planning the rest of their trip.\"\nEven if a guest doesn't end up booking your place, the fact that they bothered to click through to get more info can help your standing. \"The more clicks you get from curious travelers, the higher you\u2019ll rank in search results over time.

It was an expedient move: China's economic machine was kicking into high gear, and ascension to the World Trade Organization was imminent. Both would require a legal regime that, at the very least, protected property rights and regulated commercial dealings. Since then, the legal profession has boomed in China. The country boasts an extensive network of courts and numerous official channels through which citizens can seek redress for grievances against the government. At the same time, however, corruption has exploded.\nAnd so it was with a sense of urgency that the Fourth Plenum of the 18th Central Committee meeting convened last week to unveil comprehensive legal reforms meant to buttress Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature anticorruption campaign. Many of the announced reforms echo those in the Five-Year Reform Plan of the Supreme People's Court that came down this past July, and pilot programs are already underway in Shanghai, Guangdong, and a few other key areas.\nThe Fourth Plenum reform outline provides for a stronger, more independent, and more professionalized judiciary. The first major change is the deeper separation of the courts from party interference, a key nexus of corruption. Judges will be chosen from the legal profession instead of the ranks of party members without any training in law. The infrastructure of the judiciary will be built out, with an additional level of circuit courts under the Supreme People\u2019s Court. Legal jurisdictions may be rearranged so as to not overlap with local jurisdictions, decreasing the influence of the latter."}

The federal government wants a dump for Australian-sourced low and intermediate-level waste at Barndioota, near the Flinders Ranges town of Hawker. The site is culturally important to local Aboriginal people, and the project has been met with bitter opposition from Traditional Owners.\nMeanwhile, the Labor state government of Premier Jay Weatherill plans a complex of dumps and re-encapsulating facilities, as part of a massive scheme that will involve importing and storing, for payment, as much as a third of the world\u2019s current stock of high-level spent reactor fuel. A related part of the project will be the world\u2019s largest dump for imported intermediate-level radioactive waste.\nBefore heading off on September 13 to inspect nuclear waste storage facilities under construction in Finland, Weatherill gave his strongest hint yet that after a period of \u201cconsultation\u201d, the state government by year\u2019s end will shift its dumps scheme into a phase of active preparation.\nWeatherill\u2019s \u201cconsultation\u201d began in 2015 with a royal commission headed by former state governor Kevin Scarce and advised by well-known pro-nuclear advocates.\nSince the commission gave the dumps scheme its go-ahead early this year, the government has campaigned to swing public opinion behind the plan. This effort includes TV ads, a big social media campaign, deliberations by a randomly-selected \u201ccitizens\u2019 jury\u201d and pro-nuclear promotions by a team, dubbed by critics the \u201cnuclear roadshow\u201d, that has travelled the state pushing the royal commission\u2019s findings.\nIn plugging its scheme, the government is having to combat a strong local anti-nuclear tradition dating back to the days of the bomb tests. But, promised a financial bonanza by the royal commission \u2014 which predicted that as many as 37 client countries would pledge millions to help build a dump complex in SA \u2014 many of the state\u2019s residents initially took the bait. In a poll for the Advertiser in February, 48% of respondents backed the proposal, with 39% against and 13% uncommitted.\nThen a long series of sobering facts started to emerge. A study by The Australia Institute noted that to perform its economic modelling, the royal commission had engaged an engineering firm, Jacobs MCM, which is a large-scale contractor to the world nuclear industry.\nBuilt into the figures Jacobs provided, the Australia Institute explained, were numerous assumptions, mostly speculative and often decidedly unrealistic.\nPerhaps the most outrageous of these assumptions was the suggestion that no competition would emerge for the promised \u201cbonanza\u201d \u2014 not even from countries such as China, Russia and India that have their own nuclear industries and are likely in time to build their own waste repositories and which could offer storage services to international customers far more cheaply than SA.\nNor did Jacobs consider suggestions that prospective \u201cdeep borehole\u201d technology could let potential client countries tackle their waste problems at home, for a fraction of the cost.\n\u201cA loss overall [for the SA scheme] is well within the range of possible outcomes,\u201d the Australia Institute concluded.\n"}

Who is this man looking at me in his rearview mirror \u2014 and what are his prospects in the billion-dollar ride-hailing market relative to other side jobs he could take on?\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is the government\u2019s paramount fact-finding agency on work. It claims that \u201ccontingent workers\u201d comprise about 10% of the workforce as of 2018. But consultants and labor groups \u2014 from McKinsey & Co. to the Freelancers Union to Upwork \u2014 say contingent workers make up 30% to 40% of the workforce. Even those who actively study this work phenomenon can\u2019t agree on its character or scope.\nCome April, I think hard about the data that the bureau collects and circulates to assist job-seekers, guide public policy and inform private industry and financial markets. Just last year the bureau released its first Contingent Worker Survey in 13 years. It\u2019s also trying to incorporate better tax and Social Security data to bring into focus a more accurate picture of how this country works.\nWhat the Bureau of Labor Statistics can tell me right now is that the occupations with the highest concentration of unincorporated, self-employed workers are sales, agriculture or \u201ccreativity.\u201d The \u201ccreativity\u201d job fields are dated nearly to the point of meaninglessness.

Had the boy got Gareth's ankle he could have been out for six months and you end up with the player unable to enhance his reputation.\"\nBale is proving something of a nemesis for Norwich after scoring his fourth goal in three games against them at Carrow Road following two last season in the Premier League and one earlier this season in the League Cup.\nEven Canaries boss Chris Hughton, who remains a firm favourite with fans at Spurs, where he played and coached, could not contain his own appreciation of the quality.\n\"We could have stopped at source,\" said Hughton. \"But sometimes you have to put your hands up and say it was a great goal by a top-class player.\"\nBut he disagreed with Villas-Boas's complaint and said: \"The way Bale went past him, I did not see too much wrong with it. Alex didn't get a piece of him, in fact no one did.\" Hughton was delighted with the point, Wes Hoolahan having scored the opener after finishing a move involving Robert Snodgrass, Grant Holt and Anthony Pilkington in the 32nd minute.\nHughton said: \"The performance was a lot better but we are disappointed to give that lead away.\n\"We needed a top-class save from Mark Bunn and I felt we were going to hold out but that was some equaliser.\" Bunn, in for the injured John Ruddy made outstanding saves from Jermain Defoe and Spurs new boy Lewis Holtby, their signing from Schalke who came on as a substitute.\nAfter suffering varying degrees of ignominy at the weekend in the FA Cup, both teams needed a positive response.\nSadly, Grant Holt showed neither finesse in finishing, when put clear by Robert Snodgrass, nor class in his crossing, when trying to pick out Wes Hoolahan in the early exchanges.

The 49ers finished strong last year, winning their final two games against the Lions and Rams to get to the .500 mark. As a result, many experts suspect this year will be their breakout year \u2014 the year they finally become the kind of team Singletary wants and the year they return to the playoffs.\nSingletary wanted the 49ers to be a physical team that could run the ball well to control the game. His vision is for them to be the type of physical team that can control the line of scrimmage with the running game and blend in the play action pass for the big play. But last year, the 49ers could not run the ball on first down \u2014 or any down for that matter \u2014 and once they got behind in the down-and-distance count, they struggled to be productive on offense. The Niners struggled to overcome any negative plays during a drive \u2014 they ranked second in the NFL in allowing sacks on first down, surrendering 18, and led the league in three-and-outs. So when an opposing defense was able to get the 49ers in second or long, or any third and long, a punt was the next play. Third down \u2014 especially third and long \u2014 was the 49ers\u2019 offensive nemesis: They were below 30 percent converting all third downs but 17 percent on third and 10 or more, ranking slightly ahead of the Bills for 31st in the NFL. Ouch. Before you think the 49ers can win the West, you better hope they can become more effective making plays in the passing game.\nThe disconnect for me when talking about the 49ers centers on the philosophy. Can you really be a great running team in the NFL and make a deep run in the playoffs? Yes, I know the Jets did it last year, but they were helped down the stretch (remember Indy lying down?), and even the Jets know they must throw the ball effectively to improve. The Chargers and 49ers were the two worst running teams on first down in the league, but because the Chargers could throw the ball \u2014 down the field \u2014 they finished fourth in points scored.\nEven if Singletary is able to get the 49ers to become a better running team, will this make them a playoff team? The 49ers must become a better passing team, they must be able to handle the blitz better and they must make plays down the field if they\u2019re going to make a playoff appearance. For all the talk about the 49ers becoming more of a Mike Singletary type of team this year, they might want to spend more time working on a third down package, on their passing game and on their ability to overcome negative plays.\nThe 49ers are tough, they are physical, they are a Mike Singletary type of team \u2014 but Mike must modify his philosophy to fit into today\u2019s game and pass the torch to his quarterback. I have been very critical of 49ers quarterback Alex Smith, but with a better team around him and another year in the same system, this can be his year \u2014 at least a make-or-break year. By the end of next season, the 49ers will know if they have their franchise quarterback or if they regret not making the move for former Eagle Donovan Mc"}

This is then followed by \u00a310,000 in pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support, and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider UK startup scene.\nIt is this \u201cpre-team, pre-idea\u201d approach that sets EF apart from other accelerators \u2014 and something that initially left the rather conservative European VC industry grossly underestimating its potential \u2014 while the emphasis on technical talent is producing some very interesting results.\nNot least, EF\u2019s biggest (albeit only significant) exit to date: Magic Pony, sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and creating a huge return for EF itself and the 1-year-old startup\u2019s other early investors.\nEF has also raised two funds of its own, having just announced its \u00a340 million \u201cNext Stage Fund\u201d to add to \u00a38.4 million raised last year.

With 28,000 iMessages sent every second, iMessages have become a popular texting option, due in large part to the success of Apple's iOS business. At the time of writing, Apple has sold over 600 million iMessage-enabled iOS devices. With OS X Mountain Lion, and its included Messages app, Apple's desktop OS gained the ability to send and receive iMessages, boosting the service's use even more.\niMessages has a number of advantages over traditional texting, in both convenience and security. When sending a message to a number of individuals simultaneously, the Messages app keeps the replies in a conversation thread, reminiscent of a chat or instant messaging program. iMessages are also synchronized across your iOS and OS X devices, helping you keep track of your conversations from desktop to mobile and back. Because iMessages are encrypted end-to-end, Apple has touted the service as a more secure alternative to traditional text messages.\niMessage is a proprietary Apple service that only works with iOS devices and Mac computers with OS X Mountain Lion or later. Because of its advanced features that go beyond basic SMS or MMS, Messages use data instead of your text message allotment, as long as you are sending exclusively to other iOS devices. If you are on Wi-Fi, or have an unlimited data plan, Messages provides unlimited texting. Even if you have a limited data plan, you can still send hundreds, or even thousands, of iMessages.\nIf you send a message to a non-Apple device, or to an iOS device with iMessage disabled, Messages reverts to sending a standard SMS or MMS message. The same applies if you send a group message to a mixture of Apple and non-Apple devices. Any replies from iOS devices will show up in the iMessage conversation thread, while replies from non-Apple devices will show up as separate text messages. Any SMS or MMS message will count as an ordinary text message and will not use data.\nIf your data plan is extremely limited, or you use a cell phone carrier that does not allow simultaneous calls and data, you may choose to completely disable iMessage via the iOS settings. If you do this, the iOS Messages app defaults to sending regular SMS and MMS messages.

A trial is expected to take place soon.\nTashi Wangchuk, 31, was detained on January 27, 2016, after appearing in a New York Times video in which he advocated for the rights of Tibetans to learn and study in their mother tongue. Although he told the paper explicitly that he was not calling for Tibetan independence, he was charged in March 2016 with \u201cinciting separatism,\u201d and faces up to 15 years in prison. In September, prosecutors sent his case for trial by a criminal court in Yushu prefecture, Qinghai, but in December, they unusually asked the court to send the case back to them for further investigation. The re-investigation concluded by January 4, 2017, and the case has now been returned to the court for trial.\nPerformers carry a giant Chinese national emblem and pictures of Chinese government leaders during a celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region, China.\nTashi Wangchuk ran a small shop in Kyegundo (also spelt Jekundo and in Chinese, Yushu), in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, selling Tibetan products such as caterpillar fungus, which he also marketed online. He began voicing concern publicly about the lack of Tibetan-language education after the authorities in Kyegundo stopped local monasteries and a private school in the area from teaching Tibetan to laypeople, according to the Times. Since 2012, public schools in Tibetan areas of Qinghai and neighboring Gansu Province, although nominally offering bilingual education in Chinese and Tibetan, had stopped using Tibetan as a medium of education and offered it only as a standalone subject, if at all.\nChina has set up a bilingual education system in minority schools, but in practice, teaching of Mandarin Chinese increasingly predominates or is exclusive. Regulations on the implementation of bilingual education in \u201cethnic minority areas,\u201d issued by China\u2019s State Council in August 2015, ordered authorities in those areas to \u201cunswervingly implement the national common language and writing education to ensure that minority students master and use the basic national common language,\u201d referring to Mandarin Chinese (putonghua). But the regulations state only that the right of ethnic minorities to receive education in their own languages be \u201crespected and guaranteed,\u201d and does not explicitly require the government to provide minority language education.\nTashi Wangchuk traveled to Beijing in May 2015 to explore filing a formal complaint against officials in his home area for failing to support Tibetan language education.

Amid mounting popular frustration, criticism of Qaboos bin Said Al Said has emerged. There are several measures the regime can undertake to avoid further unrest.\nMarc Valeri is a senior lecturer of political economy at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies (IAIS) and director of the Center for Gulf Studies at the University of Exeter. His current research focuses on the social, political, and economic transformations in the Gulf monarchies as well as nation building and political legitimacy in the Sultanate of Oman since 1970.\nThe uncertain health of the sultan of Oman has heightened concern about the future of the country, the most personalized of all Gulf monarchies. Many Omanis have long equated the country with its ruler, Qaboos bin Said Al Said, who won their loyalty by building up a state and a national identity centered on himself. However, amid mounting popular frustration, criticism of Qaboos has emerged, as has anxiety about what will follow his reign. There are several measures the regime can undertake to avoid further unrest.\nThe Omani model of political legitimacy is intimately linked to Qaboos. But the country\u2019s young population feels less indebted to the ruler, and an increasingly vocal civil society has been complaining about deep-seated flaws in the state he built after taking power in 1970.\nIn 2011 and 2012, most major towns saw peaceful protests by Omanis demanding higher salaries, better living conditions, substantial political reforms, and the end of corruption.\nThe regime responded with a combination of economic gestures, firings of some top officials, and the detention of peaceful activists. Since 2012, repressive measures have become more prominent, with new investments in the security sector and crackdowns on dissonant voices.\nPolitical parties are prohibited in Oman and, despite some cosmetic reforms, nearly all power remains with the monarch.\nWhile the protests did not initially target the sultan, criticism of Qaboos and his practices has become more common. Protesters are worried about the future of the country and are speaking out on its behalf.\nOman\u2019s leaders should recognize that the environment has changed. Young Omanis will not be willing to grant the next ruler the same degree of control that their parents granted Qaboos. Instead, Qaboos\u2019s successor is likely to face renewed demands for reform.\nLimits on civil society should be relaxed. Rather than actively harassing and repressing peaceful alternative voices, the regime should encourage civil society organizations, a step toward allowing some public participation in governance.\nAnswers to political uncertainties should be provided. The regime\u2019s reluctance to appoint a prime minister or a crown prince with some executive powers and to prepare for a post-Qaboos Oman has only fueled popular anxiety over the perceived lack of a long-term economic and political vision for the country. If the current ruler does not provide answers to these questions soon, the uncertainty could provoke considerable turmoil in the event of Qaboos\u2019s sudden demise.\nThe sultan of Oman traveled to Germany to receive medical care in July 2014. His prolonged stay since then has revived concerns across Omani society about the future of the country without the \u201cfather of the nation.\u201d1 A taped, four-minute television address in early November by Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al"}

Most importantly\u2014they assess expectations.\n\"So let me say point blank that the expectations for Panera and Buffalo Wild Wings were about as low as they could go,\" Cramer said.\nIn fact, there was chatter on the street for both companies that things had gotten worse and sales would fall short. That exactly the reason why Cramer thinks both Panera and Buffalo Wild Wings stock blew it out of the water on Wednesday.\nSimply, the expectations were so low that they had to be beat.\nCramer doesn't think either of these stocks would have shot up so high if it wasn't for Chipotle's huge run after earnings. But that's just how things work, as the big institutional money managers now know that a negative analysis on Panera and Buffalo Wild Wings will have to go positive. Cramer wouldn't be surprised if analysts upgrade both stocks on Thursday.\nThe inverse of these low expectation stocks was with the great expectations given to Tableau Software. Tableau posted 65 percent revenue growth, and topped estimates by $9 million. Yet the stock still tanked more than 10 percent on Wednesday. How the heck did that happen?\nOne word\u2014expectations. Analysts wanted to see 70 percent growth and $15 million in revenue beat, and their bullish expectations were totally deflated.\nThe concept of great versus poor expectations can also be applied to topics outside of stocks. For instance, there were poor expectations about the Fed statement on Wednesday. Many though the Fed would be tough on rates soon, but it delivered the same old song and dance. That was enough to beat the poor expectations.\nThere were also low expectations for the oil market, and when the wire story that the Saudis will cut back on oil supply at the end of the summer hit it was enough to make Cramer think crude will begin to rebound and take stocks with it.\n\"It's all about expectations, and as long as you know what the expectations are, you can understand what would otherwise be stupendously counterintuitive moves,\" Cramer said."}

Sure, you should always keep leashes on pets during Halloween, even when they\u2019re inside. But go a step beyond that.\nOf course you\u2019ll want to provide food, water and places for elimination, too. Bailey Deacon, director of communications for the Baltimore Animal Rescue & Care Shelter, says when you enter the room to visit your pet, consider ditching part of any costume you have donned, especially masks that can confuse and frighten animals.\nMost people know that sweets can be dangerous and even fatal for dogs, cats and other animals. But young kids may not recognize the hazard and slip such goodies to pets. And there are other dangers, too. Pets may eat candy wrappers, ribbons and paper. The items can get stuck inside them and make them ill or even necessitate emergency surgery. Keep candy up high and explain to kids why sharing it can sicken the pet, says Deacon.\nIdeally you\u2019ll want to do this before Halloween for several reasons including helping them acclimate.\nOne vital element is to teach the pet that seclusion does not equal punishment. Bank rewards her dogs with treats and soft music whenever they willingly go into their crates.\nAnother safety precaution: Keep the outdoor pets inside for at least a few days after the holiday, too, just to avoid any post-holiday harm, says Levy.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with putting a costume on your dog or pet if the animal is comfortable. But take care when selecting one, reminds Deacon. Pets must be able to easily see, breathe and walk in a costume, says Deacon. If they can\u2019t, they can get hurt or might bite or scratch others. It\u2019s a good idea to make sure the costumes doesn\u2019t have buttons, bells, pins or other small items a pet can chew and swallow.\n\u201cWe suggest a fun Halloween bandanna for pets that don\u2019t enjoy wearing costumes,\u201d says Deacon. Bank added a button that read \u201cThat\u2019s Hot\u201d to her dog\u2019s lead a few years ago and said it was a Paris Hilton costume.\nAnother safety precaution: Don\u2019t wait until the big day to try the costume on your pet. If you rush to put it on before guests arrive, you add an extra layer of stress to the animal. That can also cause your pet to bite, scratch or otherwise act out.\nSome pet owners know their dogs and other animals are social enough to join them as they accompany trick-or-treaters. It\u2019s still a good idea to keep a close eye and hand on your dog, no matter how social, says Deacon.\n\u201cKeep in mind that lots of small children may approach and pet your dog,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile we hope their parents have taught them to ask first, with all the excitement of the holiday they may forget.\u201d Fear and panic can cause dogs and cats to act out so watch them closely.\nThat sounds like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s easy to lose track of your pet\u2019s exact whereabouts"}

They\u2019re where you meet new customers and potential partners, foster existing relationships, and raise brand awareness. However, events can be a huge drain on your financial and company resources, and it\u2019s not always easy to decide which events you should focus your efforts on. So here are some guidelines to help startups with limited budgets determine when to attend, skip, or sponsor an event.\nPrior to deciding if your startup should participate in an event, it\u2019s important to create a list of goals. You can use these goals to reduce the number of events you consider and ensure a targeted approach to achieve a higher ROI.\nAt my company, our goal is seeing high engagement with our specific decision makers \u2014 not just general \u201cconsumer awareness.\u201d Because of that, we stay focused and attend events that have relevant attendees and topics that can help a brand get recognition in their niche industry. Not only will potential clients have better knowledge of the respective industry, but they\u2019ll also attain a deeper understanding of who the brand really is.\nThe higher number of brands in attendance, the harder it is to break through the noise. Events like SXSW and Cannes, for example, are extremely popular. They\u2019re generally interesting and have a good lineup of talks, presentations, and side events, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right for the brand you\u2019re building. The level of investment required to participate and do something meaningful at mainstream events like these is incredibly high, and much of the audience you\u2019re paying to reach isn\u2019t even necessarily your target audience.\nSome brands spend more than half of their total budget on branding activations, which means you\u2019ll be going up against other brands (many of whom aren\u2019t even actual competitors in your space) that are happy to put excessive resources towards bigger events. Trying to compete with the noise and saturation from these bigger brands ultimately diminishes the return on every dollar you spend at these events.\nAdditionally, when you define your goals, you can optimize your work spent on events. Instead of going to hundreds of events in a year, you can go to 10 great and impactful ones that map back to your goals. The fewer events a brand attends, the more budget is available to be used toward more unique sponsorship opportunities that stand out.\nYou also need to consider what your staffing situation would look like at an event. At startups, people are busy with their own job responsibilities outside of working events. You likely don\u2019t have a lot of people available for traveling to several events throughout the year, whereas bigger companies have a whole team of at least 15 dedicated to it. Sending staff to events also means taking them away from the office, which may not be so easy when you\u2019re in the early days of building a company.\nAfter you\u2019ve narrowed down the list of potential conferences, take a closer look and evaluate the level of impact each one can have. This includes taking a look at the approach of the event and its location and then mapping it back to your business goals and growth opportunity.\nFor starters, take a closer look at the conference programming. It\u2019s worth attending if the conference has a unique approach that\u2019s different from other events you\u2019ve attended in the past. That may mean more or fewer panels, fireside chats, or breakout sessions. Clich\u00e9s in panel topics (and in participants) are rampant in most verticals. Unique and thoughtful panel topics are interesting in their own right, but they are also indicative of the overall quality of a show.\nNext, consider who\u2019s attending.

Would it not be ironic for the Legislature to approve that proposal while allowing continued use of a chemical proven to do the exact opposite?\nI\u2019ve been working on reducing toxic chemicals that damage the health of our communities for 30 years since we passed the Toxics Use Reduction Act in Massachusetts.

And it still works. When the maker of Raid, S. C. Johnson and Son was confronted with the scientific evidence about the brain damaging impact of chlorpyrifos, they simply removed it. Are the pesticide companies telling us they can\u2019t?\nWhat they say instead is that they\u2019ll be careful. A ban isn\u2019t necessary.

Tom has a $200,000 insurance policy through his employer and a $150,000 individual policy. Jane, who lost her policy by leaving her job, plans to purchase a term policy with a death benefit of approximately $150,000.\nThe dark days Jane mentions involved \u201cviatical\u201d settlements, where companies purchased the \u201cactive\u201d life insurance policies of individuals suffering from AIDS or other presumed terminal illnesses and paid an oftimes vastly reduced sum in exchange for \u201cowning\u201d the death benefit. The sad heyday of that era occurred in the 1980s and although unscrupulous practices have been largely eradicated through consumer-protective legislation, Jane\u2019s concerns are valid. Anytime that a financial instrument allows for abuse or fraud, it could happen.\nThe accelerated death benefit, in principle, is similar to the viatical settlement in that it allows for tapping a death benefit before the fact. However, the accelerated death benefit is different because today that \u201cright\u201d is a policy rider. That means that an insured individual purchases the option, on buying a policy, to \u201cdraw down\u201d the death benefit in advance to pay for medical care costs or long-term health care expenses associated with a chronic or catastrophic illness. In short, it\u2019s a policy feature that can be added on, for a specific amount and it\u2019s not inexpensive. It can run from 10 to 20 percent of the premium depending on the percentage of death benefit that can be drawn down.\nThere\u2019s much buzz about the accelerated death benefit now because some people are eyeing it as a more cost-effective alternative to long-term care insurance. The thinking is that people don\u2019t really know whether they\u2019ll need long-term care or whether they\u2019ll actually meet the criteria for the benefits, regardless of how much they\u2019ve paid in premiums. So being able to tap cash for medical expenses sounds more expeditious.\ndiagnosis of a chronic, terminal or specific illness in which death is likely within a certain time period (for terminal illness within a time period there may be no extra charge) diagnosis of a catastrophic illness for which extraordinary (and expensive) medical treatment will be required permanent placement in a nursing home.\nIn most cases, the policy rider must be \u201cactivated\u201d by a serious disease, such as a life-threatening cancer, a heart attack, a stroke or kidney failure. Consumers should understand that such coverage is generally not available for AIDS, paraplegia or conditions requiring organ transplant.\nIn other words, the benefit is not the same as a long-term care policy, and knowing what is not covered is extremely important.

The results were presented this week at a major conference in the United States.\nAssociate Professor Jimmy So, chief of surgical oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), said that patients with advanced gastric cancer usually survive three to 10 months, when given conventional treatment.\nBut of the 22 patients in the phase 2 clinical trial at NCIS, 16 survived beyond a year, with half living for more than 18 months.\nIn six of the patients, the cancer had shrunk to the point where surgery to remove the tumour was possible. They had a median survival of 22 months. The patients also enjoyed a relatively good quality of life.\nProf So presented the mid-term results of the trial at the meeting in San Diego, called Catch the Next Wave in Science and Medicine, on Sunday.\nThe survival period went up on account of an additional step involved in the treatment.\nOn top of the conventional chemotherapy and anti-cancer medication, this step involves inserting a liquid chemotherapy drug into the abdomen for about an hour, and then draining it off. The procedure kills off cancer cells in the peritoneum, or abdominal cavity.\nProf So said that this is the most common site for a relapse, accounting for about 40 per cent of the resurgence of gastric cancer cases.\nHe told The Straits Times: \"Relapse in the peritoneum is very difficult to treat. It is very bad news.\"\nIn 2013, the Singapore Gastric Cancer Consortium, which brings together gastric cancer experts in the country, started the trial with the additional step of inserting the liquid chemotherapy drug.\nThe response rate is impressive... There are minimal side effects and their quality of life improved.\nPatients have a metal port (that looks like a bottle cap) permanently planted in the abdomen. The liquid is inserted and removed through this opening.\nThe peritoneal chemotherapy is done twice within a three-week cycle, and the entire procedure is repeated eight times over a 24-week period.\nBecause the drug used is a big molecule, very little of it is absorbed into the rest of the body, said Prof So, who described the procedure as a \"simple, outpatient treatment\".\nChemotherapy drugs are toxic and can also damage healthy cells in the body, so it is good that very little is absorbed.\nSaid Prof So: \"Of 17 patients who had cancer cells in the peritoneum, after the treatment, 11 had no more cancer cells in the peritoneum, but still had cancer in the stomach.

Frolov, 28, has skated in 536 career regular season contests with the Los Angeles Kings, registering 168 goals and 213 assists for 381 points, along with 210 penalty minutes. He has recorded 24 multi-goal games in his career, including three career hat-tricks.\nIn 2006-07, Frolov established career-highs in games played (82), goals (35), assists (36) and points (71). He led the Kings in goals and game-winning goals (six) that season, and finished second on the team in points. He was one of only two players on the roster that appeared in all 82 games, and tied for third on the team in shots on goal (195).\nIn 2008-09, Frolov led the team in goals (32) and power play goals (12) while finishing second on the team in points (59) and power play points (25). It marked the third time in his career that he led the Kings in goals, having previously led his team in goals in 2003-04 and 2006-07. Frolov also led the Kings and ranked sixth in the NHL with an 18.2 shooting percentage. He registered 14 multi-point efforts, leading Los Angeles to an 11-1-2 record in those contests.\nOn January 21, 2009, Frolov tallied two goals at Colorado, including his 20th of the season to become the first Kings player to record at least 20 goals in five straight seasons since Luc Robitaille registered eight consecutive 20-goal seasons from 1986-87 to 1993-94.

The gaggle of young women standing outside the library are discussing politics, not hairstyles.\n\"You can't believe what you see on the telly, it's all lies,\" one says to her friend. She is trying to persuade her to vote \"Yes\" in Thursday's referendum on Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom.\nWith less than 24 hours to go before the polls open, their conversation is an indication of the way in which the independence debate has helped to create the most politically engaged generation in Scottish history.\nRosemary Dickson, the chief executive of FARE, an Easterhouse-based charity that works with young people, says it is different from any other election in her lifetime.\n\"It doesn't matter where you go, the shopping centre's behind the counter or the person serving you in the cafe or the person you meet in the street, everybody is engaged in this conversation.\"\nI have heard a lot more positives from the 'Yes' campaign than I have from the no camp.

It is another way in which this referendum is unique.\nSince the last Scottish Parliament election in 2011, more than 330,000 people have been added to the electoral roll. The Scottish government estimates about one-third of these are teenagers. In a tight contest, that could be enough to swing the result.\nFive of the hairdressers say they are voting \"Yes\", and just one is against.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s also a sad fact of life that the role of a school nurse \u2014 who is on campus to help insure students\u2019 well-being \u2014 often goes overlooked or underestimated.\nOne item heard during a special meeting of the Burbank school board Friday afternoon was a plea for help from the BUSD\u2019s head nurse, Lenora Aguilera, who maintains there are simply not enough certificated nurses to serve the needs of students. A look at the numbers would suggest she has the hard facts on her side: Just six nurses must divide their time caring for 15,200 Burbank students, a ratio of about one nurse for every 2,500 children. Compare that to the federal guideline established 14 years ago that calls for one school nurse per 750 students.\nAccording to a survey taken in 2000 by the University of Iowa, children who are ministered to by adults who are not certified nurses can be placed at risk, especially when it comes to errors in medication doses. \u201cMistakes are more than three times as likely to occur when an unlicensed person and not a (school) nurse is responsible,\u201d the Journal of School Health reported that year.\nWe understand that the Burbank school board regularly faces difficult decisions about where to spend dollars that are hard to come by. But we hope that the committee that\u2019s assessing the district\u2019s priorities in conjunction with the state-mandated Local Control and Accountability Plan take very seriously Aguilera\u2019s words.

But he said both men, former officials of the National Security Council staff, should ''make a great sacrifice'' by answering the questions of panels investigating the controversy. ''The country cannot wait any longer,'' he said.\nMr. Bush's comments came three days after President Reagan urged the Senate Intelligence Committee to grant limited immunity to Admiral Poindexter, who resigned as national security adviser, and Colonel North, a member of the security council staff who was dismissed.\nMr. Reagan, responding to Congressional criticism about the level of Administration cooperation in the investigation, said immunity would be a way of getting the facts without depriving the two officers of their rights. The President had said earlier this month that he did not expect present or former aides to waive their rights under the Fifth Amendment in order to assist investigations by Congress and the Justice Department.\nMr. Bush said in his speech that because Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North are military officers ''they take on a special obligation.'' and indicated that they therefore ought to say what they know even if it was not in their own interest.\nMr. Bush made the comments in a speech to the graduating class of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy.

''People have died face down in the mud all over the world defending those individual rights.''said testimony given in closed session of Congressional panels investigating the Iran affair should be made public, and urged that the Congress not abandon its support of the Nicaraguan rebels as a result of the controversy.

Kavanaugh denied the allegations and denied being at the party where Ford claims the alleged incident occurred.\nWhen the allegations first surfaced Thursday, 65 former female classmates of Kavanaugh at Georgetown Prep lent their names to a letter vouching for his character. Two dozen alumnaes from Ford's Maryland prep school signed a letter supporting her.\nThe claims have led Democrats to argue for a pause on Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans say it is a stall tactic to give Democratic candidates an issue to campaign on.\nJones said the motivation for investigating is to get to the truth and that there is no reason for the Senate not to be thorough.\n\"This is not an effort to intentionally delay, it's an effort on my part to say we need to get this right,\" he said. \"It's in the 11th hour only because of the artificial deadline that Republicans put out there. ...I just think pushing forward is showing an incredible lack of respect for Dr. Ford.\"\nNoting that Ford has received death threats, Jones said the Judiciary Committee should give Kavanaugh's accuser time to prepare.\n\"It's not easy to get prepared for a hearing like this, and I've been in this position before where you had to do something at the last minute and it's just not good,\" he said.\nThe senator said he is still keeping an open mind on Kavanaugh's nomination.\nUpdated at 2:43 p.m. to indicate that Jones believes a Monday hearing would be a spectacle, not a closed-door hearing."}

The SLPP Chairman said so in response to a query by The Island at a media conference at Battaramulla Nelum Mawatha Office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.\nAsked whether the JO parliamentary group would quit 21-member Steering Committee headed by PM Ranil Wickremesinghe as demanded by National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa last year, MP Alahapperuma said the government couldn\u2019t continue with the project in accordance with 2015 mandate.\nColombo District MP and JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena and Gampaha District MP Prasanna Ranatunga represent the JO in the Steering Committee spearheading the constitution making process.\nProf. Peiris said the people had rejected yahapalana foreign as well as economic policies.

Comparing the mandate received by yahapalana rulers in 2015 and the LG polls result, Gammanpila pointed out that the SLPP had comfortably secured 16 electoral districts and of them six were taken without conceding a single local body to coalition partners.\nGammanpila said President Sirisena had invited UNP leader Wickremesinghe to form a new government in the wake of Rajapaksa\u2019s defeat at the presidential election in Jan. 2015 though he commanded only 46 members of parliament (including himself). \"We now have 54 members in parliament,\" Gammanpila reminded the government.

Although amino acid supplementation can be beneficial for athletic performance in some circumstances, according to a 2007 review published in the \u201cJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,\u201d they don\u2019t directly affect an athlete\u2019s energy level.\nTaking branched-chain amino acid supplements may decrease fatigue during prolonged aerobic exercise, maintain muscle mass and aid in muscle recovery after exercise, according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition's position stand on protein and exercise. Examples of branched-chain amino acids include leucine, isoleucine and valine. You can also get all your essential amino acids by eating high-quality, complete proteins found in lean meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, soy and dairy products; but amino acid supplements may be more convenient for athletes to consume prior to, during and immediately after athletic events.\nAlthough amino acids and proteins play a crucial role in muscle development, maintenance and repair after workouts, carbohydrates are actually an athlete\u2019s main fuel source during\u2014and after\u2014exercise. According to Brown University, carbs should make up 65 percent of an athlete\u2019s total calorie intake, or about 488 grams of carbs per day for an athlete who eats 3,000 calories a day.\nAmino acid supplements are not tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, you run the risk of contamination or getting prohibited substances\u2014not listed on the supplement facts label\u2014in amino acid supplements. These supplements can also be quite pricey, especially when you can meet your amino acid needs by following a well-balanced diet.\nProtein needs are higher among athletes, compared with inactive individuals\u2014but you can still easily meet your protein\u2014and amino acid\u2014needs from foods. The International Society of Sports Nutrition suggests athletes consume 1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or about .64 to 0.91 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day; this is equivalent to 112 to 159 grams of protein each day for a 175-pound athlete.

The story line starts back with Zennstr_m and Friis developing the now infamous Kazaa file sharing program. Like many other similar programs the application is built using a technology called FastTrack which was developed by Estonian programmers headed by Jaan Tallinn, with Ahti Heinla and Priit Kasesalu under contract to the Kazaa/Skype boys.\nNow when things got a little hot in the kitchen and Zennstr_m and Friis bailed out of Kazaa, they worked with the same Estonian programmers to develop the Skype application. Though Skype has been extremely coy about giving away too much about the workings of its VoIP service, it\u2019s fairly obvious it uses some sort of P2P technology.\nIf this case comes to court we may find out a little more about how this growing security risk operates under the hood, which would be a good thing.\nAnyway, in bailing out of the Kazaa operation its founders sold the program a Sharman Networks which is based in Vanuatu, though its main offices are in Sydney, hence the local Kazaa trial. The whole deal was described by the Washington Post as a \u2018shell game\u2019 used to elude prosecution. It\u2019s exactly what went on, what was sold and who now owns it that would become the focus of any trial if this case goes to court.\nKazaa and StreamCast\u2019s Morpheus both used the same FastTrack technology developed by the Estonians. Once the acquisition of Kazaa by Sharman was complete, Morpheus users were cut off from the network. A bit of a tussle ensued, but in the end StreamCast found a new platform for Morpheus and Kazaa, well we know about Kazaa.\nOne of the key points in the Kazaa prosecution has been whether it is a centralised or de-centralised network. This was an important point in the Kazaa trial as the FastTrack technology it was launched with used a distributed, movable index compared to its forerunner Napster which relied on company operated servers to maintain the index.\nThis was Napster\u2019s undoing in the courts and it also placed significant strain on the servers when the user base grew astronomically. Tallinn built FastTrack in a different way where the system independently searched for suitable servers attaching to the network and used them to hold the indexing.\nNow while the Kazaa trail in Australia found that Sharman had breached copyright through its failure to attempt to curtail illegal file-sharing it did not find that the system was a centralised one, indicating that it most likely was/is still based on the FastTrack protocols.\nThat\u2019s almost a sideline issue, because StreamCast is suing Zennstr_m and Friis, their company is now all cashed up after selling Skype to eBay for US$4.1 billion last year.\nStreamCast alleges that the Fast"}

{"idx": "23470", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Color Corrector feature adversely affected color decoding, adding red push. It's best left off. The DTE function, which supposedly enhances detail, didn't visibly increase the sharpness of the picture. The Detail Enhancer definitely introduced some horizontal and vertical edge enhancement, so leave it off too. The Black Corrector feature simply changes the black level, so leave it off or else turn it on before setting the brightness or black level properly. The Clear White feature appeared to improve white-field uniformity a bit, but it also tinted the picture blue. Again, leave it off for the best performance. Gamma Corrector provides several choices that affect the grayscale tracking and the low-level brightness. Once again, the Off setting produced the smoothest transition from black to white, with the best grayscale tracking. Finally, for professionals, the White Balance menu has grayscale controls for calibration, which work extremely well (see Performance for details).\nIn terms of overall picture quality, the Sony KDS-R60XBR1 sets a new benchmark for fixed-pixel rear-projection HDTVs. It's easily the best LCoS-based display we've reviewed so far and the best we've seen among the current crop of 1080p HDTVs. While blacks are not quite as rich and inky as on the best DLP sets we've reviewed, this Sony can produce deep enough blacks to provide a solid overall contrast ratio and make exceptionally dark material such as Alien, Seven, or the Star Wars flicks look very convincing. The extremely difficult opening scene of the Alien: Director's Cut DVD, with the Nostromo traveling through space, was more than watchable, with only a hint of low-level noise and no real false-contouring artifacts.\nThe Sony KDS-R60XBR1's color decoding is quite accurate. As long as we left the Color Corrector turned off, we detected no red push. The green decoding was excellent as well. This, combined with a nearly flawless grayscale, enabled the set to produce extremely realistic flesh tones and natural-looking colors. (Author's note: My field experience calibrating the new Sony SXRD sets makes me skeptical about the nearly perfect grayscale our review sample had before calibration. I am typically finding the Warm color temperature setting in the 9,000K range, which leads me to suspect that Sony may have tweaked the sample sent to CNET.) However, the actual colors of red, green, and blue are not accurate according to the ATSC standard. Red is on the orange side, green is a little yellow, and blue is somewhat purplish.\nThe video processing uses Sony's DRC system with 2:3 pull-down, but it's still noisy and prone to artifacts. We ran 480p via the component-video outputs of an older Denon 2900 DVD player and got a cleaner picture than with the interlaced output. Bright scenes from the great Vertical Limit DVD looked excellent overall, with impressive color saturation and detail.\nHDTV on the Sony KDS-R60XBR1 looked awe-inspiring.

Rick Scott has thrown his support behind Donald Trump and called on Florida Republicans to unite behind the brash real estate tycoon, Marco Rubio loyalists just aren't there yet.\n\"It is very difficult for me to see Rubio move on,\" said state Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice, a member of Rubio's Florida leadership team. \"I feel Marco had the best qualities of any of the other 17 candidates that had put themselves out there. All of the rest of the candidates are seriously flawed.\"\nHe's hardly alone. More than a half-dozen members of Rubio's leadership team in Florida said over the past 48 hours that they are not ready to unite behind Trump, with many leaving open the possibility of never getting behind him and holding out a glimmer of hope that a contested Republican National Convention could revive Rubio's chances.\nFor those running for re-election and facing Republican primaries in the fall, supporting Trump or not has consequences that could affect their own races.\nRather than committing, many are just staying out of the discussion altogether.\nInstead of endorsing any of the three remaining candidates, U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, Rubio's co-chairman for Florida, said he's simply \"taking a break\" for a while and focusing on his own campaign for re-election in a newly redrawn congressional district where he has a Republican primary opponent. Charlotte County Republican John Sawyer III has filed to challenge Rooney in a district that includes Central Florida citrus areas from Polk County south to Lake Okeechobee.\nState Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, an early Rubio supporter, said as of Wednesday he had no plans to endorse another presidential candidate.\n\"For the moment, I'm staying on the sidelines. \u2026 I'm focused on my campaign and my race in 2016,\" said Diaz de la Portilla, who's seeking re-election in what's expected to be a very competitive general election campaign against State Rep.

You can only imagine if Marco would have continued in the process and been elected what it would have meant to our area,\" such as money for infrastructure and local projects and a national spotlight on Miami-Dade, Diaz de la Portilla said.\nAlthough Scott has urged the GOP to rally around Trump, Diaz de la Portilla said he thinks it's best to let the process play out.\nOn Wednesday, the day after Trump easily carried Florida, Scott said through a Facebook post: \"I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump.\"\nDespite that plea from his boss, Lt.

The 10-15 second recorded announcement, played some three hours after Flight BA286 took off, told the 391 passengers that the Boeing 747 was about to crash into the sea and to put on life jackets and adopt the brace position.\nThankfully, it was only a foolish prank by an irresponsible passenger. Crew members quickly realized the error, switched off the tape, went around reassuring passengers, and the captain apologized for the mishap.\nMore recently, a friend experienced a real emergency on a commercial jet airliner when a serious mechanical problem developed just after takeoff from Orlando International. The pilot announced over the speakers that the passengers should prepare for a crash landing.\nMy friend relates: \"An older lady seated next to me was almost hysterical with fear. But I gently put my hand on her hand and said, 'Ma'am, everything is going to be all right. Jesus has assured me.' Astonishingly, no longer than a minute later, the captain came back on the speaker and said that everything was now back to normal! He gave no explanation. We were both stunned at this miraculous and sudden manifestation of God's power.\"\nHe continues, \"How did I know what to say to the lady? Well, I believed God had led me to take that trip, for a purpose, which had not been fulfilled. Therefore, I was not rattled when the emergency occurred and had an inward assurance that everything would be okay. I knew that God would take care of it. When it happened, I simply thanked God that He was in control and that He was going to keep me safe, and thus the airplane and its passengers safe. I thanked Him for His angels, which He had given charge over me according to Psalm 91:11. By faith, I knew they were there and I knew we were safe. I simply told the lady what I knew. I believe that my faith, expressed through my words, released God's power into that situation, averting the emergency. It was a great witness to the lady and her husband. But as a former pilot, I was shocked at how fast the mechanical problem disappeared. It remained a mystery. But I know God's power solved the problem.\"\nWhether we are the victim of pranks or real emergencies, let us always react to them with faith in God's Word, protection, faithfulness, and power.

{"idx": "23475", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Should Ex-Presidents Be Put to Death?\nSir: In party platforms, and even in candidates\u2019 letters of acceptance, every one naturally looks for loose, illogical, and inconsequential political thought. When, however, a man like Mr. R. H. Dana, Jr., takes up his pen in the North American Review we have a right to expect something better. In his political article in the January number of that periodical, Mr. Dana adopts the proposition of making the President ineligible for re-election, on the ground that, being thus deprived of all selfish inducement thereto, he will not abuse his power and patronage by using it as a political weapon. The doors of preferment being closed upon him, the President of the future will devote himself wholly to the present and to immortality! You have already pointed out in your columns the singular practical illustration of this theory in the recent public action of President Grant. Going out of power himself, he has exerted his whole official influence and patronage, as no President ever allowed it to be exerted before, to secure the succession to the candidate of the party which he (the President) says \u201che represents.\u201d Mr. Dana surely, therefore, must have seen that the remedy he proposes does not meet the difficulty. Ineligibility does not secure impartiality. What, then will ? Clearly we must go further.\nIt is obvious, the fact that a President cannot be reelected by no means deprives him of all interest in the election of his successor. But the hope of reward or political office, as well as partisanship, may induce him to sell his influence to a candidate. Logic must teach us, then, to guard against this danger, and a Constitutional amendment disqualifying one who has been President from ever holding any office of trust, honor, or emolument might meet the case, and deserves consideration. Even this, however, would not ensure unselfish devotion. Presidents may be poor men, they may have families; after a brief term in the Presidency they must have the means of decently ending a life in retirement. Here is a terrible temptation for poor human nature. Surely it should he cut off. Logically I can see, therefore, but one remedy for that great evil. To ensure in our Presidents a perfectly unselfish and unpartisan devotion to the duties of their great position, they must he so situated that they cannot possibly draw any benefit from abusing them. If every President knew that he was, like Lincoln, to die in office, he would strive to make his administration worthy to rank with Lincoln\u2019s. Worldly ambition would be eliminated from his official thoughts. I would suggest, therefore, that death, and not ineligibility or disqualification, is the true Constitutional remedy for the political evil which Mr. Dana so acutely points out. The President throughout his term should be elevated by the thought that when he lays his office down it will be to join the select circle of the immortals. Under these circumstances we might surely count on our Presidents putting worldly motives behind them; and surely it would add greatly to the impressiveness and solemnity of our now somewhat meagre inaugural ceremonies if it were made the Constitutional duty of the Chief-Justice to immediately put to death, before all the people, the old President, after administering the oath to the new one. This would be a complete, as well as both logical and philosophical, remedy for a confessed Constitutional defect. X. Y. Z."}

And yes, I mean works, plural. This 10-episode show isn\u2019t an adaptation of any one particular King tome but, rather, is a project that synthesizes elements from many of his novels (both popular and lesser-known) for an all-new supernatural mystery set in one of his favorite fictional haunting spots: the quiet Maine town of Castle Rock.\nCreated by Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason, and executive produced by J.J. Abrams\u2014himself a King aficionado who for years tried to shepherd a long-form version of the author\u2019s The Dark Tower to the screen\u2014Castle Rock is, first and foremost, a showcase for Holland, the 38-year-old actor who initially made a splash in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s superlative small-screen Cinemax effort The Knick, and followed that up with unforgettable turns in Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma and Barry Jenkins\u2019 2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight. Here, he\u2019s magnetic as Henry Deaver, a criminal defense attorney who handles death row cases in Houston, to little success. After his latest failure, which ends in grim fashion, he receives a phone call from his home town of Castle Rock, informing him that Shawshank State Prison now houses a perplexing new inmate\u2014who\u2019s asked for Deaver personally.\nGiven that he doesn\u2019t have any clients back in Maine, Deaver finds this request intriguing, and the more he learns about the person requesting his help, the stranger things become. The individual in question is a tall, gaunt nameless kid (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, aka IT\u2019s Pennywise) who barely speaks, and who was discovered by prison guard Dennis Zalewski (Noel Fisher)\u2014the man who called Deaver\u2014in a cage at the bottom of a giant water tank located in a Shawshank wing that\u2019s been closed for decades due to a catastrophic fire. Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s weirdo isn\u2019t on any of the facility\u2019s record books, which means his clandestine confinement was likely due to the previous warden, Dale Lacy (Terry O\u2019Quinn). Problem is, no one can interrogate Lacy about this situation, because at the beginning of episode one, he kills himself at a bluff at Castle Lake\u2014the same place that, in 1991, Deaver himself was discovered in the dead of winter, unharmed, after going missing for eleven days.\nHenry doesn\u2019t remember what took place during that fateful adolescent hiatus, but while he was MIA, his adopted preacher-father was pushed off the bluff, resulting in injuries that eventually led to his death. Deaver was thus suspected of murder, and that reputation\u2014and his faulty memory\u2014haunts him as he returns to his old stomping ground. There, he grapples with unsettling unknowns about himself, his father\u2019s demise and Lacy\u2019s suicide, as well as reconnects with his forgetful mother Ruth (Sissy Spacek), her new boyfriend Alan Pangborn (Scott Glenn)\u2014the former sheriff"}

Such irritants during the poll season might offset whatever political benefit the NDA government could get through the tax sops for small businesses.\nBesides, with the government being firm on sticking to the fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP for the current fiscal, denting GST revenue further is something it can ill afford. The government\u2019s average monthly GST revenue for this fiscal now stands at a little over `94,700 crore compared with around `90,000 crore in FY18. That means a shortfall of 20% for the Centre.\nGST collections for July came in at `93,960 crore, down 2.5% from the receipts in the previous month and reversing the recent trend of a gradual month-on-month increase in the mop-up. The rate cuts for 88 items and 24 services announced on July 21 to give relief to MSMEs and customers did have an impact on the collections. The impact of the rate cuts could be more pronounced for August.\nAlthough the council set up a group of ministers (GoM) in its last meeting held on August 4 to formulate a plan for further relief to MSMEs, the panel hasn\u2019t met even once since. Three panels of tax officials \u2014 law, fitment and IT \u2014 are tasked with assisting the GoM but even these have only met once each and that too without any major outcome.\nAs the council meets here on September 28 for its 30th session, it\u2019s unlikely to have an interim report from the GoM for consideration.\n\u201cTax officials and the political dispensation are wary of implementing new measures close to general elections. Apart from revenue considerations, we also have to factor in the IT-related issues that may arise after implementation,\u201d a source said. As FE reported earlier, due to similar apprehensions, the government will likely defer the new return-filing system, crucial to check evasion, to after the general elections.\nThe plan to provide more relief to MSMEs was based on the fact that many small taxpayers were exempt from the excise duty in the pre-GST regime, but their tax liability now is equivalent to a combination of excise and VAT, which is believed to have deprived them of their competitive advantage. Excise duty had kicked in at a turnover threshold of Rs 1.5 crore.\nIncentives for MSMEs will come with adverse revenue implications, but sources said even a small quantum of relief would cover a large part of the tax base, given that small taxpayers contribute only a small fraction of the GST revenue. According to official data, registered taxpayers up to turnover of Rs 1 crore constitute over 78% of the total base, but contribute less than 7% to the revenue collection.

It's not an open window,\" says James Scullary, spokesperson for Covered California.\nNot all big life changes can alter your insurance coverage \u2014 at least not immediately.\nAt the same time that Tom Jones and his wife learned they were having a baby, they found out that her current insurance policy, which was in place before the Affordable Care Act became law, doesn't include maternity benefits.\nA tax preparer, Jones, who lives in Lake Forest, says he knew that certain changes to life circumstances, like having a baby, triggered an opportunity to switch health plans. He assumed his wife's pregnancy would qualify. It didn't. \"I was kind of surprised when I found out there wasn't a special enrollment period for pregnancy,\" he says.\n\"Pregnancy doesn't allow you to switch plans,\" says Michael Mahoney, a senior vice president with Chicago-based online broker GoHealth. \"But it allows you to add the child to the plan.\"\nLosing insurance. According to Covered California, about 4 in 10 of the nearly 130,000 people who qualified for a special enrollment period this year did so because they lost their insurance coverage. Nationwide, it's even more common, according to EHealth, an online health insurance broker.\nThe reasons for losing insurance are varied, says Betsy Imholz, special projects director with Consumers Union, the parent organization of Consumer Reports. The loss of a job-based plan, aging out of a parent's coverage at the age of 26, losing coverage through divorce, or losing eligibility for Medi-Cal, the state's insurance program for people with low incomes, trigger a special enrollment period.\nImholz says she worries that many people aren't aware that after leaving or losing their job they can sign up for a plan through Covered California that qualifies them for a tax credit to lower their insurance costs.\n\"People feel COBRA is their only option,\" she says.\nIf you continue your current job-based health plan through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act), you'll have to hold onto that policy until it ends or the next annual open enrollment comes around when you can sign up for a new plan. Canceling COBRA before it expires does not count as a qualifying event triggering a special enrollment period.\n\"Once you take COBRA, you can't just drop it,\" Imholz says.

(Nasdaq: SCHN) today reported a loss per share from continuing operations of $0.05 for the fiscal 2017 first quarter ended November 30, 2016 and an adjusted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.03. Reported and adjusted first quarter results include an adverse impact on operating costs in the Steel Manufacturing Business (SMB) of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.09 per share, resulting from outages related to a major equipment upgrade and maintenance downtime. In comparison, the Company had a loss per share from continuing operations of $0.19 in the prior year first quarter and an adjusted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.13. For a reconciliation of the adjusted results to U.S. GAAP, please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures provided after the financial statements in this document.\nAuto and Metals Recycling (AMR) delivered its best first quarter performance since fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher benefits achieved from the successful execution of cost reduction and productivity initiatives and improved market conditions. In the Steel Manufacturing Business (SMB), continued pressure from low-priced imports on finished steel selling prices and volumes, combined with the higher operating costs associated with a major equipment upgrade and maintenance downtime, adversely impacted results as compared to the prior year and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe Company currently expects AMR's operating income for the second quarter to increase sequentially and year-over-year driven by the continued improvements in market conditions for recycled metals. AMR's second quarter performance is expected to reflect higher ferrous average selling prices and sales volumes and an anticipated favorable impact from average inventory accounting, as well as continued benefits from previously announced cost reduction and productivity initiatives. The Company currently anticipates SMB's second quarter performance to be slightly improved from the first quarter due to higher selling prices, with the elimination of the expenses associated with the equipment upgrade expected to be offset by higher raw material costs and higher inventory costs associated with low production volumes resulting from the downtime.\n\"In the first quarter, AMR delivered a substantial increase in operating income compared to the prior year quarter, largely due to the increased contributions from the successful implementation of our cost savings and productivity initiatives. In the second quarter, our expectations for improved performance are underpinned by the stronger market environment that we are experiencing as well as continued progress on our strategic initiatives to reduce costs, deliver internally-generated synergies and drive further productivity initiatives,\" commented Tamara Lundgren, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n(2) An adjustment of certain intrasegment items was made between nonferrous revenue and retail and other revenue for the quarter ended November 30, 2015 to conform with the presentation for the quarter ended November 30, 2016. The adjustment had no impact on previously reported total revenues or earnings.\n(4) Segment operating income (loss) does not include the impact of restructuring charges and other exit-related activities.\nVolumes: Ferrous sales volumes in the first quarter were 4% higher versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to stronger export demand.

But AP still has not yet called the race, even with all votes now tabulated.\nSecretary of State Deb Markowitz, who had led early Tuesday evening, wasn\u2019t far behind with 24.1 percent of the vote, but still trailed Racine by 494 votes. Former state Sen. Matt Dunne, now the head of Google\u2019s community affairs division, was taking 21 percent, while state Sen. Susan Bartlett was getting only 5 percent.\nThe race appears headed for a recount. Under Vermont law, if the first vote count shows a statewide candidate down by less than 2 percent, the trailing candidate can request a recount, and both Racine and Markowitz fall within that margin.\nAlthough Vermont polls closed the earliest on Tuesday, at 7 p.m. ET, the vote tabulation proved among the slowest of the evening, likely due to the state\u2019s hybrid tally system. According to the state\u2019s Division of Elections, 140 Vermont towns count their ballots by hand, while 106 towns use optical scanners.\nWhoever does officially emerge from the Democratic contest will face GOP Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie this fall in the race to succeed retiring Republican Gov. Jim Douglas, who\u2019s served four two-year terms. Dubie faced no primary opposition. Vermont and New Hampshire are the only states that still elect their governors to two-year terms.\nIf Shumlin does win, the general election would serve as a rematch of the state\u2019s 2002 lieutenant governor\u2019s race, which Dubie won.\nLittle public polling had been done among the quintet of Democrats, but state political observers had correctly predicted a close contest. All the candidates were longtime state officeholders who had waited years in the wings for an open-seat governor\u2019s race, not wanting to face the popular Douglas, who had easily won each of his three reelection campaigns since winning a close 2002 race against Racine.\nThe five candidates held an unprecedented 60 debates across the state over the past several months. But perhaps most stunning was that throughout those debates, amid a crowded primary, the candidates all ran unusually cordial and positive campaigns. Instead of hitting one another, they focused their fire on Dubie for what was expected to be a close November contest no matter which Democratic candidate won the nomination. The candidates were mostly united on key issues \u2014 all were pro-choice, backed health care reform and supported expanding broadband coverage throughout the state."}

That\u2019s the unenviable task of Pastor Matio Tindano (52) in rural Burkina Faso.\nBurkina Faso is the world\u2019s third poorest nation according to the United Nations. But it is also Bible poor.\nOut of the West African country\u2019s staggering 66 languages, only seven have even a New Testament. The rest have nothing.\nIn a largely Muslim and animist nation this has made spreading the Gospel difficult.\nBut, that could be set to change, thanks to a scheme sponsored by Biblefresh, a group of more than 40 Christian organisations here in Britain.\nAs part of the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible, Christians across the UK are being encouraged to get back into the Good Book \u2013 and help bring the Bible to Matio and many more like him.\nHow? Wycliffe Bible Translators and Bible Society are working together with local people to translate the Old Testament into the Bissa Lebir language and the New Testament into the neighbouring Bissa Barka language, both spoken widely in rural Burkina Faso.\nThis would ultimately bring the life-changing message of God\u2019s love to more than 580,000 people.\nMatio and his family are Bissa Barka speakers. Currently, the Bible isn\u2019t available in their language. And that makes it hard for Matio to help lead the congregation in the village of Garango.\nUndeterred, Matio preaches in the local tongue \u2013 Bissa Barka \u2013 but all Bible readings have to be done in the unpopular Moore or the national language, French. Anecdotally however, it seems that locally as many as 90% of people don\u2019t speak French, making the Bible a closed book, even to Christians.\nPastor Timothee Balbone (49) is the president of the Assemblies of God Church for the Bissa region. He says that the absence of a Bible in their language limits people\u2019s understanding of their own beliefs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThere cannot be much depth to people\u2019s faith. It\u2019s not really easy to lead people without having a Bible because you try to teach people something, but they can\u2019t remember what you\u2019ve said, as nothing is written down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a happy situation. We don\u2019t like it, but we have to cope with it.\n\u201cHaving the Bissa Barka New Testament will be a miracle,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate for days. Old people will be able to understand it. They\u2019ll just read it and know.\nBack at Pastor Matio\u2019s house, the struggle to try to understand the Bible continues. To read anything, his family use two different translations and a couple of dictionaries.\nHis wife, Agratou (43) admits that sometimes the effort is just too much.\n\u201cOften I don\u2019t read the Bible because it\u2019s just too difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery time I read the Bible to my children, I have to translate it so that they can understand. It\u2019s been hard.\nChristians in the UK are being asked to give \u00a31 for every Bible that they own to help start the work that will result in people like Matio and Agratou being able to read a Bible easily in their home.\nJust \u00a330 could translate a short passage, such as the parable of the sower; \u00a370 could pay for an account of Jesus\u2019 feeding of the 5,00"}

{"idx": "23508", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Google said on Thursday, November 30 that it released a new AIY Vision do-it-yourself kit based on the Raspberry Pi Zero W board. The kit follows Google\u2019s recent AIY Voice Kit for DIY voice recognition, and provides means for your project to include image recognition without the need for a connection to the cloud. That ability stems from the kit\u2019s vision processing unit, which is capable of running local neural network models.\nAccording to Google, the kit includes software supporting three separate neural network models. One model can detect people, cats, and dogs while another specializes in faces and their expressions. The third model is capable of recognizing \u201ca thousand common objects.\u201d You can even train and retrain your own neural network models using a TensorFlow-based tool built into the software.\n\u201cWe also provide a Python API that gives you the ability to change the RGB button colors, adjust the piezo element sounds and access the four GPIO pins,\u201d Google said.\nAt the heart of the kit\u2019s design is the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W board. It\u2019s a self-contained computer consisting of a single-core processor, 512MB of memory, Wireless N and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity, and several connectors. The kit\u2019s included \u201cVisionBonnet\u201d accessory board packing Intel\u2019s Movidius MA2450 vision processing chip connects to the Raspberry Pi\u2019s CSI camera connector via a flex cable.\nThe assembly instructions show that these two boards are sandwiched together via the Raspberry Pi\u2019s 40-pin header, and secured in place using plastic standoffs. Meanwhile, the $30 Raspberry Pi Camera 2 plugs into a special slot on the kit\u2019s inner cardboard frame, and then plugs into the CSI camera connector on the VisionBonnet board via a flex cable. Eventually, the base device is enclosed in an additional cardboard shell containing an LED, camera lens, and tripod mount.\nRight now, you can pre-order the kit only through Micro Center for $45, but it won\u2019t become available until December 31. The drawback is that Google\u2019s kit does not include the Raspberry Pi Zero W board, the Raspberry Pi Camera 2, or the required blank Micro SD card. Note that this card needs at least 4GB to store the downloadable software required for the device to work, and you\u2019ll also need a utility to install the software onto the card.\nUltimately, the complete image-recognition device for your project will set you back around $85. Add Google\u2019s AIY voice kit, and your project will have the ability to recognize people, animals, objects, and voices. But that\u2019s another $25 just for the kit, which doesn\u2019t include the required $35 Raspberry Pi 3 board, or the SD card needed to store the operating system and voice-recognition software.\nSo what can you do with image recognition? Google lists a few examples, such as detecting when your dog approaches the back door, sounding an alarm when a sibling creeps into your room, and witnessing the reactions of your neighbors when they view your Griswold-style holiday decorations. The kit sounds like fun if you\u2019re willing to shell out an additional $85 for your project."}

Those three firms have received $165 billion thus far, more than the $149 billion received by all other financial firms.\n\u00bb The comparison is even starker if we consider repayment. Banks are planning to repay about $70 billion in TARP investments (a bit less than $2 billion has already happened, with another $68 billion under consideration by banks that \u201cpassed\u201d the stress test). If that happens, then the outstanding TARP investment to the rest of the financial sector will fall to $79 billion, only slightly more than what AIG has received by itself.\n\u00bb The auto industry has been the other major TARP recipient, with transactions now totaling about $85 billion. These amounts have primarily gone to Chrysler and GM (both the pre- and post-bankruptcy versions), but the auto suppliers and GMAC have also been recipients.\n\u00bb As yet, the other TARP programs have received relatively little money from TARP. Efforts to support consumer and business lending through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility (TALF) have received $20 billion of TARP money thus far, and $15 billion has been allocated for efforts to encourage modifications to home mortgages.\n\u00bb The other two programs have yet to get off the ground. One program \u2014 purchasing loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) appears to be in progress, while the Public-Private Investment Partnership to purchase troubled assets has experienced some well-known difficulties.\nDisclosure: I have no investments in any TARP recipients.\nA Note on Data and Sources: The official web site for TARP has a wealth of information, including TARP transaction reports, testimonies, contract terms, etc. The New York Times also has a page tracking the program: \u201cTracking the $700 Billion Bailout\u201d as does ProPublica. You will find small differences in numbers between these sources, depending on when they were last updated and how they categorize certain TARP programs (e.g., $25 billion of the intended PPIP would be routed through the TALF). There are also subtleties about the difference between money that Treasury has actually spent vs. guarantees that it has provided. For example, Citigroup has received $45 billion in cash and has received a guarantee worth up to $5 billion. So I report Citigroup as receiving $50 billion."}

The frightening encounter, in which Bevo broke free of the metal barricades he was caged within and ran in Uga\u2019s direction, aired live just before the game.\nBevo\u2019s handlers were quick to say that the steer is \u201cas docile as a lamb\u201d and that \u201c[h]e was just going to say hi,\u201d and that may be true. Steers, like all animals, are individuals with unique personalities. It\u2019s quite possible that Bevo was simply scared by the noise, lights, and chaos in the stadium and tried to flee from the confines of his makeshift pen. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Uga or any of the humans standing nearby could easily have been trampled and killed.\nThis frightening near-tragedy is yet another example of the reason most colleges and professional sports teams retired their live-animal mascots decades ago\u2014and the handful who haven\u2019t yet should quickly follow suit.\nLive animals used as mascots, such as Baylor University\u2019s bears and the University of North Alabama\u2019s lions, are held in captivity and often denied the opportunity to fulfill many of their most basic instincts. They\u2019re frequently carted around to sporting events and public appearances, which are confusing and frightening for them.

The company that started out as a personal and business backup solution has pivoted in January to include offering cloud storage solutions and has been doing quite well with it, storing over 250 terabytes worth of user data. The service, B2, started as a beta in 2015 and released in January to good review, thanks in part to its reliability and low price point. The service can be had for cheaper than almost any other option, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure.\nWhen asked about B2, what they learned from the beta and early launch, and who it could be utilized by, Gleb Budman, CEO and co-founder of Backblaze is quoted as saying, \u201cWe learned there are an insanely broad set of use cases people and companies intend for B2, but found a few large common areas including LTO (Linear Tape Storage) tape replacement/augmentation, server and NAS backup, and the ability to transparently expand internal company storage. Also, we received a lot of usage feedback that helped us test the system, improve performance, and more.\u201d Much of that feedback and testing came during the beta and open beta stages, helping Backblaze have their full launch without so much as a hitch.\nBut in the grand scheme, Backblaze is still a small company in this space, especially considering what you see coming from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, but that isn\u2019t going to stop them from continuing to grow and be competitive. \u201cWe intend to keep offering an incredibly low-cost offering as a key benefit for customers. However, we also are a very open company, sharing everything from the design of our Storage Pods to the reliability statistics of the hard drives we use. Additionally, we are actively working with partners to build the ecosystem surrounding Backblaze B2 to make it easy for customers to use the service through a variety of products such as Synology, CloudBerry, and more,\u201d states Budman.\nThose storage pods mentioned have seen quite an improvement in the past year, as well, with multiple iterations being released in an effort to improve everything from cooling, to amount of storage, to physical space/storage space ratio. Combine that with their recent upgrade to HDDs to provide even greater amounts of storage per pod, with lower failure rates, and you have a recipe for a solid, reliable storage system.\nWhen all of these things come together, it\u2019s easy to see why the company is excited about their future. With data holding numbers already half those of established, big player, Dropbox, Backblaze continues to blaze their way through the ranks. By continuing to improve on all the pieces, from pod to product, Backblaze has no plans on not being competitive going forward and it will be exciting to see what they come up with in the next 12 months."}

The system rewards financial speculation over work: on average, engineers, inventors, designers, technologists, doctors, artists and scientists earn only a fraction of what a brat from the financial sector receives, although his contribution to the economy is to sink one company or another or embezzle the funds of pensioners.\nPolitically, this rise in inequality is creating a system that resembles a plutocracy. The right has a Supreme Court majority, and in electoral terms, this has resulted in reforms of the electoral laws that allow corporations to operate as if they were people. This gives huge advantages to candidates who enjoy corporate support, as was seen during the recent Republican primaries, in which a candidate, although more sane and presentable than his opponents, was also much less popular.\nwe must understand that there is a close relationship between abusing the human rights of foreigners and the ongoing domestic process of social exclusion must be understood. The legalization of torture at Guantanamo was, in that sense, a major defeat for the entire U.S. population, since support for such an extreme measure helped justify the loss of domestic guarantees, the hardening of criminalization and the proliferation of prisons and migrant detention centers. To all this must be added this most recent decision, which means that Arizona police now have a new tool with which to oppress the entire population with a Latino appearance, whether they are citizens or not."}

Maybe they're all just talking, but who wants it more?\nWhat everyone here does seems to want -- and given journalists' need for conflict, it's probably fair to include them in the \"everyone\" here -- is a new generation of Democratic candidates who aren't afraid to stand up for something. There's a reason that \"Lieberman\" is a dirty word here, and it's the same reason that the mention of Jon Tester, the Democratic nominee for Conrad Burns' seat in the U.S. Senate, inevitably draws applause. One man has become the symbol of Democratic appeasement; in another, progressives have poured their hopes for a new sort of tell-it-like-it-is populism.\nWhich brings us back to Tom DeLay. The Hammer gave his farewell address from the House floor Thursday, and -- if you take out the policy particulars and the allegations of criminal wrongdoing and wipe out everything you know about Tom DeLay, who he is and what he's done -- the themes he sounded were a lot like the ones we're hearing here.\nDeLay argued that all the hand-wringing about the \"recent rise in political partisanship\" is really \"nothing more than a veiled complaint\" about Republicans who push hard for their political agenda. He said that he doesn't \"begrudge\" liberals if they feel nostalgic for \"the days of a timid, docile and permanent Republican minority,\" but he insisted -- and he's certainly right on this point -- that those days are behind his party, at least for now.\nSo how do Democrats pull off the same trick? How do they go from \"docile minority\" to empowered majority? DeLay knows -- like the people gathered here know -- that you don't do it by caving in to the opposition or trying to be more like it. What you do is, you make the case that your way is a better way, and then you stand up and fight for yourself when anybody dares to say different.\n\" Now, politics demands compromise ... and even the most partisan among us have to understand that, \" DeLay said Thursday. \"But we must never forget that compromise and bipartisanship are means, not ends, and are properly employed only in the service of higher principles.\n\"It is not the principled partisan, however obnoxious he may seem to his opponents, who degrades our public debate, but the preening, self-styled statesman who elevates compromise to a first principle.

But this one really had her loyal Instagram fans confused. In the image, Cabello poses against a red wall as she flips her long dark locks back. The 21-year-old looks dressed to impress in a lacy dress that ties at her waist.\nBut where fans got a little confused and excited was the part of the photo where Camila is holding one hand on her stomach. Of course, this is not a pregnancy announcement, but many of her over 25 million followers on Instagram thought that the \u201cHavana\u201d singer was making a pregnancy announcement due to the placement of her hand.\nSo far, the photo has earned the singer a ton of attention with over 600,000 likes in addition to 8,700-plus comments and growing. Many fans took to the image to wish Cabello a congratulations after thinking that she was announcing that had a bun in the oven.\n\u201cAre u pregnant,\u201d another fan asked.\nBut countless other fans came to the defense of the singer, letting other fans know that their pregnancy claims are ridiculous.\n\u201cTo anyone here she\u2019s not pregnant and just plz leave her alone thank you and have a nice day,\u201d another commented.\nAnd Camila herself also shot down the rumors, calling fans crazy for thinking that she is expecting a child.\nAnd this isn\u2019t the only time in recent weeks where Camila Cabello has been the subject of speculation. As the Inquisitr shared earlier this month, Cabello and her former Fifth Harmony band mates Lauren Jauregui and Normani Kordei Hamilton were seated very far away from each other at the 2018 AMAs. According to multiple sources, it was planned that the ladies be seated apart from each other so as to keep the peace.\nIn 2016, Cabello announced that she would be leaving Fifth Harmony, the girl group that made her famous. Since then, there has been obvious tension between the ladies, and if they did indeed get to sit near each other, it would most likely make for an awkward situation."}

But when the Carolina Panthers fired offensive coordinator Mike Shula on Tuesday, perhaps a bit of Monty Python-style rejoicing was acceptable.\nAfter all, it looked for a few hours like Cam Newton finally might get to lead a dynamic offense that suits his talents. Also, it isn't as though the well-connected Shula will have to sweep chimneys in Victorian London for a living.\nThen Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported Norv Turner was a \"top choice\" to take over for Shula. According to ESPN.com's David Newton, he arrived in Carolina on Wednesday \"to finalize details that would make him the [team's] next offensive coordinator.\"\nSo, perhaps that rejoicing was premature.\nMeanwhile, in another change that felt long overdue, the Seahawks fired longtime offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell on Wednesday. All eyes are now on Seattle, which could either hire a fresh new voice who both maximizes Russell Wilson's strengths and provides him with some novel new features (like running backs and blockers), or it could hire a retread and trudge backward toward mediocrity.\nThe Seahawks rose to power by being creative enough to choose the former. But according to the rumor mill, they will be conventional and opt for the latter this time around.\nAs of Thursday morning, the Giants, Cardinals, Colts and Lions are still without head coaches. But who cares? The head coaching market lacks sizzle now that Jon Gruden is signed/sealed/delivered to the Raiders and the Bears gobbled up Matt Nagy, one of the few interesting new faces on the scene. The coordinator carousel is where all of the action is this year.\nPart of the problem is that the head coaching market is flooded with Baby Belichicks (Pats assistants Matt Patricia, Josh McDaniels and second-generation copy Mike Vrabel, now of the Texans), stalwart defensive lieutenants (Patricia, Vrabel, Panthers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks) and a glorified Turner riding a hot streak (Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur). Only McDaniels promises an offensive scheme to capture the imagination.\nThe remaining teams in need of head coaches are all also in need of massive rebuilds other than the Lions, who have been allergic to interesting coaching hires since Wayne Fontes' run-'n'-shoot was run out of town in 1996. Meanwhile, the coordinator upheaval involves teams on the fringe of Super Bowl contention and quarterbacks not long removed from the Super Bowl.\nNo wonder that's where all the action is.\nAnd while there is plenty of intrigue on defense\u2014the Packers' reported hiring of Mike Pettine (per ESPN's Adam Schefter), the Bears trying to retain Vic Fangio as Nagy's consigliere, brief bidding wars over Gus Bradley (who's staying with the Chargers) and Teryl Austin (whom the Bengals snatched)\u2014offensive coordinators are the coaches who can make our Sunday afternoons either entertaining or unbearable.\nShula's five seasons as Newton's coordinator were, charitably, a mixed bag.

However, software is expected to be the fastest growing category during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the increasing demand for accessibility of such signatures in connected devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops in different applications such as government, banking, financial services and insurance.\nOn the basis of deployment type, digital signature market has been categorized into cloud-based and on-premises. Cloud-based has been the dominant category, as it reduces IT cost and ensures mobility.\nDigital signature market was led by North America, where it accounted for more than 40% of the global market size in 2017, majorly due to the technological advancement in digital technology and implementation of various legislations.\nIn the U.S., some f the major legislations implemented for the digital signature technologies include Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), and Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN). These laws permit the use of these signatures in each state of the country. Similarly, in Canada, laws for electronic signature have been implemented through the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).\nThe digital signature market will witness rapid growth in Asia-Pacific region, where it is expected to register a CAGR of 31.0% during the forecast period. The major factors driving the growth of the digital signature market in Asia-Pacific are improving BFSI sector and initiatives taken by various government associations for the elimination of paper use and enhancing the use of digital technology in countries such as China and India.\nThe improving healthcare infrastructure in Asia-Pacific has increased the demand of signatures based on this technology in the region. Moreover, the increasing investment by digital signature software manufacturing companies has spurred the growth of the market. This is due to the low manufacturing cost and availability of skilled manpower in the developing countries such as China, India, Thailand.\nThe increasing acceptance of biometric component based on this technology in the BFSI sector is bolstering the growth of digital signature market. Use of this technology in biometric systems is one of the most secure methods for the identification and authentication procedures, due to its unique characteristics of the user's signature. Moreover, advancement in encryption-based security eliminates possibility of duplication. These innovative and advanced applications of the signatures based on this technology in BFSI sector are driving the growth of the digital signature market.\nAlso, these technologies help in reducing the enormous amount of time involved in filling forms, such as banking forms, insurance forms, and legal and advisory forms. The one-time digitized scanned signature can be used several times in banking and insurance procedures. The tradition of using online forms for filing income tax returns, opening of saving and credit account in banks and buying insurance have increased the demand of digital technologies, including digital signatures.\nThese signatures are helpful in eliminating frauds and thefts in many areas of security. By authentication of signatures of healthcare professionals, paper-based prescriptions can be digitally transferred from doctor to hospital's server, and then to patient's pharmacy, thus inhibiting a person's ability to manipulate or forge the doctor"}

Last week, we were given definitive timelines on the closure. What was noticeable was that there seems to be a one-sided reaction to the announcement.\nFeelings of disappointment \u2014 this goes with the territory. However, the response has been predominately about how good the economy in the area is and that the positions, with some training, can be replaced due to open positions at other manufacturing companies. St. Cloud Chamber of Commerce President Theresa Bohnen is quoted as saying it's a good thing that the community has a 2-year notice. They can work with the workforce development center to retrain the employees. This sentiment was echoed by Mayor Dave Kleis.\nWhat is absent in the discussion is what prevented Electrolux from staying in the first place. Were no attempts made to accommodate one of the largest employers in the area or any inducements offered by way of redevelopment options or options like used in Anderson County, South Carolina? They used the fee-in-lieu-of-tax (FILOT) arrangement to not only keep Electrolux, but also to encourage them to expand in their community. The result? Economic boom times for a county in South Carolina by way of over $250 million in plant investment alone. This lapse in judgement greatly affecting economic development must be blamed on some failing within the Chamber of Commerce, the Greater St. Cloud Development Corporation and the Mayor's office. This isn't the first missed opportunity, either.\nWhat are the ways our organizations that are tasked with economic development here in St. Cloud approach marketing the community to other companies for economic development? How are they spending tax payer dollars to achieve those goals? Have they been successful? How are they measuring success?\nAll of these things must be considered as we sit and watch a large contributor to not just jobs but also a tax base in greater St. Cloud leave. My thoughts turn now to what St. Cloud leadership is going to do to entice other businesses in to replace those that have been lost. This should be the parallel priority to simply moving workers to other companies. It is short-sighted to look at it any other way."}

The last extension ran out at the end of May, leaving about 2.5 million people without benefits. The House has already passed a bill to extend the benefits through November, but with the death of Sen. Robert Byrd, Senate Democrats lacked the 60 votes they needed to overcome Republican efforts to block a final vote.\nThe Senate plans to take up the measure again on Tuesday when Byrd's successor, the former chief counsel for West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, is expected to be sworn in.\nObama said lawmakers' obligation to extend benefits is both moral and practical, citing some economists who believe extending unemployment insurance is one of the most cost-effective ways to jump-start the economy because it puts money in the pockets of people who are likely to spend it quickly.\nThe $34 billion needed to extend benefits would be borrowed, adding to the nation's mounting debt. Republicans have tapped into the public's anger and concern over that debt, saying they would only support extending benefits if the bill was paid for. Obama pushed back in his address, accusing Republicans of making their stand at the expense of the unemployed \"after years of championing policies that turned a record surplus into a massive deficit.\"\nObama also called on lawmakers to send him a package of tax breaks and credit extensions for small businesses. Democrats are hoping to schedule a vote on the small business bill by the time Congress breaks for its August recess. Republican leaders say they're happy to vote, as long as they get a chance to change the bill to their liking.\nIn their weekly address, Republicans focused on Obama's recess appointment of Donald Berwick to the administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nBy appointing Berwick while the Senate was in recess, Obama was able to avoid a public hearing and Senate vote for his nominee a move Republicans have called hypocritical amid Obama's promises of transparency. Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, who delivered the address, said Berwick's recess appointment is particularly troubling given the large role he'll play in implementing the massive health care overhaul Obama signed into law earlier this year. \"The president's health care plan the most sweeping overhaul of health care in our lifetime cannot be implemented behind closed doors,\" Roberts said."}
{"idx": "23535", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Before the Bush years, Paul Krugman was simply an economist. As a young academic, he made a tremendous splash through his work on economic geography, developing what came to be known as New Trade Theory. I\u2019m not an economist, but luckily the internet is full of them and Ed Glaeser (along with a few others) has a good explanation of what Krugman\u2019s contributions were. At the most basic level, Krugman\u2019s trade work investigated something that had long gone under-analyzed in economics. Under standard Ricardian trade theory, countries have natural endowments\u2013good soil for grapes, a countryside full of sheep\u2013that give them a comparative advantage. Trade between two countries creates a net welfare gain because each country specializes in their comparative advantage and then trades with the other. In the iconic example used by Ricardo of England producing wool and Portugal producing wine, the respective comparative advantages are fairly clear and straightforward. But in an industrial age, just what determines what a country\u2019s comparative advantage is an open question. And it\u2019s one that Krugman\u2019s work attempts to answer.\nOf course, Krugman is now best known as a New York Times columnist, public intellectual, and most importantly an outspoken liberal. It wasn\u2019t always so. Krugman\u2019s politics, as even he will tell you, were generally centrist in inclination for much for his adult career. (He even had a low-level job as an economic advisor inside the -gasp-Reagan administration) But to his eternal credit, he sniffed out the fundamental mendacity of the Bush administration long before it became fashionable and was honest, direct and relentless in criticizing what is now roundly and unanimously considered one of the worst administrations in American history.\nAnd while he now proudly and eloquently declares himself a liberal, Krugman\u2019s politics remain firmly a part of the mainstream, pragmatic center left. Which is why it\u2019s so hilarious and bizarre to see him attacked from the Right as some kind of anticapitalist, radical.\nKrugman\u2019s own ideological and professional journey demonstrate two important truths about the ideological twists and turns of the last eight years. One, that the Bush administration has been so ideologically aggressive, so slavishly reactionary, they\u2019ve managed to leave all but the most committed fellow travelers behind. And two, that combination of zealotry and malfeasance has been radicalizing for many figures who used to consider themselves placid centrists. In light of the destruction that modern conservatism has wrought, Krugman has recognized the importance for progressives to embrace mobilization, organizing and power, an insight too many establishment figures were slow to grasp.\nMore than any other mainstream figure, it was Paul Krugman who recognized these developments as they were happening. He\u2019s been a truly heroic voice. We offer him our sincerest congratulations."}

All federally licensed firearms retailers must conduct a mandatory NICS check before completing the retail sale of any new or used firearm, making NICS statistics a solid indicator of firearms sales.\nThis sustained boom in the face of an unprecedented recession is evidence that Americans are sticking to their guns in times of uncertainty. And the boom continues at close to record high levels.\nThe obvious force behind the ranking is the election of Barack Obama as president in November of 2008, the month No. 1 month overall. Fear that a new internationally-minded Administration would support legislation both here and abroad that would limit civilian ownership of firearms resulted in an unprecedented surge in firearm sales that lasted through 2009 and is still being felt in the early part of 2010. The top six months for NICS checks--and 12 out of the top 17 months--have been since November 2008. The election\u2019s powerful effect on firearms purchases actually began before the votes were tallied since sales began to spike in October 2008 (No. 15 on the list) in anticipation of an Obama victory and the swing to a less gun-friendly Congress.\nOther reasons for the seasonal fluctuation of firearms sales? Just as it is for other retailers, December has always been a strong month for firearm retailers as hunting season is in full swing in most parts of the country and there&apos;s little doubt that hunters and shooters enjoy seeing that firearm they\u2019ve dropped hints about during the year winding up gift-wrapped under the holiday tree. Of the top 17 months, December ranked highest in NICS checks six times, including four of the top eight. March is also a popular month for firearm sales, too, perhaps in anticipation of a welcome tax refund from Uncle Sam. In figures just released by NICS, March 2010 was the fifth highest month ever for NICS checks.\nSo while speculation of just when the bubble will burst for the shooting and hunting industry, firearms sales remain strong in an otherwise weak economy."}

He's teased a big reveal in New York City on January 27, bringing to light the details behind the stealthy startup.\nKanojia, of course, is no stranger to swinging for the fences. His last effort was Aereo, an innovative take on online TV that used tiny microantennas to pull in free over-the-air broadcasts which it then sold to broadband users as streaming video. However, it was based on the premise that those \"free\" TV broadcasts could be resold to consumers without paying a cut to the television networks in question. Those networks -- including CNET owner CBS -- sued, and the US Supreme Court ultimately sided with them, deeming Aereo's service illegal in June 2014. It was shuttered soon after.\nSo, what exactly is Project Decibel? Info, so far, is elusive. A company spokesman declined to comment, reminding us that all will be revealed next week.\nThe Project Decibel website, meanwhile, offers a bit more info. The company is \"already over 30 people strong across RF (radio frequency) engineering, hardware architecture, firmware, UX, UI, software, industrial design, marketing, branding and communications. We all share an intense desire to make something beautiful...something that makes a real dent.\" Not terribly specific, but it pings on hardware, firmware, user experience/user interface, software and wireless.\nA few quick Google searches help flesh out those initial clues, and allows us to piece together a rough idea of what Project Decibel may be about.\nProject Decibel's own job postings and employee listings on its site and on LinkedIn bolster the idea that the company has a tangible product in mind, one that you'll actually buy. Specifically, the job postings repeatedly describe \"working on exciting consumer facing products and/or services\" that requires firmware engineers, mechanical engineers and logistics managers, along with requirements for lots of experience with RF radios and network communication in order to design.\nFaris Elmasu, senior industrial designer at Project Decibel, previously designed these Wink smart-home products for GE and Quirky.\nMore evidence for hardware: the job listings cite that \"we guarantee that if you love gorgeous industrial design, gadgets or geek out over the way brands like Apple, Nest, Casper or Uber communicate with their consumers -- we'll be a good fit for you.\" The Marketing Manager post likewise lists Canary as a brand they want to emulate.\nAccording to this job post for a UI designer, Project Decibel will have three components: a product, apps, and a website. And it sounds like Project Decibel wants to build the device soon: several of the open positions are calling for supply chain and integration experts to get the ball rolling.\nSo far, we could be describing any number of devices that might live around your house.

{"idx": "23542", "prompt": "Continue the following text: LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Great Moderation \u2013 snicker, snort. Surely, the idea that modern economies have no need for economic cycles was killed off by the great financial crisis of 2008. Like the \u201cend of history\u201d proclaimed after the fall of the Soviet Union, this notion seems to belong in the dictionary of utopian follies.\nSuch a dismissal is too hasty. The economic tools needed to avoid the overheating of booms and the underspending of busts are readily available. Indeed, they have already been put to good use.\nConsider the original source of economic cycles: the weather. For centuries, the alternation of good and bad crops would lead to sharp changes in the income and spending of farmers, and often of everyone else. Now, though, managed production, government payments, and judicious credit arrangements keep farm incomes fairly constant.\nSimilar tools have dampened inventory cycles, which succeeded the meteorological ones. Optimistic companies still sometimes produce too much and hire too many people, and their failures lead to cutbacks. However, just-in-time production and better information flows now keep supply more closely aligned with demand. Besides, judicious credit arrangements ensure that losses from inventories are modest and spread too widely to wreak economic havoc.\nThe most powerful counter-cyclical weapon is the rise of the relatively stable service sector. Services account for 70 to 80 percent of GDP in developed economies. Only a small proportion is subject to big swings in capital investment; the rest involves little more than paying people to do things. These steady payments dampen the effects of falls and increases elsewhere in the economy.\nGovernment deficit spending is another significant modern addition to the macroeconomic armoury. The government can spend when the private sector is hesitant. Monetary policy is also supposed to moderate or stimulate demand as needed.\nStill, the global meltdown that was nearing its climax a decade ago showed that the combined power of information, regulation, judicious credit and fiscal and monetary policy were not strong enough to maintain the Great Moderation which Ben Bernanke, then a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, described in 2004.\nThe central weakness was the reckless credit system. Economic cycles today are predominantly financial. Loans and financial investments are first made too freely available. Then the money is taken away too abruptly.\nThus construction, which is largely financed by debt, is especially prey to booms and busts. Financial consideration shapes the willingness of entrepreneurs to take risks, and the enthusiasm of existing companies for borrowing to pay for new capacity.\nAnd the credit cycles keep rolling along. Even though the official U.S. interest rate is rising, money is still mostly cheap around the world. The results are cheering, in the way that people under the influence of drugs are animated. GDP growth remains solid and steady, while money flows recklessly across borders and corporate credit standards decline.\nIn other words, the world is going through a less extreme version of the last Great Moderation. This one is also likely to end unhappily. The current cyclical excesses will probably be followed by another period of undue despondency.\nWhy is credit not kept under tighter control? The pattern of dangerous cycles was already clear by the 1960s, when the American economist Hyman Minsky articulated what he would later call his \u201cfinancial instability hypothesis\u201d. This can be summarised in a sentence: unless lending is heavily regulated, it will always become excessive.\nInvestors have long encapsulated Minsky\u2019"}

The anti-war stance of the newspaper on Iraq and its stance on genetically manipulated foods and other environmental issues may give the impression that the Independent is a responsible newspaper across the board. But a look at its coverage of Venezuela reveals the same old story of distortion, omission and deceit on US intervention in Latin America that one finds everywhere else in the corporate media.\nIt may be worth pointing out that the owner of the UK Independent is Tony O'Reilly, one of Ireland's most prominent businessmen, formerly head of H.J. Heinz. H.J. Heinz heiress Teresa Heinz is married to Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. Also of note is that O'Reilly shares philanthropic concerns through the Ireland Fund with fellow fund member Peter Sutherland, former GATT and World Trade Organization chief, also chairman of oil giant BP-Amoco.  It's unlikely their corporate philanthropy extends to Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president.\nThree important stories on Venezuela have appeared in the Independent during March.  One by Phil Gunson on March 2nd, one by Andrew Buncombe on March 13th, and one by Rupert Cornwell on March 20th. Phil Gunson's article is crude anti-Chavez propaganda. Buncombe's is a straightforward account of US funding for the Venezuelan opposition. Cornwell's is a more insidious anti-Chavez piece employing classic BBC-style bonhomie and \u201cbalance\u201d. Both pieces depend on ignoring crucial facts.\n\u201cThree months after the opposition umbrella group, the Democratic Co-ordinator (CD), gathered more than three million signatures for a referendum against the leftist President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's electoral authority was poised to reject the petition.\nPhil Gunson whimsically attributes to himself the authority to judge the number of signatures collected. He says nothing about the circumstances of the recall vote \u2013 which no European country would have regarded as acceptable. For example, voting lists were taken from the voting stations by opposition party representatives so as to register votes by going from house to house. The Chavez government accepted that and other abnormal voting procedures, presumably so as to quit the opposition of any excuse were they to lose the vote.\nIn the event the opposition failed to collect the necessary 2.4 million clearly valid votes they needed. They only got 1.8 million votes ratified by the national electoral council. 600.000 votes were disqualified outright by the electoral council as being obviously invalid. A further 800,000 thousand votes are in question, mainly because many of the signature forms presented as valid share identical handwriting. These questionable votes are now to be made available in voting stations to allow the people to whom the signatures were attributed a second chance to confirm their vote. Contrary to Gunson's comment, the constitutional procedure for the confirmation process is no more impractical than the original recall vote itself.\nGunson failed to get the answers he wanted from the Carter Centre or from the OAS, so he resorted to unattributed \u201cdiplomatic sources\u201d. What might count as \u201cdiplomatic sources\u201d for Phil Gunson is unclear - two US embassy staff? Or one US embassy Information Service hack and a Colombian embassy representative of death squad-friendly President Alvaro Uribe? An impartial reader cannot tell.\nSimilarly, in the penultimate paragraph Gunson refers to Chavez's \u201cincreasing authoritarianism\u201d with nothing to support"}

Some experts say replacing the TSA with private airport security firms wouldn't solve the problems causing long wait times and would do little to help this summer's busy travel season.\nLines of travelers at Denver International Airport snake their way through security on Thursday.\nThe excruciating wait times at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports the past couple of weeks have travelers fuming and some city officials looking for other options.\nChicago Alderman Ed Burke is calling on the city to do airport security the way it's done in Kansas City, San Francisco and several smaller airports around the country. He wants to hire a private company to staff the screening checkpoints.\n\"It's working in San Francisco, isn't it? And it's working in 20 other airports around the country. What we do know is it's not working here with TSA, so maybe it's an opportunity to give private industry a chance to show whether or not they can do it right,\" he says.\nOfficials in New York, Atlanta and other cities are also taking a hard look at whether privatizing airport security might move travelers through checkpoints more quickly.\n\"I look at those lines and just the enormity of that and there has to be a rapid response,\" says Joe Schwieterman, transportation professor at Chicago's DePaul University.\nBut that didn't happen. Schwieterman says TSA staffing levels are down and budget constraints limit how many new officers can be hired. But he also points out that the long lines have been building for months, reaching a crisis point, because the TSA was too slow to respond.\n\"Private firms can sort of bring something different to the table and respond much quicker. They're not governed by the same bureaucratic rules that TSA is and that would give us a little more freedom to try new things in the future just to make the system work better,\" he says.\nAll of Canada's airports and most in Europe use private security contractors.\nIn San Francisco, most travelers don't even notice that the security officers there are not TSA employees. They have similar uniforms, equipment and procedures.\nThe head of the TSA, Peter Neffenger, recently told reporters in Chicago that is by design.\n\"Remember that private contractor [is] contracted to the federal government. It still works for TSA; it's still TSA management staff that runs it,\" he says. \"The contractor doesn't work for the airport. It works for TSA, and it has to work at TSA standards and is trained at TSA standards.\"\nNeffenger says any airport in the country can apply to privatize its security, and he is open to allowing more to do so. But some experts say there's very little evidence to suggest private airport security is any better.\n\"Privatization doesn't actually solve any of the problems we have,\" says Bruce Schneier, a security expert with Harvard University's Berkman Center. \"The problem with the TSA right now is there aren't enough people for the demand and that's a function of budget. It is not a function of who signs the paychecks of agents \u2014 it's how many agents there are.\"\nAnd privatization is no quick fix. Ginger Evans, who oversees Chicago's airports, says getting a private contractor vetted and approved and its staff trained and put in place could take up to two years.\n\"The benefits are very marginal, and there's a huge cost and time associated with the transition,\" Evans says. \"We"}

It is her mum, however, who has been the biggest influence.\nVega\u2019s mother also passed on her interest in acting, which didn\u2019t blossom in her horse-mad daughter until she was 14. She had been riding since the age of four and competed in show-jumping right through her teenage years.

IBM, with its latest chip developments, is out in front.\nIn the past few years, researchers have succeeded repeatedly at making electronic components faster and more compact. In doing so, they have driven the worldwide growth of the technology sector.\nYet now, almost as if on cue to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the computer chip, the victory lap of the PC appears to be ending. Demand for PCs has stagnated, and new challenges stand before the semi-conductor industry.\nAccording to some analysts, the computers of the future are not the beige boxes that we have on our desktops today but rather chip- enabled products such as the Sony Playstation, digital television, or cell phones with Internet connections.\nIt is for these devices that the workers at IBM development centres in Boeblingen, Germany, are building new chips that must not only be quick but also multifunctional and, most importantly, energy efficient.\nThat's because for every improvement in chip speed, the energy requirements for a chip increase dramatically. The CMOS technology that IBM developed in the 1980s was important in being able to reduce energy requirements of chips at that time by 1,000 per cent. But energy requirements and associated heat problems are once again stumbling points for the chip manufacturers.\n\"Pentium processors are drawn on a surface that is hotter than an oven burner,\" reports Helmut Schettler, one of the two worldwide development managers at IBM. His observation is in line with a study at rival chipmaker Intel. Researchers are scrambling for a solution, but a revolutionary breakthrough like that offered by CMOS is not yet in sight, in Schettler's estimation.\nIBM and Japanese firms Sony and Toshiba went in together recently on a highly promising project. More than 400 million dollars have been invested by the three firms in the development of a \"supercomputer on a chip.\" This development is intended to place processors and memory on a single chip. The smallest components are 1,000 times thinner than a human hair.\nThe first implementation of this super chip will be in the next generation of Sony's Playstation. The idea of putting an entire computer on a chip would also work with cell phones. Three components would then be combined into one. \"This saves space, energy, and cost,\" says Schettler.\nIBM is known for its innovations in chip technology, although the American giant has in the past left the PC mass market to Intel and other rivals focusing only on supplying chips for its own super computers.\nFormer IBM chief Louis V. Gerstner began selling these central elements to other firms several years ago. In the so-called ASIC (application specific) chips, IBM's 12 per cent market share makes it the market leader. The decision to develop strengthened chips for the mobile end products of the future counts as one of the most important strategic changes of directions from Gerstner's time in office.\nIn IBM's Boeblinger laboratory, around 650 people are working on the smallest components of the computer cosmos - chip design is to some extent a matter of craftsmanship.\nThe current PC crisis is not a major issue. The compression of data for digital TV means major demand for these electronic brains of the future, but the Internet also demands better and better chips too, says Schettler.\n\"To speed the Internet up by ten times and to make it accessible"}

{"idx": "23555", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Nearly all the homeowners in the lower downtown neighborhood slated to receive a proposed mega-homeless shelter say they want the city utilities department to buy them out now, before their property values are further degraded by the planned shelter.\nThe 26 area residents made their feelings known in a petition handed to Colorado Springs Utilities' executive director, Phillip Tollefson, on Friday, Jan 21.\nThe city-owned energy enterprise is involved in the shelter proposal, because the $6 million homeless-services center will be built on part of the agency's Drake Power Plant complex on South Sierra Madre Street.\nIn exchange for providing land for the facility, the publicly owned power company had asked the consortium of non-profits that backed the shelter to help the utility department purchase homes in the area so that a long-desired rail line could be built through the neighborhood.\nLast week's petition could shorten that process considerably.\nMost residents interviewed said they didn't want to sell, but they felt they had little choice but to sign the petition. Even some who support the homeless-shelter plan, such as Alicia Garcia-Smith, say it would be better to go now before their homes lose more of their value.\n\"I'd like to continue living here, but if [the proposal for the rail spur and shelter] means that this is no longer going to be maintained as a neighborhood, then I'd rather go now,\" said Garcia-Smith, whose home on Conejos Street is directly across the road from the proposed shelter.\nGarcia-Smith's home is not directly in the path of the proposed railway. But because the rail spur, if built, would sandwich her and other residents on the block between a constant flow of coal trains, a homeless shelter, and a power plant, residents say the utilities should buy out all the residents in the affected, four-block area.\nIn addition to building the shelter, homeless agencies also plan to demolish four to six homes on Conejos Street to build a proposed day-care facility, which would serve shelter kids.\nTollefson said his agency would \"absolutely\" pursue the offer, adding that he's open to buying homes not directly in the rail line's path. \"We recognize that there are extenuating impacts beyond the strict right of way of the [rail spur],\" he said, noting that the new tracks might cut off neighborhood access by closing some streets to traffic.\nResidents say the prospect of the rail spur looming over the neighborhood, along with more immediate plans for the shelter and day-care facility, makes staying in the area too risky.\n\"If that spur is inevitable,\" Garcia-Smith continued, \"then when it's put in, we'd never be able to get enough money to move.\nThe new rail line would allow the utilities department to unload coal more cheaply at the Drake Power Plant. Because the rail spur would also connect the utilities with a second rail line, Tollefson said the rail line could save the agency up to $1 million a year.\nBecause the shelter will bring hundreds of homeless people to the area for daily meals and shelter, William Burke, the Baltic Street resident who initiated the petition, said residents should be relocated.\n\"They want to build a homeless shelter, a day-care center and a rail spur. I say, 'Fine, let them do it,' \" he said. \"But do it now. Move everybody out and give them a fair price so they can start over somewhere else.\""}

Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding in partnership with the Princeton University Muslim Life Program and Not in Our Town - Princeton.\nOrganizers aim to inspire teenagers teenagers and community members to become engaged in social justice work. The event will include a panel discussion, presentations from specific activists, and Q&A periods. Each activist will conduct workshops following the speaking portion of the event to groups of teenagers in order to really focus on how youth can mobilize to make a difference.\n\"We hope #TheGenerationofNow will have a profound effect on the Greater Princeton Area to not only be informed about the current reality, but be inspired to do something about it,\" says Ziad Ahmed, Founder and President of Redefy, Not in Our Town Board Member, and Princeton Day School Student. \"TheGenerationofNow can shape the conversation on racial justice in the Greater Princeton Area. So many people are largely uneducated about the current reality of our society, and oblivious to the civil rights movement that is occurring,\" says Ahmed. \"Our hope is that through bringing really exciting activists that we can inspire people, specifically teenagers, to care about social justice. My generation needs to be aware of the nuances in activism, whether it be within the Black Liberation Movement (Black Lives Matter Movement) or the general fight against racism. Procrastination has translated into many teenagers activism, faith, and lifestyle, and we hope this event can address that.\"\nConfirmed speakers are Donya Nasser, Zellie Imani, Goldie Taylor, Brittany Packnett, Haroon Moghul, Dani Laurence, Suey Park, and Essma Bengabsia. They will discuss not only why they've gotten involved in racial justice, but why it matters, and why it matters now. The organizers are extremely excited for this event, and hopeful it can have a great impact. They are also still in discussion with other potential speakers, performers, and distinguished guests as they look to make the event as successful as possible.\n#TheGenerationOfNow will be held in commemoration of International Human Rights Day, and the event will be open to the public as #TheGenerationOfNow seeks to promote awareness to as may people as possible.

{"idx": "23571", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: (iStock) Many parents struggle with exactly how much screen time is okay for their kids. Is a half-hour show okay but a full-length movie bad? How much gaming should you allow when your kid also uses his computer for homework? Does Wikipedia count as reading? And when does a passion for, say, video games become problematic? The truth is, there is no magic formula. And just as every family differs in what they eat, when they eat and what they like, a healthy media diet is different for every family. The key is making sure that the things that are important to your family are fairly balanced over the long term. A healthy media diet balances activities (games, social media, TV), time (Fifteen minutes? Three hours?) and choices (YouTube, Minecraft, \u201cStar Wars\u201d) with offline activities (sports, face-to-face conversations, daydreaming). At some point, kids will be able to manage their own media diets. In the meantime, these tips can help set them up for success. 1. Find balance. Instead of counting daily screen-time minutes, aim for a balance throughout the week. Get your kids to help plan a week that includes stuff they have to do and stuff they like to do, such as schoolwork, activities, chores, reading, family time, and TV or gaming. Decide on limits and behavior using a Family Media Agreement. 2. Walk the walk. Put your devices away while driving, at mealtimes and during important conversations. Kids will learn habits from you. 3. Talk about it. Ask questions about kids\u2019 favorite games, shows and characters. Discuss ideas and issues they read about or learn about through a TV show or a game. This is an opportunity for bonding, learning, and sharing your values. 4. Create tech-free zones. Set rules that fit your family, such as \u201cno devices during dinner,\u201d \u201cno social media during homework\u201d or \u201call screens off before bedtime.\u201d 5. Check ratings.

The company is bringing Android, its mobile operating system, to televisions and cars.\n\"So, this isn't a new platform. That's kind of the point,\" Android's engineering director, Dave Burke, told an audience of programmers at the Google I/O conference. \"We're simply giving TV the same level of attention as phones and tablets have traditionally enjoyed. We want you to be able to leverage your existing skills and investment in Android and extend them to TV.\"\nWhat this means for an average person is that the people building apps for phones will soon be building apps for all kinds of stuff.\nThe design frameworks and types of interactions that you have on the device in your pocket are going to proliferate all around you. When you're in your car, Google wants the Android design language to sit in the dashboard. When you look at your watch: Android. When you turn on the TV: Android.\nThe spread of Android matters because operating systems are not a neutral way of accessing computing power. They structure all the interactions that we have with our phones. They change what applications are possible. They set standards for security and accessibility. They smuggle in a way of thinking about accessing information and communications.\nIf Android is to be the core of your own personal swarm of screens and robots, it means that all of the data Google knows about you will come to the interactions you have with the stuff around you. The profile you build up at your computer and on your tablet will now apply to your television watching and your commuting, seamlessly (as Google likes to say).\nSitting underneath all the interactions you have across these devices, Google's algorithms will be churning. The way Google thinks\u2014its habits of data collection, analysis, and optimization\u2014will become part of these experiences that have previously remained outside the company's reach.\nGoogle recently purchased a slate of robotics companies, home-sensor maker Nest, and the surveillance-camera startup Dropcam. Many have read these moves as Google's push into physical space.\nWell, the effort to put Android everywhere is the other pincer in Google's maneuver. The acquisitions focus on novel hardware devices, while the Android team attempts to make Googleyness ubiquitous on screens.\nHow might this shape the future?\nWell, another announcement Google made in describing the upcoming version of Android was to talk about optimizing the notifications that show up on the lock screen of phones. As Wired's Mat Honan has noted, \"Notifications are the new interface frontier.\" Notifications are one reason WhatsApp was able to make such rapid user gains: A message popping up from WhatsApp was functionally equivalent to a text or a Facebook message. If companies can get people to opt-in to their notifications, it is even better than being on the \"homescreen\" of the phone.\nWhich brings us back to Google's announcement that they will be determining \"the most important\" notifications to show you. Like Facebook's News Feed or Gmail's Priority Inbox, you'll see a selection of possible notifications, rather than all of them, when you glance at the phone. (A tap lets you see all of them.)

{"idx": "23574", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: After waiting for nearly 20 minutes last night, I gave up trying to find a match of Tiny Racers. The mode, which recreates the feeling of driving RC cars, was added to GTA Online last year. Nobody plays it anymore. Actually, nobody seems to play most GTA Online modes. It's becoming a problem.\nGTA Online just had its most active month ever. It is consistently one of the top-selling games on Steam, Xbox and Playstation. It is always in the top 10 of the best selling games each year. The community is huge. Yet players looking to play a wide variety of modes modes will have trouble finding anybody to play with or against.\nThe problem, paradoxically enough, is an overabundance of content. GTA Online has a huge variety of things to do, including missions, races, heists, and deathmatches. When the game first launched, this variety was great. But the game has only gotten bigger.\nNow, after four years and dozens of updates, GTA Online almost feels too big and empty. The player base has spread out across too many jobs and events, making it hard to play anything but the latest new thing.\nThis list doesn't include biker activities, CEO missions, heists, public events, user-made races and Rockstar-verified jobs and tracks. Even without these added activities, you can see the list of things to do in GTA Online is massive. The problem is that most players tend to stick to the new stuff, which allows the bulk of GTA Online content to become ghost towns. The vast majority of older modes are empty, making it nearly impossible to find a match without waiting 30 minutes or longer.\nIt doesn't help that getting people to play with you is a convoluted process. Usually, I pick a newer game mode, because people are likely to want to play it. I host the lobby, make it open, and turn on \"auto invite,\" which constantly sends invites to players across different sessions and lobbies.\nWhen another player joins, a timer starts. Once that timer hits 0, the match starts. This is crappy, because it will often lead to matches starting with only 2 or 3 players. So, I end up having to toggle the lobby between open and closed to reset the timer, crossing my fingers that other players will somehow fill up the roster.\nI've been playing GTA Online for so long that this whole process is just normal now. I barely even think about it, unless we are having bad luck and still can't find players. That's when my friends and I start performing rituals in the hopes they will increase our luck in finding other people to play with.\nWe'll switch the lobby between open and closed really quickly, or change the radio station in the menu. These things don't actually help, of course, but it's better than just sitting there doing nothing. For new modes, I usually don't have to wait long, but for anything more than a few months old, I can wait for an hour and not find anyone to play with.\nThe thing is, even after all of that waiting time, finding players doesn't fix the issue. People tend to leave after a few matches, and soon you're back to waiting. Depending on the mode, there are nights where I probably spend more time looking for a match than playing.\nActually, you might spend a long time watching clouds go by while filling up lobbies, too. This is gripe players are always talking about on sites GTAforums, Reddit, the Steam forums and elsewhere.\nGTA Online is a hugely complex game and I'm not a game developer or anything,"}

At $31 a share, Yahoo believes the bid undervalues the company, two sources said.\nA second source close to Yahoo said it had received a procession of preliminary contacts by media, technology, telephone and financial companies. But the source said they were unaware whether any alternative bid was in the offing.\nIn a memo to Yahoo employees on Friday, Yahoo leaders wrote: \"We want to emphasize that absolutely no decisions have been made -- and, despite what some people have tried to suggest, there's certainly no integration process underway.\"\nFew natural bidders exist beside Google that could engage in a bidding war, and Google would be unlikely to win approval from antitrust regulators, some Wall Street analysts said on Friday.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday that Google's chief executive Eric Schmidt called Yahoo's chief executive Jerry Yang to offer his company's help in any effort to thwart Microsoft's bid.\nSpokesmen for Yahoo and Google declined comment. Google was not immediately available for comment on the Journal story.\nYahoo's efforts to find an alternative bidder could simply be a measure to pressure Microsoft to boost its bid, which valued Yahoo at $44.6 billion when first announced on Friday.\nSanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a research note that \"the Microsoft bid of $31 is very astute\" because it puts pressure on Yahoo management to take actions that could unlock the underlying value of Yahoo assets, which he estimates are worth upward of $39-$45 a share.\nSeparately, Google fired back on Sunday at Microsoft's bid to acquire Yahoo Inc, accusing Microsoft of seeking to extend its computer software monopoly deeper into the Internet realm.\nDavid Drummond, a Google senior vice president and its chief legal officer, said in a blog post that the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo could undermine competition on the Web and called on policy makers to challenge the combination.\nMicrosoft responded to Google's arguments by saying that a merger with Yahoo would create a \"compelling number two competitor for Internet search and online advertising\" to market leader Google.\n\"The alternative scenarios only lead to less competition on the Internet,\" Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement.\nDrummond argued that Microsoft's power stems from decades- old monopolies in Windows -- the software operating system used to control most personal computers -- and Internet Explorer, which is the dominant browser consumers used to view the Web.\nMicrosoft's proposed merger with Yahoo would combine the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers of Web-based e-mail, instant messaging (IM) and portals, which act as starting points for hundreds of millions of users seeking information on the Web.\nThe Google executive argued in an official blog post that Microsoft could be looking to favor Microsoft and Yahoo services by pushing customers to other Web services they own instead of letting customers elect to use rival services.\n\"Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to"}

Joining us to discuss the political reaction here, as well as other political news of the week, is Senior Washington Correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, good morning.\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Melissa.\nBLOCK: Let's talk about the long, hate-filled document that suspected shooter issued. He - in that document, he mentions President Trump. He also writes about the Second Amendment. He talks about stirring discord, instigating a potential civil war in the U.S. over gun control. What has President Trump said in response?\nELVING: ...In a news conference about the U.S. Southern border. At that time, the president was asked if he had any concerns about rising white nationalism. And he said this.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps, that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet. They're just learning about the person and the people involved. But it's certainly a terrible thing.\nELVING: Now, the White House says linking the president to the suspect in any way is outrageous. Still, it is a reminder that the political dialogue here reverberates beyond our own shores.\nBLOCK: Ron, let's turn to Congress now, which issued a couple of rebukes of President Trump this week. The Senate rejected his national emergency declaration at the southwestern border, leading to President Trump's first veto. And we saw a dozen Senate Republicans defying Trump on that issue - more than expected, I believe.\nELVING: That is true, although, perhaps, not as many as it would take to have a veto override. But we'll get to that in a moment. There's disagreement on the first point about a national emergency. The president continues to say both that the wall is already being built and that the need for more wall is a matter of national security that supersedes the Congress and its constitutional power of the purse. So the facts on all that, of course, are very much in dispute. What is not disputed is the enormous importance the president has placed on the wall as a focus of his presidency. That's the political emergency. So now the House will vote on an override in 10 days. But unless there are a lot more Republicans coming on board than there were initially, that override will fail. Then it's up to the federal court system - ultimately, the Supreme Court - which will determine whether Trump is exceeding his authority under the Constitution.\nBLOCK: And finally, Ron, this week, we also saw the Senate joining the House in voting to cut off U.S. aid to the Saudi-backed war in Yemen. The House also voted 420-0 on a resolution urging that the Mueller report be made public in full.\nELVING: Yes. The president is expected to veto that Yemen cutoff. So that will be the second veto of his presidency. Here, again, there were more Senate Republicans deserting him than ever before but still not"}

Tax reform contributed 5% to that expected gain.\nGoldman Sachs analysts have the loftiest expectations for the energy sector, with expectations of a 75% increase, with the big jump in crude oil prices adding to the upside. They are also especially optimistic on information technology (expecting 23% growth) and banks and other financial companies (22%).\nThese high expectations come as markets have been on a wild ride, with threats of a trade war sending the major U.S. equities reeling. Following trade war-inspired losses, the major U.S. stock indexes have fallen into negative territory for the year.\nIf first-quarter earnings are disappointing, earnings results could cause steeper losses, but if earnings meet or exceed expectations don\u2019t look for a massive stock market rally, Goldman Sachs said.\nPositive 1Q surprises would confirm investors\u2019 existing confidence in corporate fundamentals. However, if 1Q results disappoint, fears about decelerating economic activity will compound mounting concerns around trade, regulation and stretched positioning.\nIn its preview of the first-quarter earnings season, Goldman Sachs acknowledges some of the major conversations they have been having with clients, and they include the following considerations.\nWhile reported EPS is expected to show 17% growth, EPS growth excluding tax reform would be roughly 9% this quarter.\nTax reform will provide the largest boost to previously high-tax rate sectors such as telecom services and consumer discretionary.\nTrade tensions represent a minimal risk to S&P 500 earnings.\nInvestors remain focused on regulatory risks following Facebook\u2019s data privacy debacle.

Whether you use it daily or occasionally, many of you probably have one model or another sitting around the house. Even though GoPro\u2019s point-and-shoot simplicity makes it easy to use, there are plenty of extra tricks you can learn to take your filmmaking to the next level.\nIf your helmet is blocking 90 percent of your GoPro\u2019s field of view, you\u2019ll want to know about it as early as possible, not after you\u2019ve been out kayaking for five hours. If you\u2019re using a GoPro without a built-in LED display, then do a short test run and review it.\nIf you\u2019re using a camera without an integrated screen, then the GoPro apps for Android and iOS can be a huge help, enabling you to preview the field of view and direction of the camera before filming starts. Instructions for connecting phone to camera are available inside the app.\nGoPros are known for their wide-angle lenses, but a 170-degree field of view (FOV) isn\u2019t the right perspective every time. Some models give you a choice of FOV at certain resolutions, so there\u2019s the option of switching to medium (127 degrees) or narrow (90 degrees) if needed.\nYou don\u2019t need to be an Oscar-winning movie director to understand the basics of FOV and how a narrower setting can give you a more focussed look at the action, almost like zooming in. The FOV option is on the main video settings screen on the GoPro itself, and if you own a new HERO5 Black model then the linear photo mode lets you eliminate the fish-eye distortion completely.\nGoPros are known primarily for being video cameras, but don\u2019t discount their capabilities as stills cameras either. No matter what model you\u2019re using, you should find a variety of still camera modes capable of impressive shots.\nSwapping between video and photo modes is a fiddly process, but if you want to extract still images from a video, you can do this right inside the mobile apps for Android and iOS or in Quik on the desktop. Open a media file then tap the Grab Photo icon (far right) to browse frame by frame.\nThe high-end Hero 5, Hero4 and Hero3 cameras have an extra feature built into them called Protune, and if you know what you\u2019re doing with it, it can be a really effective tool. It essentially lets you adjust ISO speeds, white balance, exposure levels and more.\nIt can be activated in the camera settings on the device (under Capture Settings), but by default gives a grainy, washed out look. It\u2019s intended to give professional filmmakers more of a \u2018blank slate\u2019 to work with, so research the settings and know how to use them first.\nYou\u2019ll probably only share a fraction of your footage with others, and to help you mark the best bits, there\u2019s a \u201cHiLights\u201d tagging system you can set in the Studio app, the mobile apps, on the smart remote and on the Hero 5, Hero4, Hero 4 Session and Hero+ LCD cameras.\nIf you do the tagging on the cameras or the remotes, the highlights are automatically marked when you import the footage into GoPro\u2019s official desktop app, making it easier to jump to the best parts of your videos and combine everything into a shareable whole.\nYour GoPro comes with a very capable time lapse mode, which gives you an alternative way of shooting numerous scenes, whether it\u2019s a sports game or a city street.

{"idx": "23602", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Fidel Castro\u2019s legacy brought hope for Cuba, so what happens now?\nReactions to Fidel Castro's death at age 90 strike a depressingly familiar tone. Some celebrate while others mourn. These two responses may not be evenly divided in the U.S., but they certainly would be if we polled the hemisphere.\nCastro's passing dramatizes what we have known for some time: Cuba stands at the brink of change, now apt to accelerate and, with a Donald Trump administration to the north, will quite likely be disastrous. The tsunami of predatory capitalism poised to hit the island will be impossible to stop and difficult for the state to control or redirect.\nAlthough these changes will enrich some \u2014 and already have disproportionately benefited those with close ties to the ruling party \u2014 they are sure to keep the majority impoverished, producing the same patterns of stubborn economic inequality that afflict Cuba's neighbors, both north and south.\nIn a visit to Cuba last December, I did see evidence of resiliency in areas for which supporters of the Cuban Revolution are justifiably proud: population health statistics that are similar to those of the U.S.; ingenious strategies for economic self-sufficiency (such as agro-ecology); an astounding reach of free, public education with rich and diverse communities of expert knowledge that put wealthier nations to shame; stalwart national pride in the face of great adversity.\nThe tsunami of predatory capitalism poised to hit the island will be impossible to stop and difficult for the state to control or redirect.\nYet, all these achievements are vulnerable, and the tsunami of predatory capitalism promises further erosion.\nThe Cuban model, at least as it has played out in dialectic with outright hostility from one U.S. administration after another, neither merits vigorous defense nor inspires unqualified admiration. Despite claims to have achieved racial equality, and despite substantive improvements during the first two decades of the revolution, today Afro-Cubans still face deep structural racism that has worsened with economic woes.\nExciting ideals of participatory democracy, meant to go beyond electoral politics to democratize all realms of society, have given way to authoritarian practices and newly created hierarchies. Rigid political control makes for a poor fit with market-oriented reforms, yielding irrationalities and dysfunctionalities that are both frustrating and unjust. Even supporters of the government with whom I spoke last December seemed fed up and ready for change.\nBut although it is hard to defend the \"Cuban model\" as such, the deeper legacy of the revolution does merit our affirmation. Castro and those of the movement he led were driven by the revolutionary idea that poverty, racism, political repression and abject dependency on the U.S. could be defeated, opening the way to build a society grounded in the values of equality, social welfare and self-determination.\nWe can and should criticize the many shortcomings and contradictions in the results of these efforts, but I for one heartily affirm Castro's legacy of audacious hope and willingness to fight for a noble cause. In the face of our own society's descent into polarization, racial hatred, environmental destruction and deepened fears about the future, this image keeps me from despair: a new generation of young leaders similar to Castro who will forge their own utopian convictions that a different and better society is possible and who will act against all odds to realize their ideals.\nCharles Hale holds a joint appointment as a professor in"}

Jacobson, leader of the university's Atmosphere and Energy program and a professor of civil and environmental engineering.\nIn a report to be published Thursday in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Jacobson noted that soot particles - both black and brown carbon - come not only from burning fossil fuels in industry and transportation, but also from the immense quantities of wood and dung that are burned for heating and cooking throughout the developing world.\nThose factors combined make black and brown carbon in soot an even more powerful contributor to global warming than industrial emissions of methane, which until now have been considered the second most important cause of climate change, Jacobson said.\nAnd because soot absorbs sunlight as it falls on ice and snow and radiates back to Earth from clouds and layers of the atmosphere, it is the major reason for rapidly melting sea ice in the Arctic region, he said.\nControlling soot may be the only way to significantly slow Arctic warming over the next two decades, Jacobson said.\n\"We have to start taking its effects into account in planning mitigation efforts, and the sooner we start making changes, the better,\" he said.\nUsing a sophisticated computer model he developed over 20 years, Jacobson also studied mortality figures from the World Health Organization and epidemiological reports from American health agencies. He said he found that soot emissions account for at least 1.5 million premature deaths each year around the world and lead to respiratory illness, heart disease and asthma - mostly in the developing world where wood and animal dung are used for heating and cooking.\nJames Hansen, a leading climate expert at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and an outspoken advocate of strong political action to combat global warming, agrees that soot is a major factor in the rapid melting of Arctic sea ice.\nIn an e-mail to The Chronicle, Hansen referred to soot particles as \"dirty aerosols,\" saying that the melting of ice in the Arctic and worldwide is \"usually attributed solely to global warming,\" and that the role of soot has not been adequately acknowledged.\n\"Saving Arctic sea ice will require the combination of slowing carbon dioxide emissions and keeping the Arctic pristine via controls on dirty aerosol emissions,\" Hansen said.\nControlling the soot created by burning fossil fuels, like oil and coal, and from burning wood and dung \"may help to reduce Arctic ice loss and global warming faster than any other control option available,\" Jacobson concluded."}

Published on January 11, 2019.\nBarbara Gardner Proctor, a trailblazing Chicago businesswoman who brought the Beatles' music to America\u2014literally\u2014as a Vee-Jay Records executive, has died at 85, according to her son, Morgan.\nHe said she died Dec. 19 at Chicago's Fairmont Care Center after falling and injuring her hip, adding, \"She was in the throes of dementia.\"\nProctor was best known as the founder, in 1970, of the first ad agency owned by an African-American woman. She borrowed $1,000 from a friend in the Count Basie Band and rented space above Pizzeria Uno. Her billings grew into the millions as she labored to land Jewel Food Stores and then Kraft and other mass-market consumer companies as clients.\nIn 1983 she was featured on \"60 Minutes.\" The next year, Ronald Reagan cited her in his State of the Union address as a \"spirit of America\" who \"rose from a ghetto shack to build a multi-million-dollar advertising agency in Chicago.\" The Washington Post described her East Wacker Drive offices as \"glitzy plush.\"\nBut as established advertising firms slowly warmed to the black consumer and other African-Americans started competing firms, Proctor's business declined, and her dream of creating another Leo Burnett died. Her firm dissolved in 1995.\n\"It is not, in any way, easy to be a minority company, and as I am a woman and black, it has been a double minority situation,\" she told the Tribune five years earlier. She named her firm Proctor & Gardner Advertising, to give the impression of a white male behind the curtains. (A resemblance to Procter & Gamble didn't hurt.) It would take seven more years before a black female became a major ad agency vice president.\nJudy Foster Davis, author of \"Pioneering African-American Women in the Advertising Business: Biographies of Mad Black Women,\" calls Proctor a hidden figure of the ad industry. \"She didn't just see advertising as a business enterprise. She saw it for its ability to lead social change,\" Davis told Crain's.\nProctor's story was every bit the tale that Reagan made it out to be.\nBorn to an unmarried 16-year-old in North Carolina, she was raised by grandparents in a dirt-floor shack with no running water or electricity. She got a teacher's certificate from Talladega College in Alabama and was headed to back home after serving as a camp counselor in Kalamazoo, Mich. First, she detoured to Chicago buy clothes for her teaching assignment.\n\"I wound up spending all of my money and didn't have bus fare to get home. And in large measure, for 30 years I've been trying to get my bus fare back to North Carolina,\" she told the Tribune in 1990. She volunteered at the Chicago Urban League, which surprised her with a paycheck, and became a jazz critic for Down Beat magazine.\nAs international director of black-owned Vee-Jay in the early 1960s, she traveled to Europe four times a year \"when black people were hardly flying in airplanes,\" Davis says, to swap records with other recording companies.

In other cases, HPV prompts cell changes that can gradually put women at greater risk of cervical cancer.\nA significant drop in abnormal Pap test results happened after girls and women were given the vaccine named Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer, according to a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).\nWhile the findings are not definitive that Gardasil prevents cancer, they do signal the vaccine will spare thousands of women a diagnosis of cell abnormality or malignant changes that may lead to more tests and possibly surgery, said Warner Huh, M.D., associate professor in the UAB Division of Gynecologic Oncology and the doctor chosen to present the data.\nIn testing Gardasil reduced abnormal Pap test results by 43 percent compared to women not given the vaccine. The 43 percent reduction was for tests that found pre-cancerous changes called high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) more than three years after women were given the vaccine.\nGardasil reduced other abnormal Pap results, including milder pre-malignant cell changes, by 16 to 35 percent compared to women not given the vaccine.\nThe results are a compilation of three separate trials involving more than 18,000 women, ages 16 to 26, in the United States, Europe and Asia. All test subjects had normal Pap smear readings at the start of the trial.\nIn addition to the drop in unwanted Pap results, the study found invasive procedures like cervical biopsies were performed up to 42 percent less in Gardasil recipients compared to women not given the vaccine, Huh said.\nGardasil is approved to fight the human papilloma virus (HPV) strains believed to cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and more than 90 percent of genital warts.\nThe findings were presented March 10 at the annual meeting of the Society of Gynecological Oncologists held in Tampa."}

Forget Katniss Everdeen and Harry Potter, it\u2019s about time audiences became reacquainted with the likes of Captain Nemo and his iconic Nautilus. Luckily for fans of Jules Verne\u2019s novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, we will soon see the legendary story once again brought to life on the silver screen.\nA new report from Deadline indicates that Disney has set their sights on a film adaptation of Jules Verne\u2019s classic novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. An origin story called Captain Nemo, the project remained stuck in development hell for some time under director David Fincher, who eventually dropped out in order to make Gone Girl. However, the project has gained new momentum by enlisting the directing talents of James Mangold, who will take on the project sometime after his completion of Wolverine 3.\nIt\u2019s difficult news for us to digest because characters from classic literature have had hit and miss experiences in cinema recently. While modern young adult franchises have been adapted with incredible success, like The Hunger Games, older and more iconic properties \u2013 many of which paved the way for today\u2019s popular genre work \u2013 have experienced less than stellar results, despite major financial investments from studios. We only need to look at the absolute travesty that was John Carter to know that an adaptation of classic literature doesn\u2019t always mean that a project will become a smash hit.\nThe truly odd aspect of this story stems from the fact that there are actually two films inspired by 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea currently in development. Bryan Singer has been incredibly vocal about his enthusiasm for such a project, and currently has plans to bring his own version of Captain Nemo and the Nautilus to the silver screen for 20th Century Fox some time after he has completed all of his work on the upcoming X-Men: Apocalypse.\nHowever, as James Mangold\u2019s version of the story will reportedly revolve more around an origin story than Bryan Singer's vision, we could very well see both stories hit theaters within similar time frames. We know for a fact that there\u2019s also a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen reboot currently in development, so it seems entirely plausible that we could soon see characters like Captain Nemo headlining a brand new type of cinematic universe.\nWe will bring you more information related to the upcoming adaptation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea as it becomes available to us. The story is an absolute classic, and we\u2019re hoping that it leads to a renaissance of great films based upon beloved characters and storylines from legendary literary works."}

Where does he get that figure? Well, he looks at what its corporate owner, Advance Publications, the same company that owns The New Yorker, Vogue, and Vanity Fair, think it's worth.\nAdvance has recapitalized Reddit, taking the site out of its Conde Nast division and allowing Reddit employees to own a sizable minority of newly issued stock. As part of that recapitalization Advance bought $20 million of convertible preferred stock in Reddit and put in provisions saying that if Reddit is ever sold for less than $240 million, the conversion terms will be rejiggered so that Advance comes away with a bigger slice of Reddit and employees get less.\nThose calculations imply that Reddit is already on track to be worth at least $240 million.\nAdvance, which bought Reddit in 2006 for an undisclosed amount that is thought to be $5 million or less, spun the company off as a standalone operation about a year ago. Those figures above are from filings related to that move. Considering About.com, a site with less cache but more unique visitors, was scooped up by IAC's Barry Diller for $300 million in August, that figure fits. However, not even Anders is too sure about that number.\nNone of this is confirmed and there are other ways to calculate the value of the company, which Anders does. He also gives us the market value per user, \"a method often used by venture capitalists and stock pickers,\" which brings in the most optimistic number. Reddit gets 43 million unique visitors a month, he says. We're not sure where he got that number, but we found a 34 million unique visitor number from a January 2012 Reddit blog post. Off of his number, however, Angers calculates: \"Google is currently priced at about $220 per search user. Facebook is more like $50. Yelp is at $17, Pinterest $30. Reddit counts 43 million unique users a month. On that basis, a Yelp-like valuation would put Reddit at more than $700 million.\" Let's say we were using the 34 million person number, that would still put it up around $578 million.\nThen again, there is actual revenue at Google, and not so much at Reddit, according to Anders. He calls the current revenue \"skimpy\" and notes that it has so far not turned a profit. Looking around it's hard to find hard numbers to confirm these assertions. But all signs point to low revenue and possibly no profits. In 2010 (after the Advance buyout) the company asked users for money because \"Reddit\u2019s revenue isn\u2019t great,\" read a note on the site. Like all Internet websites, it relies on ads to make money, many of which come from small businesses and the \"occasional big brand such as Autodesk,\" writes Anders. For now, advertisers like the social network because of its big addicted audience. But that is a precarious way to make money. Look what happened to Digg. Other than that, the site also has a program called Reddit Gold, which offers extended features for $3.99/month. We couldn'"}

An even larger percentage, 37%, said they'll never retire and plan to either work until they get too sick or die, the survey found.\nDriving these concerns is that many of the respondents said they simply can't afford to pay their monthly bills and save for retirement at the same time.\n\"For the past three years, the struggle to pay bills is a growing concern and the prospect of saving for retirement looks dim, particularly for those in their prime saving years,\" Laurie Nordquist, head of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, said in a statement.\nThe concerns come as many middle-class families are trying to make do with less. The country's median annual household income is down by more than 8% since 2007. And many of the jobs lost during the recent recession have been replaced with lower wage positions.\nWith minimal savings built up, a third of those surveyed said Social Security will be their primary source of income during retirement. Of those making less than $50,000, nearly half said they will rely mainly on Social Security.\nIn August, the average Social Security recipient received around $15,000 a year in retirement benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.\nAnother factor holding back middle-class savers is a fear of investing in the stock market, said Nordquist.\nAcross workers of all ages, only 24% said they were confident in the stock market as a place to invest for retirement. And slightly more than half said they don't invest in the stocks because they are afraid to lose their savings in the ups and downs of the market.\nThis is despite the fact that financial planners say that investing in stocks is the best way to grow a nest egg that will be large enough to cover decades of retirement. Over years of savings, short-term losses are overtaken by the long-term gains that years of compounded returns offer.\n\"There is a striking amount of fear about the stock market among all investors,\" she said. \"The middle class just isn't making the link between being invested and the potential growth of their savings."}

{"idx": "23627", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Chris Paul denied the Los Angeles Clippers' three-year extension offer Saturday night, according to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times.\nNaturally, this leads to heavy speculation concerning the All-Star point guard's future. Frank Isola, New York Daily News' Knicks beat writer, shed some light on the situation at hand.\nThis isn't a new idea. Before Paul was sent from the New Orleans Hornets to the Clippers, the Knicks were believed to be his destination of choice. When Paul denied the Clippers' three-year, $60 million extension offer on Saturday, the Knicks became an obvious, if unrealistic, candidate. It's probably safe to assume that Paul rejected the extension in pursuit of a maximum contract after next season, but his interest in the Knicks hasn't ceased for a reason.\nAs Isola notes, this isn't going to happen this summer. The Knicks owe Tyson Chandler, Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire approximately $57 million in the 2013-14 season.\nThe Knicks would have to shed one of these two major contracts if they want to bring Paul to New York, and that''s what they should do.\nStoudemire is frequently injured and has lost a lot of the explosiveness that made him an All-Star early in his career. Anthony is a defensive waste and a ball-stopper on offense.\nThe Knicks' brass would be smart to add Paul, who is arguably the NBA's best point guard. He would thrive playing next to either Stoudemire or Anthony, and he would make the other Knicks exponentially better.\nI think it's pretty obvious the Knicks need a shot in the arm. Anthony and Stoudemire have too much of a \"me-first\" mentality, and Paul has already proven he can revive a beleaguered franchise. He's a leader, and he knows how to play in front of a major media market.\nThis could just be hearsay. Rumors generate false buzz every day, but given Paul's prior interest, you have to believe it's a possibility.\nThe Knicks have talented players, but they lack a leader. They need a player who puts winning ahead of everything else, and Paul does exactly that each and every night. He plays hard on both ends of the floor and isn't afraid to do the \"dirty work\" to grab a victory. That's something that New York's current headliners (Anthony and Stoudemire) haven't come close to proving.\nPaul is in a solid situation with the Clippers, but who can blame him for liking New York? It's the mecca of all media markets, and star players in any sport have always migrated there.\nIsola's NBA executives may be wrong, but this will be a major storyline until Paul signs on the dotted line."}

{"idx": "23640", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As Malawi celebrates the International Day of the Girl today, will President Peter wa Mutharika do what it takes to better the lives of the country\u2019s girls and women?\nIn his inaugural speech in June, Malawi\u2019s newly elected fifth president set out his vision to rebuild the country both economically and as a progressive democracy. Notably, there was little mention of promoting gender equality in a country that is ranked a dismal 174 out of 187 countries in the 2014 UN Gender Inequality Index.\nIn Malawi, more women than men are poor. Most women are employed in the country\u2019s important agricultural sector, but they earn only 78 percent of what their male counterparts earn. There are fewer women than men in non-agriculture jobs, and more men than women are literate. The country has high rates of death from childbirth, representing about 16 percent of all deaths of women aged 15-49, according to government data. Violence against women is widespread.\nImbedded in these disparities is Malawi\u2019s shockingly high rate of child marriage \u2013 one of the highest globally. One out of two girls in the country will be married by her 18th birthday, according to the United Nations.\nDuring his June \u201cstate of the nation address,\u201d President Mutharika said that his \u201cgovernment is committed to gender parity, women empowerment and upholding of women\u2019s rights as a prerequisite to poverty reduction and sustainable development.\u201d However, an analysis of Mutharika\u2019s first 100 days in office by the Center for Human Rights and Rehabilitation \u2013 a leading Malawian nongovernmental organization \u2013 and the Center for Development of People notes that the government seems to have abandoned the gender equality agenda.\nThe good news is that Mutharika\u2019s government still has an opportunity to empower women, and promote equality. Importantly, it can take concrete measures to end child marriage, which curtails girls\u2019 education, and makes them more likely to die from childbirth and face violence in their marriages. Just today, a Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kailash Satyarthi, a child rights activist from India who has campaigned against child marriage.\nMutharika\u2019s government should enact the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Bill, a comprehensive family law proposed in 2006 that would protect against child and forced marriage and make 18 the minimum marriage age. The move would support Malawi\u2019s economic and social development, and it could convince Malawian women that his government is genuinely committed to their equality and empowerment."}

When Wilson-Raybould saw her mother, Sandy Wilson could tell her daughter needed a break.\nThat didn\u2019t stop Wilson-Raybould, the MP for Vancouver Granville, from launching into her annual Christmas baking marathon. She spent hours making enough sugar cookies, the salty snack known as nuts and bolts and other treats for about 30 neighbours on We Wai Kai First Nation, where she is a local celebrity. When she arrives in this little Quadra Island community of 150 people, word gets around; when she goes out, everyone wants to stop and chat with the country\u2019s first Indigenous attorney general and minister of justice.\nWhen Wilson-Raybould finished making the Christmas treats, stuffing gift bags with baked goods and writing out cards, Sandy offered to take over.\nWhat Sandy didn\u2019t know, and the attorney general of Canada couldn\u2019t tell her, was that Wilson-Raybould\u2019s job had become a pressure cooker that was about to explode. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Privy Council Office and minister of finance\u2019s office had been suggesting, cajoling and even making veiled threats to convince her to help Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin avoid going to court on fraud and corruption charges, according to Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony before the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27.\nWhen Trudeau\u2019s former chief of staff Gerald Butts took the stand before the justice committee on March 6, the country heard how the prime minister offered Wilson-Raybould the Indigenous services portfolio, but she turned it down. \u201cShe said she had spent her life opposed to the Indian Act, and couldn\u2019t be in charge of the programs administered under its authority,\u201d according to Butts.\nAccording to Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony, she took that last call \u201cat home, alone\u201d in Ottawa on Dec. 19. \u201cI was determined to end all interference and conversations about this matter, once and for all,\u201d she said about the \u201clengthy\u201d conversation.\nSo when she landed in Cape Mudge a few days later, Wilson-Raybould was ready for a break from the SNC-Lavalin file and ready to get to her baking. The cabinet shuffle, her resignation as veterans affairs minister and her testimony were all in the future, as was the resignation of MP Jane Philpott, Wilson-Raybould\u2019s closest cabinet ally.\nFriends and family had no idea what was going on, but by Feb. 27, 2019, most of them were captivated by news of her testimony before the justice committee. Although thousands in the corridors of power were riveted by the news, those on Vancouver Island who knew Wilson-Raybould before she became a politician were seeing the saga play out through a more personal lens.\nWilson-Raybould looked resolute during her explosive testimony, but Comox high school teacher and longtime family friend Tim McKinnon could tell she was rattled as he watched. The chin quiver gave it away; he had seen that telltale sign before.\nThat was the first time he noticed the way her mouth would form a line and her chin quivered when she was upset. But Wilson-Raybould always stood up for herself, no matter the consequences.\n\u201cThere was a point where she said, \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m not doing that anymore"}

Dianne Feinstein in the wake of ongoing Republican conspiracy theories about what Simpson did or did not tell the Senate.\nSomehow, GOP critics of the Trump-Russia investigation have tried to put a positive spin on these materials, as if Simpson\u2019s answers prove their point that the whole business is a witch hunt.\nIn fact, there are only two ways to read the Simpson interview: either it says nothing, or it has blown up months of carefully constructed conspiracy theorizing.\nMore: Where is the GOP outrage as Trump turns America into a banana republic?\nLet\u2019s start by piecing together, as best we can, what various critics of the investigation, including the most vociferous Trump supporters, think is going on.\nBy now we\u2019re all familiar with the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d a raw \u2014 in every way \u2014 report from a British spy who was engaged by an opposition research firm called Fusion GPS. It makes sensational claims about years of Russian operations against President Donald Trump.\nIf not for Steele\u2019s file, the GOP reasoning goes, the FBI would never have started down the path of investigating Trump, which would never have led to FBI Director James Comey approaching Trump about the file; absent this, Comey would never have been fired, there would be no Mueller probe, and all would be right with the world.\nBut what about Trump officials meeting with the Russians during the campaign? Indeed, in the telling of at least some Trump defenders, these were the result of orders issued from Clinton\u2019s volcano lair for Fusion to lure Donald Trump Jr. and others into a room with shady Russians for meetings that were unwise \u2014 or even \u201ctreasonous,\u201d if banished Trump advisor Steve Bannon is to be believed. Somehow, after all this slick tradecraft, Clinton\u2019s people never saw it coming when the Russians betrayed them and hacked the DNC anyway.\nThere are other variations on this theme, but central to all of them was the idea that without Fusion there would be nothing, and that we would know this if only we could know what Simpson said to the Senate investigators. But since the Senate intelligence committee wouldn\u2019t release the transcript, we couldn\u2019t know just how much Simpson had spilled his guts.\nSo now we know, and none of it supports the rickety Jenga pile of Republican conspiracy theories.\nInstead of being the source of the FBI investigations, Simpson claimed that the FBI was already on to the Russians, not least because our Australian allies warned us that the Russians claimed to have dirt on Clinton, which they learned because George Papadopoulos, a Trump advisor, was bragging about it to an Australian diplomat.\nAlso, according to Simpson, Steele was so horrified by what he was finding that he contacted the FBI instead of just reporting back to his Clintonian masters. Worse yet, Simpson describes Steele as finding the FBI so in the tank \u2014 not for Clinton, but for Trump \u2014 that Steele stopped cooperating with them.\nNow, it\u2019s possible that Simpson is a cool risk-taker who\u2019s willing to lie to Senate investigators. If that\u2019s the case, then we\u2019ve learned nothing. If Simpson, as critics of his testimony insist, is that untrustworthy, then so be it, but"}

Although any such craze tends to take a bit longer to creep up into Maine, I haven\u2019t noticed it popping up on Facebook, or the Food Network, either.\nTwo Filipino cookbooks, however, appeared in the Maine Sunday Telegram food editor\u2019s mail in recent months, which may be an indication that it\u2019s finally happening. As a fan of Southeast Asian food but unfamiliar with that of the Philippines, I eagerly picked up \u201cQuintessential Filipino Cooking,\u201d an approachable paperback of 75 recipes, from soups to noodle dishes, dipping sauces and desserts. Every recipe is accompanied by a full-page photo, making it easy to get a sense of the cuisine just by flipping through the cookbook.\nPhotos courtesy of Page Street Publishing Co.\nThe author, Liza Agbanlog, is a Filipino woman who immigrated to Canada and found herself struggling to re-create the meals she grew up eating, without being surrounded by people who could help or without having access to all the ingredients. She started a blog as a way to archive and share recipes, and that lead to the cookbook.\nThe recipes looked simple and contained familiar ingredients \u2013 a lot of chicken and pork, garlic and soy sauce \u2013 but still offered combinations that were new to me. There was tomato and salted egg salad, which is simply those ingredients, plus green onions, chopped and stirred with fish sauce and black pepper. Sinang or garlic rice looked like white rice with a fried egg on top, which it basically is, but with six cloves of garlic saut\u00e9ed until brown. The fried chicken is first marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and peppercorns.\nOther recipes called for more exotic ingredients \u2013 oxtail, sponge gourd, bitter melon and bone marrow \u2013 and yet others, like empanadas and flan, reflected the Hispanic influence on the island chain, named for King Phillip II of Spain.\nFor my introduction to eating and cooking Filipino food, I chose Chicken Bicol Express \u2013 spicy chicken in coconut milk \u2013 because it looked easy yet different from anything I\u2019d made before.\nSimmering the chicken in coconut milk made for tender meat, and the minced chiles gave it a good kick. The only wild card on the list of ingredients was shrimp paste, which, unsure if I was supposed to saut\u00e9 it separately first, I added straight from the container. That might have accounted for the strength of the unfamiliar funk that it gave the dish, signaling that I was eating something new \u2013 and I liked it.\nIn a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat.

Thompson.\nJudge Bua, of the Northern District of Illinois, further ruled that school systems must pay for such treatment even though it is administered by a psychiatrist. In the past, P.L. 94-142 had been interpreted to relieve school systems of the responsibility to pay for so-called \"medical services\"--those provided by licensed doctors--except when they were needed to diagnose and evaluate students, according to lawyers familiar with the law.\nHowever, Judge Bua ruled that the school system in the case, the New Trier Township High School District 203 in suburban Chicago, must pay only the equivalent of the cost of psychotherapy performed by psychologists, social workers, or guidance counselors, whose work is not considered to be a medical service under P.L. 94-142. Treatment by a psychiatrist is generally more expensive than that by a psychologist, social worker, or counselor.\nEarlier this year, Judge Bua, in another finding in the same case, ruled that school systems may under P.L. 94-142 be required to pay for ''compensatory\" treatment for special-education students once they have left school, if it is shown that the schools failed to provide adequate treatment while the students are under their jurisdiction.\nMax M. v. Thompson involves a student who was diagnosed as emotionally disturbed. In 1978, when the student, Max M., was a sophomore at New Trier Township High School, his parents sought intensive psychotherapy for him from the school system. The school system, according to its lawyer, John A. Relias, offered the treatment through a school-district social worker. The parents declined, and a year later they paid to have their son treated by a psychiatrist in private practice.\nThey sued the school system in 1982, contending that P.L. 94-142 required New Trier to reimburse them for the cost of the treatment and that it had to pay for additional treatment for their son--specifically, placement in a residential facility that offers both schooling and psychotherapy--because it failed to provide psychotherapy, a \"support service,\" when he attended school.\nMr. Relias said the case will now go to trial to determine whether the school system acted \"in bad faith\" in not advising the student of his procedural rights to appeal under P.L. 94-142; whether it must reimburse the parents for the cost of privately administered psychotherapy; and whether it must pay for compensatory treatment of Max M. in a residential psychiatric facility."}

Catch up on all the previews right here.\nRhett Peltier faced some very clear challenges when the Loreauville offensive coordinator took over the Tigers\u2019 football program. Coming off an 8-3 season with a second-round exit in the Class 2A playoffs, only 17 players returned from the previous season, seven of whom were starters in 2016. Peltier now has 50 players on the roster, but 18 of those are freshmen. The new players, however, have bought into Peltier\u2019s strategy. He said summer workouts maintained a 95 percent attendance rate, and veteran players are schooling young ones. Despite being just a sophomore, one of those \u201cveterans\u201d is quarterback Zy Alexander, one of the top returning signal callers in the Acadiana area. Peltier asked more of Alexander than he normally would of a freshman, but he consistently delivered in 2016. Alexander has a quality safety net in receiver Brennon Williams, and Leslie Joseph brings plenty of experience in the backfield despite being a first-year starter.\nOne of the advantages of Loreauville promoting Peltier is the familiarity with his personnel. But with few overall returners, the Tigers have been forced to make adjustments, specifically with the defense. Lacking the size it has had in previous years, including two-way linemen, Loreauville is switching from a 4-2-5 to a 3-3 Stack base defense. Peltier admits quick development has to happen basically \u201ceverywhere.\u201d The Tigers are breaking in three new receivers to its spread attack, and only two starters on last year's offensive line \u00ad(Austin Melancon and Ryan Bourque) return.\nSt. Thomas More offensive coordinator Shane Savoie can\u2019t help but notice the correlation between the size of his offensive line over the last two years and how the Cougars have finished each season. In consecutive trips to the Superdome, including the program\u2019s first state championship last season, the Cougars have been rather beefy up front. This year will be no different. Third-year starter Grant Young, an all-district guard, anchors a line that also features tackle Jonathan Harding and center Landon Burton. The trio should help create room from STM\u2019s three-headed monster in the backfield: Chris Primeaux, Sydney Lindon and William Cryer. But the real strength of this team should be the defense, which is flooded with experience. The Cougars return its leaders in tackles (linebacker Paul LaBorde), sacks (defensive end Sam Greenwood) and interceptions (safety Cade Broussard). Aside from Broussard, Jude Joseph returns as the team\u2019s best cover corner and one of STM\u2019s better athletes.\nThe Cougars have yet to determine a starting quarterback, and coach Jim Hightower is leaving open the possibility of playing two to start the season. Senior Peyton Landry commands the respect of his teammates, an advantage over sophomore Caleb Holstein, who is more physically gifted. STM has started a sophomore signal caller four times in school history, so it wouldn\u2019t be foreign territory for the Cougars to go with Holstein. Regardless, it will be tough to replace Nate Cox, who set the state title game records for touchdowns and passing yards.\n"}

He was just 18 years old on opening day and the first-overall pick of 2016 looked every bit as young last year as he struggled through five challenging months.\n\"I'm actually grateful for last season,\" Moniak said after sitting in the Phillies dugout Saturday as they fell to Baltimore, 4-2. \"That's the first time in my life that I really had to bear down after struggling for a while. I definitely learned a lot about myself, and going into the offseason I prepared my body for 140 games. I think I did a better job of that this year. It was a whole learning experience. There was some good. There was some bad. And I'm excited for this year.\"\nMoniak batted .236 at Lakewood with a .284 on-base percentage in 123 games. He struck out 109 times and worked just 28 walks. The Phillies scouted him heavily as a high schooler outside of San Diego. They said he was the best amateur hitter in the country. And one season is not enough to dampen their expectations. Moniak does not turn 20 until next month. The Phillies will stress patience.\nHe worked out this winter back home with a personal trainer. He reported to spring training a few weeks early, eager to start a new season. And he came with some motivation. Baseball America dropped him from its Top 100 prospect rankings in January after listing him last May at the 13th best in all of baseball. It was a sharp drop after being the top draft pick just 18 months earlier.\n\"I'm kind of happy about that,\" Moniak said. \"My whole life in high school, growing up, and even leading up to the draft, people didn't buy in to who I was as a baseball player. What happened, happened. Now people aren't fully sold on me right now and I'm definitely using that as fuel.\"\nMoniak shares an agent with J.P. Crawford, who faced similar criticism last summer as his prospect rankings dipped shortly before he arrived in the major leagues. The two have become close friends and Crawford is like an older brother, Moniak said. He told Moniak to ignore it and \"just be you.\"\nMoniak watched his friend Saturday as he leaned against a rail of the Phillies dugout. Moniak was called over from minor-league camp to join the Phillies for a day. He wore No. 88 and his uniform didn't have a name on the back. He was an anonymous reinforcement. He did not play, but the experience was awesome, he said.\nHe has talked often with Phillies manager Gabe Kapler, who told him to work hard and good things will happen. The manager is intense, Moniak said. He told Moniak that the Phillies will be watching. Moniak walked off the field after Saturday's loss, threw his equipment back over his shoulder, and walked back to the minor-league complex. A new season \u2014 and chance to prove people wrong \u2014 is a month away.\n\"The message to Moniak is that it's great to"}

I\u2019ve liked a lot of what I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m constantly being sent new music to review so a lot of times I only get to listen to an album once or twice and even if I like it, I have to move on to the next. Listening to music is a lot more work than I thought it\u2019d be, however, when I go on a long road trip I still like to listen to music for pleasure.\nI found myself popping in Sons of Sylvia\u2019s album \u201cRevelation.\u201d As soon as front man Ashley Clark goes into the second chorus of \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d I\u2019m hooked for the rest of the album. The crazy thing is I\u2019m more of a metal head. Korn and Rob Zombie have new albums out this year, but there is something about Sons of Sylvia that I really like. I recently chatted with Ashley Clark and Adam Clark of Sons of Sylvia.\nQ - You guys won the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d inspired reality show music competition \u201cNext Great American Band\u201d under the name The Clarke Brothers. How did you become involved in the show?\nAshley - We were sitting at home one night watching \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d when an ad came on for \u201cThe Next Great American Band.\u201d Ryan Seacrest was talking and he said, \u201cIf you are in a band and you think you\u2019ve got what it takes to make it, send in a DVD or video.\u201d We got a video camera, recorded a couple songs in Austin\u2019s basement, and got our audition tape sent out on the last day of eligibility. A few weeks later we got a call to play for the judges out in Las Vegas.\nQ \u2013 What was it like?\nAshley - Being on the show was intense and humbling. Although we\u2019d played together our whole lives, this was the first time the three of us were actually playing as a band. When we won the show it was surreal. It felt like slow motion. Months of hoping, praying, practicing came gushing out \u2013 I just fell down on the stage.\nQ \u2013 Why did you change your name?\nAshley - After the show we started writing for the album. Our sound changed as we discovered who we were, musically. As our sound changed we thought it made sense to change our band name to give us a fresh start, a sort of rebirth. Austin thought it would be nice to include our mom\u2019s name in the title. She had 11 kids so we thought it would be a cool monument to her.\nQ - I've always been one of those stubborn rock fans who says I can't stand country music (truthfully, I just never really gave it a chance). When I was given your CD to review, nobody told me you were a band that came from country roots. I thought I was listening to the next U2 (by that I mean a band that you really can't put a label on, a band whose music is accessible for every fan of music). If you had to describe your sound, how would you describe it?\nAdam - The word that comes to my mind is universal. Musically, our roots are in bluegrass and country, and that\u2019s typically what people assume we play when they see our instruments, but when they hear Ashley\u2019s vocals, Austin\u2019s flying \u201cV\u201d melobar, and the other effects in our songs, there really isn\u2019t one style that can be pinpointed.\nAshley - We\u2019re a little bit country, a little bit rock \u2018"}

CORE, the acronym for Collaboration Opportunities for Research and Exploration, is rising out of a 300-acre site dedicated to boosting the region\u2019s life-sciences sector to supercharge the economy with high-paying jobs.\nMercedes Medical, a women-owned and -operated medical supply company founded by Noelle Haft in 1991 in New York, has blossomed from a start-up into a success story with annual revenues in excess of $40 million and a customer list approaching 10,000. The enterprise, which moved to Florida in 1993, twice made the Inc. 5000 list of America's Fastest-Growing Companies.\nThe company is investing $10 million into its CORE project, with construction scheduled to be complete in November. The company supplies hospitals, physicians and labs with beakers, cylinders and flasks; microscopes, scalpels and centrifuges; medical charts, exam room supplies and pharmaceuticals, just to name a few in its long line of products.\nAlex Miller followed her mother, Noelle, to Sarasota in 1995 after college graduation to join the company. She has served as the CEO since 2003.\nQ: How did you come to select the CORE campus for expansion?\nA: After six months of exploring our options, including buying existing buildings, build to lease and other available lots in Manatee and Sarasota, we settled on the CORE for a few reasons. First, we have been in Manatee County for over 20 years, (and) our established relationship with their Economic Development Corp. and business-friendly climate was a big factor in assuring our project would get built on time.\nSecondly, more than half of our employees live in Manatee and we wanted to limit their commute as much as possible.\nThirdly, we felt the CORE, a life science business park, fit our business profile best.

He recently published the book he has been working on since 2001, entitled A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. Despite the off-puttingly dry title it is a cool-headed and witty guide to thinking clearly and rationally, and a deconstruction of sloppy information and what he calls \u201ccounterknowledge\u201d \u2013 the phenomenon we have come to think of as fake news.\nThis week alone the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stated despite photographic evidence to the contrary that \u201cthis was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration\u201d; President Trump\u2019s adviser Kellyanne Conway coined the phrase \u201calternative facts\u201d; and Trump himself announced an investigation into his claim that up to five million illegal votes were cast in November\u2019s US presidential election \u2013 a claim with no apparent evidence.\nWith this book, Levitin \u2013 who is from California and is currently based at McGill University, in Montreal \u2013 joins a chorus of experts, from journalists and academics to technologists and politicians, proposing ways of combating misinformation, whether it\u2019s the fake news being disseminated on social media or the lies being promulgated by the new US administration.\nMany see weeding out the truth as the sole responsibility of news publishers, both new-media publishers like Facebook and more traditional publishers. Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post recently wrote a column that could be seen as a manifesto for a new kind of journalism in the Trump era, under the headline \u201cThe traditional way of reporting on a president is dead. And Trump\u2019s press secretary killed it\u201d.\nBut Levitin takes a slightly different perspective, putting an onus on all of us to support the institutions that are crucial to the functioning of democracy and, as news consumers, to take personal responsibility not just for validating the news we share but also for taking a more critical approach to the news we consume.\n\u201cThere are three institutions that are crucial to the functioning of a democracy. And all of us need to reflect on them and give them our support, either financially or physically, by working for them.\u201d Those institutions are the scientific method, the legal system and the independent media.\nLevitin, whose book delves into the complexity of polling accurately, admits that he was taken by surprise by the outcomes of both the US election and the Brexit vote. \u201cPollsters had become complacent, and they\u2019re going to have to up their game. There were flaws in the system,\u201d he says.\nWhy is fake news so sticky? Are we being bombarded with so much information that our critical sense can no longer function? Or are we just lazy? It turns out that a number of factors are at play.\nHe says that we should be starting to teach critical-thinking skills to students as young as 10. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve failed an entire generation of kids by allowing them to go to the internet and think that was the end of the research enterprise, not just the beginning.

That includes at least $57,000 to every county in northeastern and central Pennsylvania. Luzerne County will receive the largest amount: $1.1 million.\nVolunteers at the Lake Silkworth Fire Department are dispatched at all hours of the day all over Luzerne County's Back Mountain.\nThe department has about a dozen volunteers, and those volunteer firefighters usually have to do year-round fundraising. But now, they're getting some help from the state.\n\"Trying to make money is a blessing. If we get money for free, it's a blessing. Any money helps,\" said Chief Jerry Walker, Lake Silkworth Volunteer Fire Department.\nThis money is coming at a time when fewer people are volunteering, and the cost of running a department is going up.\n\"There's a lot of training involved, and each class costs money. It costs money per class, and it's time and money. Not a lot of people have time to do that,\" Walker added.\nThe state is giving Lehman Township volunteer fire departments $20,000 to be split between Idetown and Lake Silkworth. Both departments often work together when battling big blazes. The money will go towards gear and training.\nIn total, volunteer fire departments in northeastern and central Pennsylvania are getting $7.9 million from the state.\n\"We might get some new members. We might get some new volunteers,\" said Walker.\nThe auditor general says this money is coming from a tax on fire insurance premiums.\nWood Dog is correct. This annual distribution of funds from the state is nothing new, it\u2019s been in the works for ages. The state sends a team of auditors in every few years to balance the books on expenditures- and they are VERY thorough and miss nothing. And \u2013 it\u2019s all a matter of public record. You can look the audit results up on-line. There\u2019s no denying there are a few bad apples-and they eventually get caught-they always do. Your taxes will go up several mils to have a paid fire department.\nAnd how much of this money will stolen by the members? We\u2019ll find out eventually I\u2019m sure.\nA few and I mean few give the volunteer fire services a bad name. Dont let the bad news disrupt from this small amount of money given to the volunteers. There is worse corruption in other organizations than that. It\u2019s what the news likes to report that only gets to the general public. If the news started running stories on how much more taxes will go up switching to a state wide fire protection system, and the billions it would cost people would start to open theirs eyes and help (with fundraisers and volunteering).

This is no consolation to people who morally object to terminating a pregnancy at any point in gestation, as we know from 40 years of divisive debate. To people who oppose abortion, exposing the casual harvesting of body parts was simply another layer of banality attached to the already horrific.\nIt isn\u2019t necessary to resort to hyperbole or inexactitude, as some have done, to bestir an ethical conundrum in many a moral mind. Even the liberally pro-choice Hillary Clinton described the videos as \u201cdisturbing\u201d when she first became aware of them \u2014 and before she was schooled by her pro-choice supporters. Clinton did make an honorable recommendation to study fetal-tissue procurement from abortion across the board. This would eliminate some of the political jockeying and place the issue in the bioethical realm where it belongs.\nIn time, perhaps the suspect will provide answers, which we can parse in search of helpful insights. So far, he\u2019s been unhelpful. Saying \u201cno more baby parts\u201d may suggest a motive, but it is also nonsensical. There will be more baby parts as long as there are abortions.

You can pack a basket or cooler and take in free outdoor concerts, simply go for a picnic or whatever you want. Time to start thinking of how to pack a delicious \u2014 and smart \u2014 picnic.\nDover (Del.) Post food columnist Judi Leaming is an avid traveler, so she\u2019s no stranger to packing food to go. She said fresh fruit is one of the best items to pack. If favorite fruits aren\u2019t in season, supplement fruit salad with frozen or canned fruit. Also pack toothpicks or plastic ware so dirty hands don\u2019t sully the salad. Another refreshing option is fresh salsa and chips.\nFresh fruit is a great choice, agreed Dr. Carol Giesecke, nutrition, consumer economics and health specialist at Delaware State University Cooperative Extension. Be careful, though, to wash everything - even cantaloupe and watermelon rinds that have been known to occasionally transmit food-born illness.\nMost people know that mayonnaise- or dressing-based salads can be a bad idea when exposed to heat.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a debate about whether or not mayonnaise is or is not a problem Why take the chance,\u201d Leaming said. Instead, Leaming said to pack a dressing and open it at the site. The preservatives should keep it fresh until then.\nGiesecke suggests keeping drinks and foods in separate coolers. The worst thing that could happen to soda or water if it gets warm is that, well, it\u2019s not as refreshing. Worse things could happen if food gets too warm, though, so it\u2019s smarter to keep them apart.\nLeaming said if taking something that absolutely cannot get warm, pack sandwich bags of ice and disperse them among the food \u2014 even sticking them throughout salads. Another trick is to freeze water bottles the night before and use them to keep things cool the next day.\nFeel free to send kids searching for sticks to roast marshmallows. Eating off a stick should be a safe bet.\n\u201cThe marshmallows get so hot, I wouldn\u2019t worry with that,\u201d Giesecke said.\nSome people skip the sticks and eat hot dogs uncooked. Not a good idea, she said. Granted, they should already be fully cooked, but listeria has been discovered on them in the past, so practice caution and use the open fire to cook them yourself.\nGiesecke said being careful is key. Hygiene and common sense are necessary. Just don\u2019t panic about it.\n\u201cThe bottom line is our digestive systems are really designed to get rid of most food-borne pathogens,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems is not so much getting the food there but in how long it sits out,\u201d Leaming said.\nSo once you get food there, get it chilled down quickly, or keep it in the cooler and serve from there. Nibbling on food, which means leaving it exposed, it usually not a good idea unless it\u2019s a dry snack like pretzels or trail mix.\nGiesecke said two hours should be about the maximum time for hot food that hasn\u2019t been kept hot, or cold food that hasn\u2019t been kept cold.\nFor leftovers, make sure to get them out of hot air quickly and get them cold. Produce is pretty forgiving, so if they look good fresh salads and veggies can be kept. Giesecke suggests using them to cook with.\nVis"}

This debate is central to the overall struggle for liberation in a period when imperialism is openly destroying whole areas of the planet. FIST remains firm in asserting that the primary role of revolutionaries in the U.S. is to defend and fight for the self-determination of oppressed nations in conflict with imperialism, especially U.S., West European and Japanese imperialism.\nToo often, what passes as the left in the U.S. makes the grave mistake of siding with white supremacy by disregarding facts and parroting imperialism\u2019s racist war narratives. What is of primary importance, then, is for revolutionaries to expose the true character of war within the context of the chaos U.S. imperialism is causing all over the globe.\nThis chaos includes the killing of more than 1.5 million people and creating 8 million refugees internal and external in Iraq, and hundreds of thousands of deaths in Afghanistan, destroying a stable government in Libya and sowing civil war, intervening to cause thousands of deaths and nearly 2 million refugees in Ukraine, to mention a few examples.\nWhen it comes to damage caused by U.S. imperialism, no situation is more acute at present than in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, U.S. imperialism\u2019s ally in the region, is waging a bloody invasion there in an attempt to reinstate the government of President Mansur Hadi, which had been compliant with U.S. and Saudi interests.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s ruling class sees its geopolitical and corporate interests threatened by the new Houthi-led provisional government, which has declared independence from Saudi Arabia\u2019s neocolonial rule. Saudi dominance has kept Yemen mired in poverty, sectarian strife and political repression. Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to the Houthis has been a brutal offensive that has killed over 4,000 people and injured over 7,000 more in Yemen.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s invasion of Yemen has the U.S. imperial stamp all over it. Without the billions of dollars worth of military aid from Washington in exchange for oil money, the House of Saud would not have the capacity to wage its war of aggression. Nor could it conduct its documented human rights abuses, from the indiscriminate repression of its Shia population to the longstanding practice of repressing any challenge to its rule, with impunity.\nHowever, U.S. imperialism\u2019s economic and geopolitical dependency on Saudi Arabia has silenced the \u201cinternational community\u201d on its human rights abuses. According to a report issued April 29 to the Congressional Research Service, from 2010 to 2014, Saudi Arabia received over $90 billion in military equipment and training from the U.S. (tinyurl.com/q2kd7h9), paid for with Saudi\u2019s enormous oil export income.\nThe U.S.-Saudi relationship has enriched the monopoly private military contractors and oil magnates of Wall Street.

If you're an expat European citizen, and you want to use your shred of influence on the only directly-elected body of the European Union, check out The Local's practical guide.\nVoting regulations are rarely lucid, but since the European elections are subject to both national and European rules, there's an extra layer of complication. All EU citizens over 18 have the right to vote in the European elections, as long as they live in the EU. But where you are allowed to vote depends on the rules of your native country and those of the country where you live.\nThe location of your vote, it should be noted, has an effect on its power. As the largest population in Europe, Germans return the most MEPs to the European Parliament (99 out of 785), and there are more German voters per MEP than in any other member state. This is a consequence of the recent Lisbon treaties, which ensure that smaller countries are not squeezed out. Mathematically, though, a vote in the EU's smallest state, Malta, is worth more than ten German votes.\nAs a non-German EU citizen living in Germany then, you have a unique choice. Obviously there are a few other factors to be considered when honing your voting tactics; for example, while the election is decided by proportional representation, some countries, including Ireland, the UK, Italy, France and Belgium are subdivided into electoral regions. Some countries also impose a 5 percent threshold which parties must reach to achieve representation.\nSimilarly, each EU member state decides individually how its citizens living abroad are allowed to vote. Some offer postal votes, some allow you to vote in the consulate or embassy, and some even accept a proxy vote.\nGreat Britain, for instance, accepts postal votes and proxy votes. Although the deadline for registering to vote has passed, anyone who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years is eligible to vote in the European elections, and there is still time to apply for a postal vote and return it by 10 pm on election day \u2013 though one should keep in mind that the UK's European election is being held on June 4!\nBut if you are an EU citizen, and have been living in Germany for more than three months, you should have received your vote notification (Wahlbenachrichtigung) to vote in the European elections from your district authority (Bezirksamt) in the post. If you haven't, it could be just because you have never voted in Germany before, but it does not mean that you are ineligible to vote.\nBut if you have been told by your local Bezirksamt that you really are not registered to vote in Germany, and perhaps some put-upon official has informed you've waited too long \u2013 you do in fact have one option left.\nAlthough the deadline for registering to vote \u2013 May 17 \u2013 has indeed passed, German electoral law requires that the electoral register is available to view, and may only be finalised 1-3 days before the election.

{"idx": "23687", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Some 47 GOP senators sent a letter to the Iranian leaders, in an attempt to undermine President Barack Obama's ongoing nuclear negotiations.\nAmerica looks weakest when its internal arguments spill over into its international diplomacy \u2014 something that has been rare in the nation's history.\nThat it is happening now is a blot on the 114th U.S. Senate; specifically, on the 47 Republican senators who signed an open letter to the Islamic Republic of Iran, a missive whose sole purpose is to end President Barack Obama's ongoing nuclear negotiations with that country.\nAmong the signatories of this letter are Sens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, all three potential 2016 presidential contenders. At minimum, signing such a letter should disqualify each man from holding the high office they seek to degrade.\nAt worst? Well, it's unlikely that, as some have suggested, this letter rises to the level of treason or violates the Logan Act, which bars unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. But it certainly betrays a deep misunderstanding of our governmental structure, and a profound and dismaying disrespect for the office of the presidency, as well as its incumbent occupant. To disagree with a sitting president is one thing, even if that disagreement is loud, even if it is raucous. A deliberate attempt to undermine a sitting president's efforts to discharge his constitutional obligations is something else entirely.\nLast week, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the floor of Congress. That, too, was a politically fraught act \u2014 Netanyahu also opposes Obama's deal \u2014 but this is a step farther.\nOrchestrated by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, this letter masquerades as a civics lesson. Addressed to \"the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" it begins with a note of condescension: \"It has come to our attention while observing your nuclear negotiations with our government that you may not fully understand our constitutional system.\" The letter goes on to explain that the U.S. Congress must ratify any binding international treaty. That's not precisely correct, as Harvard Law School professor and former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith writes on the Lawfare blog. Though Congress votes on a resolution of ratification, the actual duty is left to the president.\nThe letter goes on to warn that any agreement reached by Obama without Congress' approval carries only the weight of an executive order, and that a future president could reverse it with \"the stroke of a pen\"; a future Congress could amend it. (This, we will note, could be an argument against any country ever making a deal with the United States; new senators are elected every six years, new presidents every four).\nThe Iranians aren't buying it.\n\"In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy,\" Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said in a written statement published in the New York Times. \"I wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with 'the stroke of a pen,' as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"\nDaniel Drezner, writing in the Washington Post, notes that this letter may have the opposite effect its signatories intended \u2014 signaling to Iranian leaders that a new American regime would be less likely to make a deal, prompting more cooperation"}
{"idx": "23688", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The continuing denial by members of Oyster River School Board that they did nothing wrong in deciding not to hire nominee Justin Campbell as high school principal and then ousting Howard Colter as superintendent doesn't hold water. Neither does it make sense to Durham resident David Taylor, who filed a right-to-know request and has pursued full disclosure by filing action in Superior Court.\n\"Over the last few months, the district has had turnover of three top positions, including superintendent, director of instruction and high school principal. At meetings, the board has listened to multiple complaints from community members stating they had an agenda and were not providing open discussion with the community.\n\"Taylor claims the board has failed to inform the public of alleged meetings held just before the buyout of the superintendent's contract. The reason for the buyout has still not been unveiled to the public, and Taylor has said people have wanted answers.\"\nThere is, however, plenty of speculation that may indicate School Board members have talked privately to some district residents. One of several callers to Foster's, who did so, listed reasons in detail why Campbell was not hired and why Colter was for all practical purposes fired. When challenged how she knew so much the conversation quickly changed direction.\nAll this shenanigans is unfortunate. As several letter writers have pointed out, the School Board could have simply explained its actions early on and put this debate and doubt to bed. But as is often the case, secrecy breeds contempt and mistrust. And that is why the Oyster River School Board now finds itself challenged under the Right to Know Law.\n\"Openness in the conduct of public business is essential to a democratic society. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure both the greatest possible public access to the actions, discussions and records of all public bodies, and their accountability to the people.\""}
{"idx": "23689", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In thinking about the American idea, we decided to revisit a concept we first took up in these pages 25 years ago.\nScholars, novelists, politicians, artists, and others look ahead to the future of the American idea.\nAmericans value both order and freedom, and drawing a line between the two is no easy task. This may seem especially true where the more routine aspects of public order are concerned: How much freedom must be sacrificed in order to have quiet streets free of graffiti, aggressive panhandlers, prostitutes, and teenage gangs? Taken alone, few of these kinds of disorder constitute major crimes\u2014but taken together, they deeply worry people who want to go about their public business secure in the sense that our society, and not some disorderly faction within it, controls public spaces.\nIn 1982, we argued in this magazine that the police should take public disorder as seriously as they take criminal conduct. We urged them to resume doing what was once one of their major tasks: constraining the public activity of drunks, panhandlers, prostitutes, and gangs. And to this should be added a new assault on graffiti.\nWe suggested two rationales for this change: First, people feel threatened by public disorder; second, the chance that greater order would reduce crime rates. The first statement is obviously true; the second was a conjecture that has still been only partially tested.\nCommunity order, we argued, would bring decent people back on the streets and discourage criminals from using public places; certain kinds of crimes (assault, robbery, and auto theft), therefore, would subsequently decline.\nVirtually all of the evidence we have from studies of the police suggests that restoring order is associated with a drop in crime. This is reassuring, but it may not be conclusive. The idea has never been fully tested.\nPublic order is achieved neither by leaving alone everyone who is not a serious criminal nor by harassing everyone who uses the streets; it is achieved by a combination of family training, neighborhood norms, and official constraints that induce people to follow widely shared rules of behavior. Social science cannot settle the question of how much order ought to be maintained; that is a question of morality and politics. In this country, the public\u2019s view seems quite clear: People believe, we think rightly, that it is a good thing if routine misconduct is discouraged by the gentle action of opinion and authority. It is rarely necessary to arrest an aggressive drunk, a rowdy gang member, or a graffiti artist; it is usually sufficient to discourage them by firm reminders. True freedom is encouraged by an environment of public decency and discouraged by one of neglect and disorder.\nDecency in public places may be only a small part of the American idea, but especially for those people living in dangerous, gang-ridden neighborhoods, it is an important one."}
{"idx": "23690", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Global PC shipments continue to collapse, but there could be some light on the horizon.\nJust because things are bad doesn't mean they can't get worse. Two big market research firms are out with their latest estimates of global PC shipments, and the results aren't pretty.\nGartner estimated that PC shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter of 2016 to a low not seen since 2007. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of declines. IDC estimated an even larger decline of 11.5% year-over-year, slightly worse than the 11.3% drop expected.\nWhile the two reports differ slightly in their estimations, they both agree that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fared better than the rest of the industry. According to Gartner, Apple shipments grew 1% year-over-year during the quarter, while IDC had Apple shipments declining 2.1%.\nApple also appears to be gaining market share, with both reports showing Apple expanding its footprint, even edging out Asus on the IDC list as the #4 biggest vendor. Dell also appeared to be a market share winner, likely powered by its popular XPS laptop line that received rave reviews, as well as an update to the latest Intel Skylake processors earlier this year.\nThe primary driver behind the PC decline remains unchanged -- highly capable smartphones and tablets have reduced the need for consumers to purchase new PCs. This trend extends to emerging markets where people are skipping personal computers and going straight to smartphones.\nHowever, Gartner did offer one reason for the decline that is separate from the larger trend: the strengthening U.S. dollar. As central banks around the world, especially the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, continue to try to weaken their currencies, the U.S. dollar strengthens by comparison. This makes it more expensive for foreigners to purchase U.S. products.\nThe IDC report also cited global volatility in stocks and commodities as another reason for the decline. Frankly, I'm not exactly sure how this is directly connected to PC sales other than the fact that increased uncertainty could lead consumers to delay big ticket purchases like the family computer.\nAs the PC market continued to slump last year, all investors heard was, \"Just wait for Windows 10 to boost PC sales!\" Unfortunately, that has yet to happen.\nFirst, most consumers are still able to upgrade their existing personal computers to Windows 10 for free, so there is less of an incentive to purchase a new PC just to access the latest operating system from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nSecond, enterprise users are still testing Windows 10. With that in mind, both IDC and Gartner are upbeat about Windows 10 adoption toward the end of the year. IDC also notes that peak education and corporate spending on new PCs tends to happen during the second quarter.\nWhat does this mean for investors? While the numbers were far from encouraging, they were largely in line with expectations. Going forward, the question is whether we are finally approaching the bottom of the PC market.\nIDC believes total business IT spending is still expected to grow in 2016 compared with last year, especially as Windows 10 testing turns into actual adoption and purchases. We should then see some of that flow through to Microsoft's financial results.\nIntel should also benefit if the PC industry finally hits bottom and rebounds. However, the company now generates just as much of its profits from server chips as PC chips, so it's more diversified and insulated.\nApple is of course"}

Intel will demonstrate a prototype PC circuit board called \"Digital Creativity\" with IEEE 1394, or \"Firewire,\" support at the 1394 Trade Association's booth at Comdex.\nThe IEEE 1394 standard is a technology originally developed by Apple to allow for high-speed transfer of large amounts of data from peripherals such as digital camcorders to a computer.\nThe technology is significant because it spans the gap between consumer electronics devices and PCs. It also makes working with computers more like using a stereo system or TV because peripherals don't need to be configured: Theoretically, a consumer just needs to plug them in, and they are ready to work.\nAt Comdex, Intel will show a FireWire digital video camcorder hooked up to its PC platform for use in capturing, editing, and sharing digital video. Similar applications were shown at Comdex last year too, although this go-round will be one of the first times Intel has shown that it has incorporated the technology directly onto its own \"motherboard\" circuit board designs. A motherboard is the main circuit board in a PC and holds almost all the core electronics.\nBoth Microsoft and Intel are moving to use FireWire as a universal interface for peripherals such as storage drives, CD-ROM drives, DVD drives, and consumer electronics products. This is because FireWire can transfer data at rates of up to 400mbps, compared to 12mbps for Universal Serial Bus (USB) connectors, now commonly found on newer PCs.\nBefore the technology will find widespread adoption, however, both companies have to coordinate efforts for moving the technology into the platform.\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced specifications that would allow hardware vendors to create and incorporate peripheral devices into new computer systems, but this still leaves vendors the job of making the necessary software that enables the Windows operating system to control the devices.\n\"It's on Intel's roadmap as an important external bus, it seems to have their blessing, and that's an important endorsement for any industry initiative,\" says Andy Fischer, senior analyst at Jon Peddie Associates.\n\"The last two years at Comdex there have been FireWire [product] showcases, but it is in the high-end or 'prosumer' video production category. It's still a bolt-on [do-it-yourself] technology. There are all sorts of devices that want to be hooked up to a high-speed interface, but it [FireWire] won't be pervasive until its integrated on both the hardware and software side,\" he said.\nApple is already offering support in the Mac operating system for devices using IEEE 1394, although there aren't yet machines incorporating hardware ports yet.\nIntel will also be showing off Device Bay technology, which would allow users to plug a variety of devices such as a DVD drive or TV tuner into an external receptacle called a bay.

She's suing NASA to keep it.\nLaura Cicco claims the moonwalker gave her the memento when she was a child.\nIn a case that mixes nostalgia with serious questions about who is allowed to own materials brought back from space, a Tennessee woman is suing NASA to maintain possession of what she says is a vial of moon dust that astronaut Neil Armstrong gave her when she was 10 years old.\nCicco, then named Laura Murray, claims she received the memento while living with her family in Cincinnati. She maintains that Armstrong, who taught aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati at the time, had been a friend of her late father. Armstrong died in 2012.\nA handwriting expert authenticated the signature on the note, said Cicco\u2019s lawyer, Christopher McHugh of Kansas City, Missouri. Tests of the vial's contents found that \"there is no evidence to rule out a lunar origin,\" according to the court documents, but terrestrial materials from Earth's crust were also identified in the sample.\nCicco told the Washington Post that she had lost track of the vial until five years ago, when she rediscovered it in her father\u2019s belongings after his death, and that she had filed the suit in an effort to block NASA from trying to seize the moon dust.\nThe space agency declined a request by MACH to comment on the case, but it has a reputation for aggressiveness in its efforts to take possession of lunar samples held by private citizens. In one highly publicized case from 2011, NASA conducted a sting operation in Lake Elsinore, California, to seize paperweights containing slivers of moon rock that a 74-year-old woman was trying to sell.\n\u201cLunar samples that have been collected by U.S. government missions are considered unique and limited natural resources,\u201d said Michelle Hanlon, co-founder of For All Moonkind, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the Apollo lunar landing sites. \u201cNASA retains all lunar samples collected through U.S. government missions as NASA property.\u201d Hanlon is not involved in the case.\nThe outcome of Cicco's case will hinge on whether Armstrong or the government owned the dust at the time it was given, according to Christopher Johnson, a professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. and a space law expert. \u201cIf it\u2019s the property of the U.S. government, he could not have passed it along to somebody else \u2014 he didn\u2019t have the correct chain of custody or title for that,\u201d said Johnson, who is not involved in the case.\nIf there are no federal statutes against private ownership of materials from space, other experts say international law may provide some guidance. The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, signed in 1967 and commonly called the Outer Space Treaty, prohibits governments from claiming territory on the moon and other celestial bodies.

{"idx": "23707", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Warner Bros. has appointed IT and The Conjuring producer Walter Hamada to be their new president of production of DC movies, replacing Jon Berg and Geoff Johns. The studio decided to make the change back in December, in the aftermath of Justice League's underwhelming box office performance. Johns is still DC's president and chief creative officer, and will remain involved with the cinematic franchise as an advisor to Hamada.\nIt's no secret that the DC Extended Universe has had an uphill climb in these first few years of its existence. With the exception of last summer's Wonder Woman (which received widespread acclaim), its offerings have proven to be quite divisive. Things reached a tipping point back in November when Justice League premiered to decidedly mixed reviews and the worst opening weekend of the five DCEU films to date. The ensemble piece failed to find any traction commercially, petering out at $226.1 million domestically and $651.1 million worldwide - far less than anyone expected. As WB looks to pick up the pieces, they're making a major alteration behind-the-scenes.\nIn a report from Variety, it's said Hamada will oversee all of WB's comic book movies (not just those based on DC properties). The outlet cites \"widespread frustration\" at WB due to the new DC movies not rivaling the Marvel Cinematic Universe in terms of reception and box office figures. This move reads as an attempt for the studio to salvage their would-be flagship tentpole before matters get worse. A trio of DC films - Aquaman, Shazam, and Wonder Woman 2 - are on the schedule, and several others are in various stages of development.\nHamada had tremendous success during his time at WB division New Line. IT was a bona fide phenomenon when it was released in September 2017, breaking box office records en route to becoming the highest-grossing horror movie of all-time. The Conjuring was also a hit for the studio, earning $137.4 million domestically before spawning a full franchise complete with sequels and spinoffs. Because of his connection to The Conjuring, Hamada has a history with Aquaman helmsman James Wan, which might come into play with this new position. This December's Arthur Curry solo film was completed prior to the shift, but if Aquaman proves successful enough to warrant any followups, Hamada will be calling the shots.\nIdeally, Hamada will be to WB's comic book movies what Kevin Feige is to the MCU and Kathleen Kennedy is to Lucasfilm. If his track record is any indication, he knows what makes a quality movie, so hopefully he'll be able to work his magic in the superhero realm. The DCEU is in desperate need of a string of surefire hits, and if Hamada doesn't have better luck than his predecessors, then WB will truly be in a tight spot."}

A white paper on the mock attack, called Project Mayhem, is available on the SecureState website.\nFor hackers seeking big money, infiltrating an enterprise resource planning system would be like hitting the jackpot. Once inside, cybercriminals would have access to financial software, as well as applications driving business operations.\nMakers of corporate enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems include Oracle and SAP, while Microsoft's Dynamics Great Plains software is for midsize businesses.\nHacking Great Plans, or any other ERP system, requires more than just technical expertise, said Matthew Neely, research and innovation team director for SecureState. An accountant would also be needed to make sense of the information in the database and to manipulate accounts in a way to avoid immediate detection.\nProject Mayhem included tech experts and a certified public accountant SecureState had on staff. \"It's that blending of unique knowledge that facilities the ability to find [where to] attack,\" Neely said on Friday.\nWhat the researchers did was find a way to access the Microsoft SQL Server database through the Great Plains client. Before that can occur, a cybercriminal would have to trick a Great Plains user into clicking on a malicious email attachment or visit a web site capable of downloading the code.\nOnce the code is installed, it can intercept communications over ODBC between the client and the database and also inject commands, Neely said.\n\"Think of it as having a phone line between the client and the database. That's the ODBC connection,\" Neely said. \"We're tapping into that phone line and are able to hear what's being said and also talk into it.\"\nAt that point, a hacker could manipulate financial data and change entries to move funds to an outside account. SecureState researchers were able to alter the remittance address on vendor records, create a new vendor and manual check entry, change general ledger accounting records, increase customer credit limit and credit the balance in a customer account in order to get a refund.\nDepending on its sophistication, actual malware could go undetected by anti-virus software. How long it remained hidden would depend on the kind of security technology in use.\n\"The malware as it is right now is very much in a proof of concept state,\" said Spencer McIntyre, a SecureState researcher and creator of the tool, said. \"What we mean by that is we haven't weaponized it. All we wanted to do was show that it is possible.\"\nRegardless of the security technology in use, companies should also have accounting procedures in place to regularly check financial records for unusual entries.\n\"One of the goals [of the research] is to encourage accounting departments to adopt more stringent controls that could detect these attacks,\" Neely said.\nDespite the critical importance of ERP security, the software often goes unpatched for long periods of time, because of the complexity of updating the often highly customized systems.\nIn May, consulting firm Onapsis released a study showing 95 percent of more than 600 SAP systems tested were vulnerable to attack, mainly because patches had not been applied."}

The academy has for years maintained that the networks reap millions in profit from the Emmys and that the organization should get a larger share of that pie.\nThe Emmys are a special case, however, in that they rely on the networks' participation and good will. For that reason, flirting with a single-network deal has always been risky for the academy, leading to retaliation from the left-out broadcasters that some felt could significantly undermine the organization's future."}

But the contempt is clear.\nThe racially charged graffiti appeared in mid-October on cars, homes and telephone poles in the small city of Kokomo, Indiana. Many victims, like Peters, were African American, though some were not. Many also had lawn signs for Democratic candidates in this week's presidential election, and the signs at several homes were painted over with the Ku Klux Klan's notorious initials.\n\"I think it's a political thing; it's getting out of hand,\" said Peters, who believes the heated tenor of the presidential campaign - and especially the aggressive, nativist rhetoric of Republican candidate Donald Trump - has emboldened extremists.\n\"When you have (candidates) saying ignorant things, maybe other people think it's ok to do this stuff, and that's pretty doggone sad ... It seems like our country is going backwards.\"\nPolice have no suspects in the attacks. Democrats, including the mayor and local party officials, believe they were politically motivated. Local Republicans are skeptical, suggesting the damage is the work of ignorant hooligans with no place in the party.\nAcross the United States, the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate.\nIt's hard to quantify the impact; there is no national data that tracks politically motivated crimes or incendiary speech.\nHowever, the percentage of voters who believe insulting political opponents is \"sometimes fair game\" has climbed over the campaign season, from 30 percent in March to 43 percent in October, according to surveys by the non-partisan Pew Research Center. A majority of voters for both parties have \"very unfavorable\" views of the other party - a first since Pew began asking the question in 1992 - and distrust in government is hovering near all-time lows.\n\"These indicators reflect inter-group tensions that can translate into everything from coarse discourse or low levels of aggression all the way up to extremist acts,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.\nWhile much of the venom has been aimed at immigrants, African Americans and other groups typically aligned with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Republicans also have faced vitriol and hostility.\nMuch of the debate over extremism has focused on the so-called Alt-Right, a loose-knit movement of white nationalists, anti-Semites and immigration foes that has emerged from the political shadows to align itself with the Trump campaign.\nTrump's vows to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport millions of illegal immigrants and scrutinize Muslims for ties to terrorism have energized the Alt-Right community.\nSuch rhetoric has helped legitimize the Alt-Right's concerns about an erosion of the country's white, Christian majority, said Michael Hill, a self-described white supremacist, anti-Semite and xenophobe who heads the League of the South, a \"Southern Nationalist\" group dedicated to creating an independent \"white man's land.\"\n\"The general political climate that sort of"}

Instead, after a relatively brief opening statement in which Zuckerberg retread familiar ground, every single MEP (as members of the European Parliament are known) asked their question in a row, after which Zuckerberg gave a summarizing speech that lasted barely 25 minutes.\nFor example, Zuckerberg faced a sustained line of questioning about how Facebook builds \"shadow profiles\" on non-Facebook users and whether users can opt out - but Zuckerberg barely touched upon this in his responses. And he flatly ignored questions about whether the company would commit to publishing breakdowns of its legal entities and financials in the countries it operates, as well as a question on whether he would let users opt out of targeted advertising altogether.\nAfter he concluded, frustrated MEPs attempted to interject with more questions, only for the CEO to dodge and promise to have his team follow-up and provide written answers.\nDamian Collins MP, chair of the British Parliamentary DCMS committee which has repeatedly asked Zuckerberg to testify in the UK, only to be snubbed, responded angrily, blasting the event as a \"missed opportunity.\"\n\"What a missed opportunity for proper scrutiny on many crucial questions raised by the MEPs. Questions were blatantly dodged on shadow profiles, sharing data between WhatsApp and Facebook, the ability to opt out of political advertising and the true scale of data abuse on the platform,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point.\n\"I echo the clear frustration of colleagues in the room who felt the discussion was shut down.

Follow her on Twitter @arianetabatabai.\nRecent reports that Oman had joined the Saudi-led collation to fight terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS), took many by surprise. In an increasingly polarized Gulf region, relations between Oman and Saudi Arabia had been tense over the Sultanate\u2019s continued ties to Iran and its recent refusal to join several key Gulf security arrangements and efforts. Muscat\u2019s decision to sign on to Riyadh\u2019s Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism (IMAFT) was thus read as a sign that Oman was ready to shift politically, military, and economically toward its neighbor to the west and that Saudi Arabia was gaining the upper hand in the region. In reality, however, the move does not represent a swing in Omani policy. It is actually a continuation of the country\u2019s decades-long strategy of balancing between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nSaudi Arabia spearheaded the creation of IMAFT in December 2015. The alliance is made up of 40 Muslim countries, but it excludes two Shia-majority countries in the region, Iran and Iraq, as a check on what Riyadh views as Iran\u2019s meddling in Arab affairs. When the alliance was first announced, Oman declined to join so that it could maintain its traditionally independent foreign policy and not upset the status quo with Iran.\nMuscat\u2019s recent reversal on IMAFT came at a time of increasing disillusionment with Tehran; Oman had expected to see greater economic dividends from Iran\u2019s international reintegration after the 2015 nuclear deal. But business was slow to resume as Iran prioritized ventures with more lucrative partners, such as the European Union. The Sultanate felt that Tehran was dragging its feet on a number of joint projects, including the Oman-Iran gas pipeline. In 2013, Iran and Oman had signed a memorandum of understanding through which Oman would begin importing 28 million cubic meters of gas from Iran in 2015. But the pipeline was rerouted in 2016, and the operational date was delayed to 2017. Oman\u2019s relationship with Tehran is longstanding and durable."}

While the market for high-end systems designed to play the latest games has definitely been declining for some time, it remains a niche that supports a range of companies and products.\nJust this week, two of those companies have announced new desktops for those who still prefer to game on a PC than on a console (or smartphone or tablet). CyberPowerPC hopes to capitalize on the improved components that can be squeezed into small-form-factor PCs with the launch of its new LAN III series, which comprises four tiny desktops.\nLeast impressive is the Mini-A, which is built around an AMD A4-5300 processor with HD7480D graphics, but starts at just $439. It also fits 4GB of RAM and 500GB hard drive into a sleek Fractal Design design. The $695 Mini-I sticks with integrated graphics, but this time as part of its Intel i7-3770K CPU; it also uses a BitFenix Prodigy chassis with a carrying handle.\nFor $100 more, the Mini LAN III Xtreme (pictured above) comes with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 discrete graphics card, though the Intel processor is a Core i5-3570K, rather than a Core i7. You also get 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive in the same case as the Mini-I. Finally, the LAN III Commander edition bumps the processor up to a Core i7-3820 and the graphics card to a GeForce GTX 670 and replaces the hard drive with a 128GB solid state drive. It comes in a less-portable Cooler Master HAF-XB chassis, and is priced from a not-so-small $1,395.\nAbout twice that amount will get you the lowest-priced configuration of Digital Storm's new Hailstorm II desktop, which looks the part of a traditional gaming PC with its liquid cooling and massive Corsair Obsidian Series 900D case. The Hailstorm's cooling options border on the insane, with space for up to 15 fans or four radiators, and the Corsair chassis offers room for up to 10 expansion slots, nine SSD or hard drives, and four optical drives.\nStarting at $2,762 (yes, you read that right), the Hailstorm II at that price includes a Core i7-3770K, 16GB of RAM, GeForce GTX 680 graphics, 120GB SSD, 1TB hard drive, and Blu-ray drive. For about $80 more, you can jump to a Core i7-3930K CPU, 240GB SSD, and the new Nvidia GeForce Titan graphics card .

Some congressional Democrats have raised the possibility of new talks to address their concerns about the enforcement of labor, environmental and prescription drug provisions.\nThe Trump administration imposed the metals tariffs on most trading partners in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, using a national security rationale.\nHowever, it is unlikely the administration will send Congress the pact&apos;s implementing legislation before March 1 because congressionally mandated studies and reports won\u2019t be ready by then, Grassley acknowledged.\nThe three countries have agreed that the United States take up the agreement first. Grassley said he expects Congress to receive implementing legislation sometime in the spring. He added that Canada needs to act on the trade pact before its lawmakers leave to campaign for re-election in the fall.\nGrassley is sympathetic to the Canadian and Mexican positions. He and other lawmakers have called for ending the steel and aluminum tariffs on both countries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very important that the White House get on board on doing away with these tariffs so we can get this thing not only before the Congress of the United States, but before the Senate in Mexico and the Parliament, House of Commons, in Canada,\u201d Grassley said.\nGrassley said officials in Canada and Mexico believe continued imposition of the tariffs is unfair.\nGrassley also said that Canada and Mexico are unwilling to renegotiate, which some Democrats say may be necessary to achieve changes they want.\n\"I can tell you visiting with the ambassador of Mexico last week and the foreign minister of Canada there is not going to be any reopening of negotiations,&apos;&apos; Grassley said. \"Mexico&apos;s had their bellyful of these negotiations.

Reusable bags are creating their own environmental problems. What\u2019s the answer?\nApril 26, 2011, 10:07 a.m.\nOver the weekend, we took a minivan full of stuff to Goodwill. Included were several reusable cotton bags that we\u2019d been given over the years from businesses and organizations \u2014 bags that I never used because we have so many reusable bags, and I\u2019ve discovered which ones meet my needs the best. The rest just sit there.\nSometimes they go unused because they are of inferior quality. Sometimes they go unused because they end up in a pile of other free, unused reusable bags. Sometimes the person who accepted it never gets into the habit of using it.\nWith all of these bags going unused, a new environmental problem is developing \u2014 bags that end up getting thrown away without having been used. When the Chicago Bears gave away 40,000 bags at a 2009 game, many of them ended up in the stadium trash. I wonder about the bags that I took to Goodwill over the weekend. Is anyone ever going to use them?\nEven if the giveaways do get reused, they might not get reused enough.\nA nonwoven polypropylene bag, for example, would have to be used just 11 times to make up for the negative effects of a plastic bag used one time, according to a British Environment Agency study that compared bags. A cotton bag, however, would have to be used 131 times.\nSo if reusable bags aren\u2019t solving the one-time use problem and they\u2019re causing some environmental problems themselves, what\u2019s the answer?\nFor consumers, stop accepting free reusable bags that won\u2019t get used. Just like we politely decline the free paper or plastic bags at checkout, we need to start politely declining a free reusable bag that we know we\u2019ll never use again.\nFor businesses and organizations wanting to give away bags as freebies for marketing purposes, consider the quality and the usefulness of the bags you\u2019re giving away.\nFor legislators, banning or placing a tax on the use of one-time use bags is proving to be effective, while bag giveaways and small rebates for reusable bags are not. When bans and taxes are enforced, people use those reusable bags more often. The use of plastic bags decreases significantly, and fewer plastic bags end up on the sides of roads and in our waterways.\nDo you have reusable bags in your home that go unused?"}

Exact figures are difficult to be estimated but a further 40,000 people are believed to have gone off-grid in the UK.\nOne such community is Scoraig, an 80-strong off-grid settlement located on a secluded peninsula on the north-western coast of Scotland.

If so, it certainly sounds like the MEU is keeping busy.\nMills says that he has \u201cforces in a little piece of Kandahar province in order to relieve some of the Army forces there so they can concentrate on Kandahar.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer any additional details initially, but that\u2019s certainly news to a lot of folks following along at home.\nUPDATE: A Marine spokesman later clarified that the RC-South troops in Kandahar are British in, and deployed in Maiwand district, which borders Helmand. A commenter below suggests they\u2019re from 2 Royal Welsh, which would make sense.\nMills says Nimroz province, to Helmand\u2019s west, is a \u201cprovince of import,\u201d even though Marines haven\u2019t operated there much recently. In particular, a border crossing between Nimroz and Iran needs policing, he says.\nThings could get interesting this summer if details Mills laid out this weekend are any indication.\nIn addition to working in Helmand and Nimroz provinces, Marines could be sent to other, neighboring provinces as they expand their reach and \u201csecurity bubble,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re bound to look to the west into Farah province, we\u2019re bound to look to the east a little bit into Kandahar to link up to with the Army over there, and also to the northeast where, again, beyond the Kajaki Dam up into Bagram and Uruzgan to begin to expand that security bubble around some key economic corridors that exist,\u201d Mills said.\nA substantial amount of conventional Marine forces operated in Farah before RC-Southwest existed.

He was overseeing a dream team of competent and eager soldiers from various U.S. allies\u2014Canada, the Netherlands, Romania, and the United Kingdom\u2014and yet he couldn\u2019t provide information to them out on the field because they had each arrived with completely different communications gear, whether it was FM radios or satellite phones.

In the past, partly because there was no technology that could push timely intelligence and orders down to each soldier in the combat zone, commanders\u2019 instructions were always relayed to officers directing each unit on the ground, who then passed on the instructions to the soldiers. In many armed forces, though not in the U.S. Army, that\u2019s still the case.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just one country, the battlefield is already complicated enough,\u201d Freakley, now a special adviser to the president of Arizona State University, told me. \u201cBut when allies\u2019 equipment doesn\u2019t work [with ours] it adds further complication.\u201d They worked around the problem by installing a backbone network that the allied forces could tap into and by lending them equipment."}

The U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says transport is responsible for 14 percent of emissions.\nRuminants such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats produce nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane, which is the most emitted gas and is released through belching.\nScientists are working on ways to reduce those emissions, including by breeding animals that burp less, adjusting their diets so they produce less methane and planting trees in pastures.\n\u201cWe domesticated ruminants over 10,000 years ago and relatively little has changed. It\u2019s time that got an upgrade,\u201d said Elizabeth Latham, co-founder of Texas-based Bezoar Laboratories.\nHer company is working on a type of probiotic - helpful bacteria or yeasts in the digestive system - which has shown a 50 percent reduction of methane emissions in cattle during research.\nAlthough less prevalent than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, methane is more potent because it traps 28 times more heat, according to a 2016 study by the Global Carbon Project, which groups climate researchers.\nBezoar\u2019s probiotic can be put in water or feed, and even sprinkled on grass, said Latham, who won a Unilever Young Entrepreneurs Award in 2017 for the patent-pending product.\nThousands of miles away, New Zealand\u2019s AgResearch has bred sheep to produce 10 percent less methane.\n\u201cIn a single sheep, a 10 percent drop maybe not so significant. But when there\u2019s 19 million sheep in the country, it starts to make a huge impact,\u201d said Suzanne Rowe, a geneticist at the government institute.\nThe low-methane sheep are the result of a decade of research, and they are also leaner and grow more wool, she said.\n\u201cThe beauty of breeding the animal to be low methane\u2026 is it\u2019s permanent,\u201d Rowe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding the team is conducting similar research on cattle and deer.\nAgriculture accounts for nearly half of New Zealand\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, and transforming the sector is key to meeting the target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, Climate Change Minister James Shaw has said.\nAttempts to reduce methane emissions from livestock are not limited to the world\u2019s most affluent nations.\nIn India, a national programme to boost the milk production of cows and buffalos by improving their diet is also helping the environment, according to Rajesh Sharma, senior manager at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).\nThe NDDB uses software to assess the ideal diet for an animal, based on its physical profile and environment.

{"idx": "23759", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A strong Diaspora community will always be needed to lobby for the Jewish State and influence key nations to support Israel's cause. A situation in which all the Jews move to Israel is not desirable.\nThe return of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel is an integral part of the Divine Plan. According to the late Jerusalem Old City Kabbalist Rabbi Mordechai Atiya, author of Lech Lecha \u2013 Sod HaShvua, all of the trials and tribulations that befall the Jewish People in their long exile are messages sent from heaven to awaken the Jewish People to leave the foreign lands they dwell in and return to Zion.\nOn a micro level, the life of the Or HaChaim (Rabbi Chaim Ben Attar) is an embodiment of this teaching that the tragedies of the exile are divine signals to prod the Jewish People to return to Israel.\nIn his native Morocco, the Or HaChaim was targeted by the government, falsely accused of things that he had no part in, thrown into jail on more than one occasion, and even thrown once into the lions den - coming out unharmed. In 1738 when hunger plagued Morocco, he began his long journey to Israel.\nIn the introduction to his Torah commentary, the Or HaChaim writes: \"Those who pursued me didn't turn back. I prayed for peace, but behold, enemy after enemy assaulted me, one trouble after another, until I was up to my neck in distress. I wondered from town to town, becoming a fulfillment of the verse, 'He that flees from terror, shall fall into the pit\u2026' And G-d opened my eyes, and I realized that the reason for these troubles was none other than to signal me to ascend to the place of the Shechina, the city which is so exalted and so dear to G-d of the world.\"\nNote that the final straw that convinced the Or HaChaim to make aliya was the financial collapse in Morocco induced by famine. It was not a decree specifically targeting the Jews.\nRav Mordechai Atiya states emphatically in his book that sooner or later, the Diaspora will be emptied of all its Jews, adding,\" And happy is the man who saves himself and his family in advance by making aliyah to Eretz Yisrael [pg. 3].\nRegarding the first redemption from Egypt, the Torah says, \"\u2026afterwards he [Pharaoh] will let you go from here; when he shall let you go completely, he shall surely expel you out from here\" . The Torah commentator Rabbeinu Bachyeh explains the use of the word kaleh [completely]: \"when Pharaoh sends you out, he will send all of you, and will not leave a single one of you.\" \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\" - \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05de\u05d4\u05dd \u05d1\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\"\nSo, too, regarding the final redemption, the prophet Yechezkel says, \"\u2026and I will gather them into their land, and I will not leave any of them there\" . Rashi explains: \"I will not leave one of them in the exile.\nHence, the liquidation of the Jewish presence outside of Israel and the return of every last Jew to Israel follows the paradigm, \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05db\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\"What was in the past (in the redemption from Egypt) is what will be in the future (in the final redemption).\"\n"}

Because then I wouldn\u2019t take him for two reasons, but the number one reason is the fact that he would have been wrong. If he said that there\u2019s no collusion, he\u2019s right.\nSo Trump admitted that belief of collusion would have been his \"number one reason\" to have rejected Whitaker.

He wrote, \u201ceither Whitaker failed to file (illegal) or DOJ is determined to hide them from you (illegal).\nWallace brought up none of that.\nWALLACE: [Whitaker] is going to have to make or could potentially make a lot of big calls in the Mueller investigation.

If Mueller issues a final report, he can decide how much goes to Congress or doesn\u2019t go to Congress.\nYou tweeted this week about, quote, Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs.\nWALLACE: If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller investigation, are you OK with that?\nTRUMP: Look, he\u2014it\u2019s going to be up to him.

It says a prospectus, or circular, distributed to potential investors included misleading claims about the company\u2019s ability to produce 5,000 Model 3s per week, a number Musk and other company leaders touted.\nThe Gigafactory in Storey County east of Sparks is where Tesla manufactures batteries and power trains for the Model 3. The company decided to build in Nevada after the state legislature and governor approved a public subsidy package worth an estimated $1.3 billion over 20 years. The factory employs several thousand people and the company has already spent billions on construction.\nThe plaintiffs say claims about Model 3 production were important because mass production of the vehicle is critical to the company\u2019s ability to turn a profit.\nThe complaint highlighted claims in the circular about the company\u2019s ability to produce at both the automotive factory in Fremont and the battery-producing Gigafactory in Nevada.\nThe complaint says those claims were false and misleading because the company lacked the ability to meet those numbers.\nIt cites numerous articles detailing production problems both in California and Nevada that published in the weeks and months after Tesla issued the investment circular.\nTesla eventually reached the goal of 5,000 Model 3s in a single week in June, according to reports.\nTesla hasn\u2019t responded to the California court in writing, but a spokesperson for the company pointed to an Aug. 24 decision by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer that dismissed claims similar to those by the Teamsters\u2019 fund.\nIn that case, shareholder Gregory Wochos argued Tesla misled the public by over-estimating the number of vehicles it could produce.\nHowever, Breyer dismissed that complaint by saying Musk and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission included enough warnings and cautionary statements to alert investors that there were circumstances that could cause the company to miss such ambitious goals.\nThe Teamsters suit isn't the company's only recent legal dispute. Musk and the company were each recently fined $20 million by the SEC after Musk tweeted in August that funding was secure to take the company private at $420 per share.\nThe funding didn't materialize and in addition to the fines, Musk relinquished his role as Chairman of the Board but retained his CEO title.\nThe company is also engaged in legal disputes with two former Gigafactory employees who claim they were wrongly fired after reporting problems."}

And in the end, he decided to put a hold on all marijuana cases in municipal courts statewide until at least Sept. 4.\nIf you listen to Grewal, a gracious man, he fits the mold of the top state law enforcement officer.

He readily acknowledges he was taunted, like most Sikh boys in America, in elementary school in Bergen County because they wear their hair long and in a bun.\n\"One hundred percent of the time,\" he said with no trace of bitterness in his voice.\nLittle did he know during our conversation that soon after, at age 45, he would face taunting again, this time at the hands of adults: two radio hosts who derisively referred to his turban during a discussion of his marijuana policy.\n\"This is not the first indignity I've faced and it probably won't be the last,\" he wrote in response on Twitter. \"Sometimes, I endure it alone. Yesterday, all of New Jersey heard it. It's time to end small-minded intolerance.\"\nGrewal recalled for me that when his parents moved to Bergen County, the Glen Rock temple where his family worships was undeveloped and they sat under tents. Today, he brings his three girls -- ages 5, 7, and 9 -- to the active and developed temple, where Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, also Sikh, worships with his family.\nGrewal, an only child, considers Bhalla and Bhalla's brother, Amar, like his own brothers.\nThe court-appointed public defenders had less than two hours to meet with all the defendants to prepare for the proceedings -- translating to less than 2 minutes of individual time per defendant.\nBrotherhood is a desired goal of Sikhs, who welcome anyone to their temples.

Two income households often lack the time to sit down at the dinner table to discuss manners and etiquette.\nManners have been taught outside the home since the 1800s, Combs said. The basic manners of treating people with kindness, table manners, and how to treat your peers are pretty much the same.\nSome social expectations have changed over the years, she noted. For example, in the not so distant past, it was appropriate and expected for men to open doors for women.\n\"I think women are definitely capable of opening their own door,\" Combs said. \"But we work so hard during the day.\"\nIt doesn't matter who opens the door, a man or woman.\n\"I think everyone\u2019s happy to have a little small act of kindness thrown their way, she said.\nWith the etiquette classes, the students learn a set of social behaviors that kind of give them guidelines on how to behave and what to expect in different situations, she said.\nEtiquette and manners for children are just the beginning for the new school.

{"idx": "23778", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals.\nSeveral prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that.\nMany others across the ideological spectrum have challenged those conclusions, saying the plan would cause the nation\u2019s debt to rise substantially faster than the economy. Deficit-financed tax cuts are widely believed to undermine growth.\nThere is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases. Critics counter that there is little historical evidence for that claim.\nThe New York Times invited two economists to offer their views in an email exchange on the plan\u2019s economic merits and drawbacks. They are Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Kimberly A. Clausing, an economist and tax expert who teaches at Reed College. Their responses were condensed and edited.\nHow will these tax proposals affect the economy?\nThe economic logic is straightforward and time tested. Better incentives \u2014 like lower tax rates, being able to write off investments, taxation only on earnings in the United States \u2014 will encourage innovation, investment, hiring and pay raises. These incentives increase the accumulation of capital, whether in physical equipment or intellectual know-how.\nThis capital deepening \u2014 having more and better capital for each worker \u2014 reverses recent trends and raises productivity growth. More rapid productivity growth, in turn, raises the real wages of the middle class and restores upward mobility to a stagnant labor market.\nThere is nothing wrong with the idea that reducing a tax on capital will spur investment, which should increase worker productivity and, eventually, wages. But these models ignore important features of the real world, the tax code and the proposed tax law changes.\nFirst, the current tax system already encourages debt-financed investment, but that incentive actually diminishes under the proposed changes. Second, we are already living in a world awash in capital; a shortage of capital supply is not the problem holding back investment.\nCompanies have historically high levels of after-tax profits. Why do we think giving an even larger windfall to shareholders will suddenly fuel investment?\nFor companies to seek new investment, they need a healthy middle class. Perhaps that is why so few C.E.O. hands went up at a recent event when asked if they would use tax cuts to increase investment; few companies plan new investments in response.\nWhat will be the impact on the deficit?\nThe bills\u2019 backers conveniently assume away the deficits that finance these tax cuts; such deficits are likely to either raise interest rates or increase borrowing from foreigners (such that more of the country\u2019s income flows abroad in the future), or do both. Even estimates accounting for growth effects, by nonpartisan entities such as the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, find that the bills increase deficits by $1 trillion to $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Those factors will be a drag on the growth of American living standards.\nWhile the backers of the bill emphasize its supply-side benefits, the growth effects of these tax bills are being vastly oversold. Future taxpayers will be left with both increased income inequality and higher debt burdens. By 2027, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, 84 percent of households will face either a tax increase or a tax cut that is smaller than $100. This will be small consolation for the future taxes needed"}

Putin told reporters that Trump brought up Nord Stream 2 during the meeting. The project, which is under construction, is an expansion of the world\u2019s longest undersea pipeline, which links Russia and Germany.\nDespite positioning itself as a neutral business venture, Nord Stream 2 has become an intensely political project. The State Department views it as a threat to the national security of its allies in Europe, a way to circumvent an existing pipeline that runs through Ukraine, and a threat to Kiev through the loss of a major income source.\nThe two entities Putin referred to are Russia\u2019s Gazprom and Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz. The two companies have been locked in a legal battle since 2014 over transit contracts and payments. A Swedish court\u2019s decision on the dispute is expected to set the course of the relationship between the two companies. Gazprom would face hefty fines if the Stockholm court rules in favor of Naftogaz.\nGazprom owns a majority stake in Nord Stream 2, which is scheduled for completion by next year. Roughly half of the project is financed by a group of German, Austrian, French, Dutch, and British companies in a joint venture with Gazprom.\nDuring the NATO summit earlier this month, Trump criticized Germany for working on Nord Stream 2 with Russia. The president said it was \u201csad\u201d that Berlin is buying energy from Moscow while depending on Washington to play the role of a military deterrent against Russia in Europe.\nThe gas dispute between Kiev and Moscow can be traced back to the beginning of the conflict between the two countries. Then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of a natural gas deal with Gazprom. The resulting protests by Ukrainians led to Yanukovich\u2019s ouster and replacement with Russia hawk Arseniy Yatsenyuk.\nShortly after, Russia invaded Crimea and declared its annexation. The United States does not recognize the annexation, and Trump reaffirmed that position at the summit with Putin. The United States has sanctioned several Russian officials connected to the annexation.\nU.S.\u2013Russia relations deteriorated as the conflict in Ukraine persisted. Russian-backed separatists still hold a large swath of Ukraine and continue to battle Ukrainian forces. The war has claimed 8,000 lives to date. American and European officials see Nord Stream 2 as another way for Russia to undermine Ukraine.\nTrump told reporters in Finland that relations with Russia were at an all-time low leading up to the summit but that the meeting with Putin has changed all that.\n\u201cDuring the tensions of the Cold War, the U.S. and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue. Our relationship has never been worse than it is now,\u201d Trump told reporters on July 16.\nIf allowed to proceed, Nord Stream 2 would double the capacity of the current Nord Stream pipeline to 3.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year by 2019.

For years, IT consulting and outsourcing specialist Cognizant Technology Solutions has made it its mission to help its clients get more out of the technology they use. Coming into its second-quarter financial report Wednesday morning, investors wanted to see signs that Cognizant&apos;s impressive past growth would continue, and they were curious as to which parts of the company would produce the best results and contribute the most toward Cognizant&apos;s overall success.\nIn the report, Cognizant reported record results, and boosted its future guidance as it sustained an impressive pace of expanding sales. Let&apos;s take a closer look at Cognizant, and see whether its latest performance is just the beginning of even better things to come.\nCognizant keeps climbing higherCognizant&apos;s second-quarter results included some favorable surprises from the IT consulting specialist. Revenue jumped almost 23%, to $3.09 billion, powering ahead at an even faster pace than the 20% rate that most investors had expected to see. Net income of $420 million climbed 13% from the year-ago quarter, and after accounting for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges, adjusted earnings of $0.79 per share were $0.06 higher than the consensus forecast among investors.\nA closer look at Cognizant&apos;s business segments reveals that healthcare remained the most powerful force for overall growth. Revenue from healthcare soared 39% from the year-ago period, to $897 million, as it continues to catch-up to the larger financial services area. At $1.25 billion, sales from financial services were up a solid 18% from 2014&apos;s second quarter, with the manufacturing, retail, and logistics segment bringing up the rear with 12% year-over-year growth. Other sources of revenue saw a 20% boost.\nThe difference between the performance of Cognizant&apos;s North American and European operations once again made itself felt during the quarter. North American sales climbed by more than 25%, to $2.42 billion, but Europe&apos;s growth was limited to about 8%. Gains of 30% for Cognizant&apos;s rest-of-world segment were impressive, even though the IT consulting specialist gets relatively little revenue outside North America and Europe.\nCognizant&apos;s executives were impressed by the technology company&apos;s performance. CEO Francisco D&apos;Souza said: \"Our second-quarter sequential revenue increase in dollar terms was the strongest in our history. These results validate that our business strategy and our investments position us well to capture the emerging opportunities as clients look to transform into digital businesses.\"\nPresident Gordon Coburn noted Cognizant&apos;s progress internally toward its overall goals, pointing to efforts \"to optimize our existing services and aggressively invest in new services to enable clients to drive higher levels of operational efficiency.\"\nAnother brighter look at the year for CognizantAs we saw last quarter, Cognizant&apos;s strong results were accompanied by an increase in the company&apos;s guidance for the full 2015 fiscal year. The tech company boosted its revenue projections by $100 million, to $12.33 billion, and it made a $0.07-per-share increase to its calls for adjusted earnings per share, now expecting an even $3.00 per share for the full year."}

Trump said in January that he was shifting his business assets into a trust managed by his sons to eliminate potential conflicts of interests.\nBut D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) say Trump has broken many promises to keep separate his public duties and private business interests. For one, his son Eric Trump has said the president would continue to receive regular updates about his company\u2019s financial health.\nThe lawsuit, a signed copy of which Racine and Frosh provided to The Washington Post on Sunday night, alleges \u201cunprecedented constitutional violations\u201d by Trump. The suit says Trump\u2019s continued ownership of a global business empire has rendered the president \u201cdeeply enmeshed with a legion of foreign and domestic government actors\u201d and has undermined the integrity of the U.S. political system.\nThe suit could open a new front for Trump as he navigates investigations by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and congressional committees of possible collusion between his associates and the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nIf a federal judge allows the case to proceed, Racine and Frosh say, one of the first steps will be to demand through the discovery process copies of Trump\u2019s personal tax returns to gauge the extent of his foreign business dealings. That fight would most likely end up before the Supreme Court, the two said, with Trump\u2019s attorneys having to defend why the returns should remain private.\nRacine said he felt obligated to sue Trump in part because the Republican-controlled Congress has not taken the president\u2019s apparent conflicts seriously.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting in here to be the check and balance that it appears Congress is unwilling to be,\u201d he said.\nThe constitutional question D.C. and Maryland will put before a federal judge is whether Trump\u2019s business holdings amount to violations of parts of the Constitution known as the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses.\nIn another part of the Constitution, framers sought to prevent a president from favoring one state over another, forbidding him from receiving any gift or emolument from a state and, instead, only the compensation approved by Congress.\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, is the latest and most significant legal challenge to Trump over the issue of emoluments. The first was filed in January by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a D.C.-based watchdog group. In March, a D.C. restaurant sued Trump, alleging the new Trump International Hotel in D.C. benefits from unfair advantages because of its close association with the president. And last week, a group of Democratic members of Congress said they plan to file suit soon. Each, however, has faced legal hurdles over standing to sue the president.\nIn the Trump administration\u2019s most detailed response yet, the Department of Justice filed a 70-page legal brief on Friday arguing the CREW lawsuit should be dismissed. The administration said Trump\u2019s businesses are legally permitted to accept payments from foreign governments while he is in office.

Such a request would require extensive federal review, major changes to Yellowstone policies, and congressional action to modify a founding law that banned hunting or killing of buffalo and other wildlife there.\nThe prospect of hunting any of the 4,000 buffalo within Yellowstone boundaries is strongly opposed by animal advocates, who decry an existing culling program that allows hundreds of bison to be hunted and shipped to slaughter annually.\n\"Yellowstone is against any proposal to hunt in the park,\" said David Hallac, chief of the Yellowstone Center for Resources, the park's science and research branch.\nWhitman said the tribe would not force the issue by violating any of the park's regulations but may seek to broach the topic with the U.S. Interior Department, which oversees the national park system, or perhaps lobby Congress \"to request those changes be made\".\nManagement of Yellowstone bison has stirred controversy for decades. Killing of animals that wander into Montana in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem's carrying capacity, Yellowstone officials said.\nThe culling is also designed to ease the worries of Montana ranchers who fear bison will transmit the cattle disease brucellosis, which can cause animals to miscarry, to cows that graze near the park.\nThat could put into jeopardy Montana's brucellosis-free status, which allows ranchers to ship livestock across state lines without testing.\nMarty Zaluski, Montana state veterinarian and member of a state, federal and tribal team that manages bison in and around Yellowstone, is a proponent of hunting in the park and told Reuters in February it needed to be \"looked at more seriously as a possible solution\".\nHe said it would bring the herd closer to a population target of 3,000 to 3,500 and lessen the public outcry tied to slaughter of wayward buffalo.\nBut Yellowstone's Hallac contends that hunting in the park, which draws 3 million visitors a year because of tourist attractions such as the Old Faithful geyser and the bison, would further complicate matters.\n\"Even a proposal to hunt in the park causes more problems than the dilemma"}

It converted the bitcoins into dollars for the buyer. Given that bitcoin's value is a moving target day to day, the risk was all on the buyer side. The seller agreed to a fixed price in dollars.\n\"We found that on the day of the closing, we were kind of watching it [bitcoin's value] through the day,\" said Kuper. \"The timing actually ended up perfect for the exchange, very well for our client, so there was really no hesitation, no need to postpone.\"\nKuper said the client got a \"very fair\" exchange rate, though he could imagine how it could've been more volatile.

It\u2019s flooding our streets and basements, and washing our land and property away.\nSimply stated, when it rains, runoff from hard surfaces like rooftops, parking lots, streets and even lawns is shuttled to the nearest river or stream, often by underground pipes. Along the way, things like motor oil, pet waste, lawn chemicals and fertilizers, cigarette butts and garbage, to name just a few, hitch a ride.\nWith intense rainfall like we saw so much of last year, the sheer volume of water in those pipes \u2014 some of which haven\u2019t been maintained or updated for 25, 50, even 100 years \u2014 hits our streams hard and fast. It literally blows them out of their banks, causing flooding to roads, downtowns and commercial areas.\nTo make matters worse, in many older communities, stormwater is combined with raw sewage and when heavy rains overwhelm the system, it often means the combined, untreated waste is discharged to the nearest river or stream.\nScientific studies by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection have found that this polluted runoff results in over 3,000 miles of streams, like Solomon\u2019s Creek, Sugar Notch Run and Gardner Creek, to name a few, as damaged because they have too much pollution and as a result, too little aquatic life.\nWe\u2019ve also failed to adequately communicate that there are cost-effective solutions to help address this problem. Solutions that not only reduce pollution and nuisance flooding, but can also help beautify and revitalize communities.\nIt\u2019s all about replicating nature with things like street trees, streamside forests, specially designed flower beds called rain gardens, vegetated rooftops, and even porous pavement.\nTo help revitalize stormwater infrastructure, roughly 1,600 governments across the United States, including 12 in Pennsylvania, have chosen to establish reasonable stormwater fees. Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Derry and Hampden townships have instituted polluted runoff fees, so that residents can be part of the local solution. Many others are considering it.\nRegional approaches, like the 32-municipality Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority\u2019s Regional Stormwater Management Program, can offer cost savings that individual municipalities often wouldn\u2019t be able to realize. Similar multi-municipal authorities are either in place or under active exploration in Blair, York and Lebanon counties.\nMost programs offer customers discounts on fees by doing things on their property to reduce the amount of runoff.\nPassed by Congress in the 1990s as part of updates to the national Clean Water Act, and launched in 2003, having to manage polluted runoff from certain sized urban and suburban areas is not new. But as scientific understanding has grown, so have more specific requirements to reduce this pollution to local streams and the Chesapeake Bay.\nAlthough many are apt to point the finger at the Chesapeake Bay, let\u2019s be clear \u2014 local investments in clean water pay dividends first and foremost locally.\nBy updating our infrastructure for the 21st century, our communities, cultural heritage and even economy will benefit from cleaner, healthier"}

Funding from Mendon would increase 14.95 percent from $6.2 million to $7.13 million.\nThe rest of the education revenue would come from the state and other sources.\nFernandes said he was \"optimistic\" that both towns will provide the needed funding. School officials did not identify where it would come from.\nUpton officials have previously looked toward the town's school stabilization account as a possible funding source. Officials from Mendon have discussed a possible Proposition 2 1/2 property tax override.\n\"We're not asking the towns how they're going to get there,\" said School Committee Vice Chairwoman Heather Applegate. \"We're not asking for any more specifics on how the administration is going to use resources.\n\"Right now the School Committee is charged with voting on our final budget request,\" she said.\nApplegate said the district has pursued several cost-saving measures in recent years, including sharing costs with other districts, increasing energy efficiency and acquiring grants.\nThe district has also cut 57 teachers, cut programs and eliminated funding for athletics and other student activities.\nApplegate proposed adding a new behavioral program that would cost about $140,000 and include an adjustment counselor, a dual certified special education/general education teacher and two aides. She said such a program could reduce special education costs by keeping students within the district and possibly attracting students from nearby towns.\nUpton resident Michelle Goodwin said she appreciated school officials' optimism in getting the needed funding.\n\"I'm glad it looks like it's going to go well this year,\" she said. \"However I would like to see the real picture. What are we talking about for loss of teachers, other staff, class sizes, etc.?\"\nFernandes said the level-service budget maintains what the school district currently has.\nIf there is no funding to offset the $1.2 million grant reduction, part of which was due to the end of federal stimulus funding and part was from a separate federal Education Jobs Bill, the district would face staff reductions similar to last year's 33.25 positions cut. Class sizes would increase to the high 20s or low 30s.\nThe proposed budget does not include any increases to the Spanish immersion program, said Fernandes, who noted that the School Committee will soon discuss whether to open up the School Choice program, in which students go to a school in a different town, to kindergartners.\nKelly Carey of Upton said there are many parents whose children are not in the Spanish immersion program and feel left out,"}

Over the last four years, he has carefully managed his diabetes by lowering his blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol with diet, exercise and medication.\nTo keep on track, Mr. Calderaro visits his doctor, attends meetings for diabetes patients and gets frequent calls from a health counselor. It is a team effort, orchestrated by the Marshfield Clinic here. And it is animated by technology, starting with Mr. Calderaro\u2019s computerized patient record \u2014 a continuously updated document that includes his health history, medications, lab tests, treatment guidelines and doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 notes.\nTo visit the Marshfield Clinic, a longtime innovator in health information technology, is to glimpse medicine\u2019s digital future. Across the national spectrum of health care politics there is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age, the way Marshfield and some other health systems have already done, is essential to improving care and curbing costs.\nA paper record is a passive, historical document. An electronic health record can be a vibrant tool that reminds and advises doctors. It can hold information on a patient\u2019s visits, treatments and conditions, going back years, even decades. It can be summoned with a mouse click, not hidden in a file drawer in a remote location and thus useless in medical emergencies.\nModern computerized systems have links to online information on best practices, treatment recommendations and harmful drug interactions. The potential benefits include fewer unnecessary tests, reduced medical errors and better care so patients are less likely to require costly treatment in hospitals.\nThe widespread adoption of electronic health records might also greatly increase evidence-based medicine. Each patient\u2019s records add to a real-time, ever-growing database of evidence showing what works and what does not. The goal is to harness health information from individuals and populations, share it across networks, sift it and analyze it to make the practice of medicine more of a science and less an art.\nThe Bush administration has left it mainly to advocacy and the private sector to introduce digital medicine. But President-elect Barack Obama apparently plans to make a sizable government commitment. During the campaign, Mr. Obama vowed to spend $50 billion over five years to spur the adoption of electronic health records and said recently that a program to accelerate their use would be part of his stimulus package.\nThe Marshfield Clinic, a large doctors\u2019 group in Wisconsin, shows that computerized records can indeed improve the quality and efficiency of medicine. Yet the Marshfield experience suggests that the digital record becomes truly useful only when patient information is mined to find patterns and answer questions: What treatments work best for particular categories of patients? What practices or procedures yield the best outcome?\nThe Marshfield Clinic \u201cunderstands that it\u2019s a system of improvement that technology makes possible that really matters, and the electronic health record itself is no silver bullet,\u201d said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, director of the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\nFor the Obama presidency and the administrations that follow it, the challenge will be to somehow link electronic medical islands into a network that begins to approach on a national scale what organizations like Marshfield have achieved regionally. Ideally, a lone physician in a rural community could tap into the national health information network and be as well informed on treatments and research for patients with certain conditions as a specialist at Marshfield.\nSome experts caution that such a broad capacity for record-sharing could take decades to achieve \u2014 if it"}

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has indicated that if the FCC were to choose Title II as its goal, the legal fight would take years, in his estimation. The ISPs are essentially making good on his fear.\nFCC officials are expected to vote on the proposal Thursday, after which the draft would be made public so people can finally see details of what Wheeler is proposing.\nAll told, the battle lines are arrayed for the coming scrap: Internet companies and activists against ISPs and lobbyists.

Ionis' technology allows compounds to be created that target and bind to RNA, which is what pumps out the proteins that cause diseases. Ionis' drugs can be used to reduce the amount of troublesome protein that end up in the body, thereby helping to treat the underlying disease.\nWhat's great about this technology is that Ionis can quickly churn out new drugs once a troublesome RNA target is identified. That has allowed the company to pack its pipeline full of dozens of drugs that are aimed a treating a wide range of diseases. That provides investors with multiple shots on goal.\nBeyond the broad pipeline, Ionis has been such a terrific investment over the last few years thanks to its ability to make believers out of other big pharma companies. Currently, the company boasts partnerships with Biogen, GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, AstraZeneca, Roche, and more. Better still, these partners have been willing to shower Ionis with huge up-front cash payments to get their hands on the company's technology, which has kept the company's cash burn rates quite low.\nLooking ahead, Ionis is nearing the finish line with three new drugs.

Although they serve as the main source of energy for your body, carbohydrates like potatoes are also the center of controversy because eating too many may contribute to weight gain. On the plus side, however, potatoes serve as an excellent source of potassium, vitamin C and fiber with no cholesterol and very little sodium.\nA medium-sized russet potato, weighing about 213 grams, contains only 11 milligrams of sodium. The same size white potato contains about three times the sodium, with 34 milligrams. A red potato of the same size contributes 38 milligrams to your daily intake. Although the sweet potato is not classified in the same vegetable family as the traditional potatoes mentioned above, many people consider it a potato and eat it in place of other types of potatoes. Sweet potatoes have 118 milligrams of sodium in the same 213-gram serving, which is still considered low in sodium.\nThe numbers 11 and 34 seem like low numbers, but how do we know what is a little or a lot of sodium in a food item? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sets guidelines for food labels. Any food that contains less than 5 milligrams of sodium per serving is classified as salt- or sodium-free. A food classified as very low sodium contains 35 milligrams of sodium or less per serving. Low-sodium foods must contain no more than 140 milligrams of sodium. Potatoes in their natural form -- meaning without any added salt, ingredients or dressings -- are considered low-sodium foods.\nSodium is a mineral found naturally in many foods, including fruits and vegetables. Your body needs some sodium to balance the amount of water in your cells and stimulate the production of nerve impulses and muscle contractions. The danger comes from consuming too much sodium. Although most healthy people can tolerate up to 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day without experiencing adverse effects, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans states that all adults can benefit from reducing their sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams per day or less. Eating foods naturally low in sodium, like potatoes, can help you meet this goal.\nAlthough potatoes contribute very little sodium to your daily intake, many foods prepared using potatoes are not low-sodium. French fries contain about 388 milligrams of sodium in each 100-gram serving, and mashed potatoes have as much as 485 milligrams in 1 cup.

Kerr said at the time that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join as a new member meaning it would not get the UK rebate on contributions, worth \u00a35.6 billion in 2017.\nIf the UK leaves the EU, however, \u2018this argument is irrelevant\u2019, Kerr says. However, he still believes financially Scotland is better off staying in the UK.\nKerr was scathing of how Britain carried out Brexit negotiations, saying it was not a \u2018good idea\u2019 to put Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox \u2018in charge\u2019. He believes Foreign Office officials should have played a central role but were cut out.\nHe said Brexiteer ministers \u2018didn\u2019t understand that [the 27 EU member states] would stick together, would stick up for Ireland, would defend the integrity of the single market. These were basic mistakes\u2019.\nRenegotiation on any deal is unlikely, he believes. \u2018I think the EU isn\u2019t going to make many changes to the deal,\u2019 he said.\nHe questioned whether \u2018politicians in London quite understand how fragile the situation is\u2019, and said the confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP made it difficult for a Prime Minister to appear an \u2018honest broker, if you\u2019re relying for your political survival on the support of one party which is very sectarian in its support\u2019.\nFear of social unrest should not prevent a second EU referendum, he added. \u2018The worst reason for not having a second referendum would be if we were frightened of right-wing populist gangs in the street,\u2019 said Kerr, who believes Conservative austerity policies helped fuel Brexit in \u2018left behind\u2019 areas."}
{"idx": "23812", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Looking to make data integration a routine task for end users rather than an expensive challenge for developers, Bedrock Data today launched a namesake cloud service through which data can be ingested and then exported out into any other data format.\nBedrock Data CEO John Marcus says the service is based on a proprietary data type developed by Bedrock. End users can import any document into the service, where it is then converted to the Bedrock data type. They can then choose to export that same data into any other document format. Furthermore, Marcus says the Bedrock Data service keeps track of updates to documents, which can be updated every five minutes.\nFresh off of raising just over another $3 million in funding, Marcus says the end goal is to turn data integration into a function that end users simply invoke, versus requiring organizations to spend months deploying integration platforms that very expensive developers can use to only connect specific applications on a point-to-point basis. In contrast, Marcus says pricing for the Bedrock Data service running on the Google Compute Engine service starts at $149 per month for 20,000 objects tracked.\nThe degree to which a service such as Bedrock Data will eliminate the need for professional development services remains to be seen. But it is apparent that many needs for data integration are never met, simply because most organizations perceive such projects as being too complex and expensive to undertake.\nPerhaps more troubling to the internal IT organization is the simple fact that many of the application development projects that make up their backlog involve relatively trivial amounts of data integration that might better be handled by a cloud service. Much like the rise of the \u201ccitizen developer,\u201d there\u2019s no doubt that the day of the \u201ccitizen integrator\u201d is also upon us. While some folks in IT might find that threatening, the hope is that rather than focusing on data integration so much, internal IT organizations will find much more compelling ways to add value to the business."}

First year student Jamie Everett, who is studying a BSc in Wildlife, Ecology and Conservation, worked with Peter Merchant, a volunteer with the Hawk and Owl Trust, to build a new box and a feeding table there. They are now waiting to see if the returning peregrines take up the new home.\n\u201cThe new box is exactly the same dimensions as the old one, has the same ledge and faces the same direction,\u201d said Mr Merchant, who monitors and rehabilitates peregrines for the Trust in Suffolk and north Essex.\nMr Merchant said a carcass of a gull had been found on the university rooftop, which suggests that peregrines have already been in the vicinity, although there isn\u2019t much time for the raptors to move in. He said the courting between male and female birds would be in \u201cfull swing\u201d by now with peregrines typically laying their eggs in late March.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve covered as many angles as we can and just hope that we have done enough [to attract them],\u201d he added.\nAccording to Dr Mark Bowler, a lecturer at the university, should the falcons take up residence Mr Everett will be involved in monitoring the box via a webcam and recording what the birds are eating to gain practical conservation experience for his studies. It would then form part of a series of projects the students are carrying out aimed at surveying urban wildlife - they are due to soon start a survey of mammals living within a mile radius of the university\u2019s Waterfront building.\nWhen it comes to peregrines, Mr Merchant said falcons in urban areas tend to lay more eggs than their counterparts in more wilder areas although the fledge rate tends to be same, as young birds in towns and cities face more dangers when they drop out of their nests.\nIn the Ipswich area there have been two pairs of peregrines: the pair on the Mill who tended to feed on feral pigeons and another pair at the Orwell Bridge, where young were first reared in 2008 \u2013 the first time peregrines had successfully bred in Suffolk in 200 years."}

Mr. Wolstenholme, who attempted to convince the soldiers to leave the UNRWA installation, was not only detained for over three hours and threatened with physical violence, but was handcuffed and blindfolded as well. .\nThis is the second time Israeli soldiers have forcefully entered the Jenin Project Office.

His grandson is former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor Hal Jackman. Rowell died in 1941 and trust funds from an anonymous benefactor keep the interfaith service going in his memory.

In large part because Wal-Mart wants to sell more organic food \u2014 and because of its size and power, Wal-Mart usually gets what it wants.\nAs the nation's largest grocery retailer, Wal-Mart has decided that offering more organic food will help modernize its image and broaden its appeal to urban and other upscale consumers. It has asked its large suppliers to help.\nWal-Mart's interest is expected to change organic food production in substantial ways.\nSome organic food advocates applaud the development, saying Wal-Mart's efforts will help expand the amount of land that is farmed organically and the quantities of organic food available to the public.\nBut others say the initiative will ultimately hurt organic farmers, will lower standards for the production of organic food and will undercut the environmental benefits of organic farming. And some nutritionists question the health benefits of the new organic products. \"It's better for the planet, but not from a nutritional standpoint,\" said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \"It's a ploy to be able to charge more for junk food.\"\nShoppers who have been buying organic food in steadily greater quantities consider it healthier and better for the environment. Organic food \u2014 whether produce, meat or grain \u2014 must be grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers and antibiotics. Then, before it is sold, the food cannot be treated with artificial preservatives, flavors or colors, among other things.\nWhen Wal-Mart sells organic food on a much broader scale, it will have to meet the same Agriculture Department requirements. But nutritionists say the health benefits of many of these new offerings are negligible.\nWal-Mart says it wants to democratize organic food, making products affordable for those who are reluctant to pay premiums of 20 percent to 30 percent. At a recent conference, its chief marketing officer, John Fleming, said the company intended to sell organic products for just 10 percent more than their conventional equivalents.\nFood industry analysts say that with its 2,000 supercenters and lower prices, Wal-Mart could soon be the nation's largest seller of organic products, surpassing Whole Foods. Already, it is the biggest seller of organic milk.\nWhile organic food is still just 2.4 percent of the overall food industry, it has been growing at least 15 percent a year for the last 10 years. Currently valued at $14 billion, the organic food business is expected to increase to $23 billion over the next three years, though that figure could rise further with Wal-Mart's push.\nHarvey Hartman, president of the Hartman Group, a consulting firm in Seattle that is working with Wal-Mart on its organic food initiatives, asserted: \"What Wal-Mart has done is legitimized the market. All these companies who thought organics was a niche product now realize that it has an opportunity to become a big business.\"\nKellogg and Kraft say they began working on organic Rice Krispies and organic macaroni and cheese before having conversations with Wal-Mart.

Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator said it was a waste of time.\nAmong those attending were Mayor Ollie Tyler and members of her staff, Shreveport Police Chief Alan Crump, Louisiana State Police Troop G Commander Steve Robinson, Jonathan Ponder of the City Marshal's Office and Prator.\nThe meeting was the second this month held by the Caddo Parish Commission's Long Range Planning Committee to discuss a city/parish crime initiative. The first meeting was not attended by representatives of the Shreveport Police Department.\nThe meeting also occurred in an election year for Shreveport mayor in which crime is shaping up as a major topic.\n\"This is how we come up with a plan,\" Commissioner Mario Chavez said as he called for teamwork. \"We have the smartest people in the room from the different agencies throwing out ideas.\"\nMost of the meeting was dedicated to Chavez and fellow Caddo Commissioners Steven Jackson and Lyndon B. Johnson talking with Crump about the department's crime stats and operations. Jackson is running for Shreveport mayor.\nMembers of the Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office, Louisiana State Police and the City Marshal's Office spoke only briefly at the end of the meeting.\n\"I know the citizens are out there crying that crime is up even if the stats say they are down,\" Chavez said. \"I see the perception in the community saying that crime is up and we need to do something. It's gotten to the point where they are looking at us.\"\nPrograms to combat crime city-wide on the front end were mentioned, including programs targeting young people who are under-employed or unemployed, summer programs and diversion programs.\nA possible solution proposed in the first meeting \u2014 having Caddo sheriff's deputies patrol southwest Shreveport and potentially using parish funds for deputy overtime \u2014 was mentioned a few times throughout Wednesday's meeting.\nChavez said Wednesday he was told that parish funds are not needed.\nCrump and Prator did not meet directly to discuss potential solutions before Wednesday's meeting, but members of their agencies did meet, Crump said.\nThe result of those earlier discussions was a multi-agency warrants operation conducted by Shreveport Police, the Caddo Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Shreveport City Marshal\u2019s Office, the Louisiana Department of Corrections Division of Probation and Parole and Louisiana State Police that netted 17 arrests. Ten of those arrests were for felony offenses.\nThe police department and sheriff's office also work together on task forces. The warrants operation was a way to see how the departments could increase their joint activity within the city.\n\"Our people will continue to communicate,\" Crump said. \"The warrants operation was the best thing we could come up with that would involve everybody and would have teams in the city.\"\nMany of the individuals who have warrants are also those committing crimes, the chief said, adding that arresting those people will stop some criminal activity.\nPrator said that the departments have been meeting and that his deputies currently do"}

Berkeley legend Betty Ann Webster died, disappointing all of us who believed she was immortal. I've wondered whether it's just a sign of aging; I'm just more likely to know sick people now. But four months ago I was only four months younger, and everybody was doing fine. And some of the recently sick people in my life are, sadly, way younger than I.\nIt's just my turn in the barrel of fear. I've heard the word \"stent\" used in conversation way too much recently. It gives me the jimjams; it gives everyone the jimjams.\nSo I talk to the afflicted, and almost always I say, \"Please let me know if there's anything I can do.\" It's a thing that people say. They say, \"I'm sorry for your loss,\" if an actual loss is involved - would that include amputations? They say, \"Everything happens for a reason,\" and then a large bolt of lightning turns them into a mound of charcoal, and a ghostly voice says, \"What have we learned from this experience?\"\nIt'd be great if, for once, when someone said, \"Please let me know if there's anything I can do,\" the other person said, \"Well, you could do the laundry. I just haven't gotten around to it, what with half my colon missing. And, look, could you go down to the Hall of Justice and pay this overdue parking ticket? Also, that's a nice coat - could I have it?\"\nBut sick people don't say that, because they know what you mean. You are helpless in the face of intimations of mortality, as we all are, and you wish to assert a common bond of humanity. But telling a sick person, \"I assert our common bond of humanity\" is just dopey, so you say the other thing, the time-honored formulation, the series of agreed-upon syllables.\n\"Let me know if there's anything I can do\" means that you are outside the circle of people who are expected to do something. I mean, if my daughter called and said she was going into the hospital, I wouldn't ask her if there was anything I could do. We'd deal in specifics and logistics. And I'd probably be there at the hospital, doing nothing in a supportive and meaningful way.\nI've seen people spend an awful long time in hospital waiting rooms. They want news. Of course, one person could await the news and use the miracle of the telephone to tell the others, but usually everyone stays around just in case. Usually people pretend to read magazines and walk the halls and check out the vending machines. I have some kind of sense memory of staring at a vending machine while being assaulted by waves of fear.\nThat probably would have happened if I'd run errands too, but then at least the errands would have been run.\nSometimes there are children to be played with. Playing with children in the lobby of a hospital is very high on the depressing recreations list. I've done that too, although I can't remember whose kids they were.\nI know there are people who sleep in hospital rooms with the patients. It's common; nurses bring in cots, and the close relative, parent or spouse or daughter (rarely son), spends the night, sleeping fitfully and feeling helpless. I'm not sure the answer to \"Please let me know if there's anything I can do\" is \"Could you sleep in the"}

But the announcement probably was just as significant for what the group left out.\nMeryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Daniel Day-Lewis and Jessica Chastain were among the surprising snubs of actors who had been on a roll this awards season with nominations from the Golden Globes and Critics\u2019 Choice Awards but were nowhere to be found in SAG\u2019s orbit. It is very rare for an actor not to be at least nominated by SAG and then go on to win the Oscar, but this year already is proving to be unpredictable so precedent certainly can be broken.\nWhat the actor union\u2019s 2,500 randomly chosen members of the SAG Nominating Committee did do is throw a life line to streamers Amazon and Netflix, which had some setbacks at earlier awards this season. After shockingly getting shut out by the Golden Globes (even though it has separate comedy categories), Amazon\u2019s The Big Sick rebounded in a big way with nominations for Outstanding Cast and Supporting Actress for Holly Hunter. And Netflix, which just has to love SAG, also landed its Mudbound ensemble in the Cast category as well as Supporting Actress for Mary J. Blige.\nTwo years ago, SAG nominated Netflix\u2019s first big attempt to break into the Oscar conversation in major categories by nominating Beasts of No Nation for Outstanding Cast, even though it really was just a two-hander, and awarding Idris Elba Best Supporting Actor. It went on to be ignored by Oscar, though, and Mudbound\u2019s significant showing today can give the controversial Netflix hope that maybe this is the year It can break through in Oscar categories other than for their documentaries. Blige certainly has to be on any Oscar short list after nailing SAG, Globe and Critics\u2019 Choice nominations.\nIt was also a big day for Universal\u2019s Get Out, which continues to defy the odds of its early-February release to score significant attention including a Cast and Lead Actor nom for star Daniel Kaluuya. The latter\u2019s inclusion over Hanks and Day-Lewis must have been particularly encouraging to the studio. And with Get Out, Mudbound, a Denzel Washington (last year\u2019s winner for Fences) nomination for Roman J. Israel, Esq., and diversity shown in noms for Downsizing\u2019s Hong Chau and the cast of Big Sick, fears that we might be headed to a return to #OscarsSoWhite this year look increasingly unwarranted.\nYou could explain the absence of The Post, Phantom Thread and Molly\u2019s Game and their actors Streep, Hanks, Day-Lewis and Chastain as due to the late -breaking nature of those Christmas releases, but remember that another late-year release, Hidden Figures, won the Cast award last year. But, as I often have said, SAG has ridiculous voting windows for this contest and actually sent out ballots a month ago, so it puts later releases at a disadvantage if many members of the SAG Nom Comm chose the early voting option. Perhaps that explains why films that have been in the consciousness since Sundance such as Big Sick, Mudbound and Get Out could be helped by earlier awareness, while expected awards juggernauts, particularly Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Post, failed to make the cut.\nThat was the case with eventual Best Picture Oscar nominees such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Django Unch"}

{"idx": "23844", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: David Nwaba is a flyer for this week for those in need of SG help. Nwaba is technically the third-string shooting guard for the Bulls, but when Paul Zipser went down with a left foot injury, Nwaba was the man who picked up most of the minutes. Over his last two games, Nwaba has played like an All-Star, averaging 17.5 points and nine rebounds. Over his last four contests, Nwaba has shot 21 for 34, an outstanding .618 shooting percentage.\nHe is certainly a short-term add just for those who need the production at shooting guard, as Nwaba is likely to be relegated to the bench once Zipser comes back, which may be as soon as next week. But if Zipser's injury turns out to be more serious than currently believed, Nwaba should be a good roster add if he can keep up his great production.\nBeasley has been great lately for New York, averaging 16 points and eight rebounds per game over his last six. On top of that, he's shooting 42 percent from 3-point land, even if his volume from downtown isn't super high. With Kristaps Porzingis out for the season, Beasley has gotten starter minutes and a solid number of shots. The cupboard is pretty bare for New York right now, so don't expect that to change. They may give some younger guys some more minutes here soon, but they also traded a young big man in Willy Hernangomez, so it's not as if they have a ton of young talent in the front court chomping at the bit to get minutes. Beasley is a solid starting option in Fantasy right now.\nWith Marcus Smart now back for Boston, Rozier's minutes will take a hit. Smart has averaged 27 minutes in the two games he's played since returning, while Rozier has been closer to 20. Smart has also played quite well, making it tougher and tougher for Rozier to stand out in a crowded backcourt in Boston. He's still a key piece for the Celtics, but it's going to be tough for him to remain relevant in Fantasy with the whole Boston backcourt intact. He's a worthy stash in case the Celtics lose a guard at some point, but he should be kept on the bench for now.\nWith Tyson Chandler out with a neck injury, Alex Len has had a chance to get more minutes, and he has made the most of them. In his last three games, he has averaged a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds. He dominated on defense as well with more than two blocks per game. Alex Len has played fairly well all year, but he hasn't had a ton of opportunity, averaging less than 20 minutes per game. However, he has taken this opportunity and run with it.\nWith third-string center Alan Williams out for at least another month, and Chandler probably gone for another two weeks, Len is a good add for at least the next couple weeks. He might even be worth keeping on your roster after Chandler comes back, as Len's good play will probably net him more bench minutes. If not, he will be an easy drop, and owners won't regret the weeks of good production picked up in the meantime.\nCrawford may become a trendy name in Fantasy when Jimmy Butler went down with a knee injury, but Fantasy owners should tread carefully.

Leading consumer publishers are seeing ebook sales at 10-15 percent of total sales in January and February, driven by Christmas device sales.\nSo far ebooks had been strongest in niches: romance, business books and frequent travellers. They have now moved into the mass market: few genres will be untouched.\nThis shift brings with it a very different market structure, with Waterstones likely to shrink dramatically, technology companies with little stake in the health of publishing taking major roles and publishers faced with disintermediation and forced to build direct consumer relationships for the first time in their history.\nThis chart also illustrates, to me, the foolishness of spending all your time playing with apps and enhanced ebooks when those will only represent a tiny proportion of the publishing business. When cheap colour printing came in that didn\u2019t mean all novels had to be in colour, and the availability of apps doesn\u2019t mean everything has to be an app. The $50 coffee table book is not the publishing market, and the app that cost $500k to develop won\u2019t be either.\n\u00bb Benedict Evans is an analyst at Enders Analysis. This article was originally published at his blog and appears here with permission. The full report is available through Enders Analysis.\nThis article originally appeared in Enders Analysis.\nIt always is a great pleasure to apply a sharp prick to often inflated ebook statistics (\u201cdata from the AAP\u201d). The problem with including ebook sales within the AAP\u2019s monthly stats is this: ebook downloads are effectively direct-to-consumer whereas publishers\u2019 print numbers are overwhelmingly intermediated net shipments to retailers and wholesalers. Not only are print shipments substantially discounted (45-50%), they are reduced by the number of print returns that the publisher has received in the reporting period. Also they are subject to the cyclicality of trade publishers\u2019 calendar of new title releases. In Jan-Feb, publishers typically receive their heaviest returns (the post-holiday effect), but their frontlist releases are smaller and weaker on average. Ebook downloads spike during the same period, the result of initial downloads by those who have received ereaders as gifts over the holiday period. Conflating the two different types of sales is terribly misleading. They are apples and oranges in terms of providing an accurate measure of real consumer demand.\nIn the month of February, bricks-and-mortar bookstore sales as measured by the Census Bureau increased 9.3% from the preceding year, and for the two-month period are marginally down .5% to $3.33 billion. How does this square with the notion that ebook sales are destroying print numbers? It doesn\u2019t. Numerous consumer surveys of avid readers, both print and ebooks, indicate that such buyers are purchasing more books in both categories (http://versoadvertising.com/survey). The Jan-Feb numbers, if properly combined with ebook downloads, give a truer overall impression of real consumer demand, and would seem to support the consumer survey conclusions regarding emerging reading habits.\nPS.

Our courts have held that, to give proper informed consent, a patient must be informed of all material risks associated with the treatment.\nTo give proper informed consent, the patient must know, appreciate and, understand the nature and extent of the harm or risk.\nSmith performed a laparoscopic hernia repair on Beukes.\nShe sued him for damages, alleging that he had negligently failed to provide her with sufficient information which caused her to give an uninformed consent to laparoscopy during which her colon was perforated, and as a consequence of which she suffered complications and damages.\nPeople, generally, don't engage until they are confronted with a claim that isn't paid in full, says a medical scheme expert.\nBeukes lost in the Gauteng division of the high court in Pretoria. The appeal was against that judgment.\nAfter having consulted the referring doctor's report and radiological reports, Smith's recommendation was that the laparoscopy would be the best option for Beukes under the circumstances.\nThe laparoscopy was performed by Smith on February 23 , 2012. Beukes was discharged from hospital on 28 February 2012.\nThree days post-discharge, Beukes was re-admitted to hospital with complications associated with a perforated colon.\nShe underwent three further surgical procedures and was hospitalised until 19 April 2012.\nAccording to Smith, Beukes gave him informed consent orally on February 22 , 2012, after he had consulted with her and explained the nature of each of the two options available, being laparoscopic surgery and the laparotomy, and the material benefits and risks associated with each.\nHe had informed her that, in his opinion, the laparoscopy was the better option in the circumstances. He also testified that she had signed a written consent shortly before the operation on 23 February 2012 which formed part of the record.\nBeukes, on the other hand, denied that the doctor had explained both procedures to her.\nFortunately for Smith, the Appeal Court found no basis upon which to overturn the factual finding by the trial court that Smith's version was probable and that of Beukes was not.\nHowever, Smith was unfortunately subjected to lengthy cross-examination from which he might have been spared had there been a written or other recordal of his explanation, discussion and advice leading to the informed consent.\nKeeping record not only protects the patient which is primary.

{"idx": "23854", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: One of the reasons I love being a librarian is that I have an opportunity to do many different things as a part of my job. At the recent Geological Society of America conference I had a chance to wear many hats: advisor to an undergraduate giving a talk, librarian looking at possible books to purchase and strategies for teaching students about the scientific literature, editor of a society newsletter, and occasional instructor of an introductory geoscience course.\nOne of the recurring themes of this conference, no matter which hat I was wearing, was the need to make certain skills and concepts that are implicit to one group of folks much more concrete and explicit to another group of folks.\nThe Nature of Science. Dr. Lynn Marquez from Millersville University gave a great talk about teaching geoscience students about the nature of science. Scientists tend to have an innate sense of what is (and what isn't) science. Some of them are good at explaining this to others, some aren't. We understand what makes the scientific method work, and we believe that the best way to learn about science is to do science. But what about those students sitting in our large introductory lecture classes? In a class of 100 or more, often without a lab, can these students really learn about the nature of science by simply learning how plate tectonics works or by memorizing the different types of silicate minerals? Students may learn about what science has discovered, but do they really come away with a better knowledge of how the process works? Dr. Marquez argued convincingly that we need to make the nature of science more explicit in our introductory courses - we can't assume that students will simply pick it up over the course of a semester. She argued that this can be done without making drastic changes to our current lesson plans, too. We just need to talk about the process of science a bit more.\nInterestingly, my fellow SciAm blogger Doc Free Ride recently discussed the challenge of teaching students about the nature of science in a philosophy of science course that also (like our large lecture classes) doesn't have students actually doing science.\nData Management. I learned about several new geoscience data resources at GSA, and this underscores the increasing importance of high quality data management practices. Data that is made available on the web can be useless if it doesn't come with good metadata - that is, the stuff describing what the data actually is and how it was collected. Conversely, well described data can disappear forever if it only exists in print lab notebooks on a PIs bookshelf. Data management is one of those skills that is often not explicitly taught to our novice researchers (sometimes because their advisors aren't very good at it themselves). Funding agencies are starting to recognize the importance of good data management practices by requiring grant applicants to submit data management plans.\nInformation literacy. Part of being a good scientist is the ability to effectively communicate your research to others. Another part is knowing what other folks have already learned about your research area. Part of my job is to make this a bit more explicit to students. Taking the time to introduce students to different types of scientific literature, strategies for pulling together information, and ethical use of that information will make those students better prepared to communicate their science in the future. Importantly, they will be better prepared to think critically about the information they find on the web, because they will know what types of stuff they should be looking for.\nOf course, taking class time (even just a bit) to talk about these things means less class time is spent on the concepts and facts that make up a specific subject. Less subject content may be \"covered.\" I think the trade off"}

Being gratuitously cruel in casually murdering an already wounded policeman, they display a chilling depravity. As such, attacks like this are intolerable: they must be stopped, and therefore they must be understood.\nThe assassinations follow the random car-crash terrorism of December and the Syrian beheadings of November. All were perpetrated by young Muslim men. But what we are experiencing is not the product of a religion: it does not deserve to be so dignified. Rather, we are in the midst of a new culture of violence. Occasionally, throughout history, such cultures have perpetrated viciousness. Previous European excrescences have been fascism in 1930s Germany, and the Red Brigades in 1970s Italy. A culture of violence is a vile and self-perpetuating belief system, but it can be crushed.\nIn all societies, a significant minority of young men are hormonally predisposed to violence. A core task for a community is to restrain them by means of its culture. Over the centuries Europe\u2019s communities have succeeded so well that our region has become by far the most peaceful society that has ever been known. Yet against this background of peace, Europe\u2019s Muslim communities have manifestly failed to build sufficiently powerful cultural restraints.\nBehaviour of any group is described by a frequency distribution. The Muslim community must take responsibility not just for behaviour in the middle of the distribution, where Muslims are as peaceable as anyone else, but for behaviour at its tail. Those young men predisposed to violence have found in Islam a convenient norm which enables them to reconcile their desires with their conscience: killing infidels for Allah is justified. Of course, this is a misinterpretation of modern Islam, but it is evidently a feasible one. Violent youth are not able to find an equivalent misinterpretation in modern Christianity.\nMany of these young men from across Europe have gone to Syria to try to kill people. This is not even a political phenomenon, let alone a religious one. It is best thought of as \u2018conflict tourism\u2019: a real-life version of a video game. While humane youth with a sense of adventure go off to Africa to do good, violent youth go to Syria to posture with guns and pull besotted girls. This, I think, is why about a quarter of the young men who go to fight in Syria are converts. They are not exceptionally religious people driven by their faith into foreign violence: indeed, if they were, Islam as a faith would stand condemned. Rather, they are exceptionally self-indulgent people, needing to reconcile their lust for excitement with their conscience, and so adopting what they can mistake for Islamic norms.\nConflict tourism, like all tourism, has the triviality of entertainment. Yet it is evil because, like the worst form of colonialism, it lets foreigners with guns impose their lifestyles, uninvited, on others. A blond Swedish conflict tourist in Iraq is reported as saying, \u2018I\u2019m having the time of my life.\u2019 In the process, he is providing his Syrian victims with the time of their death.\nUnsurprisingly, Europe\u2019s conflict tourists are hated by their unwilling hosts.

As counter-intuitive as it might sound for those of us trained in the leadership model of the industrial era, iterating fast failures achieve a desired result faster than perfecting the solution.\nIn the complex digital revolution era, trying to predict, control, and eliminate variances is a losing game. Reducing variance inevitably meets the law of diminishing marginal returns: the cost of reducing variance eventually exceeds the benefit. In addition, the goal of controlling and minimizing variance can be deceptive, because we don\u2019t know what to measure in a complex environment that changes so rapidly, and we can\u2019t control what we can\u2019t measure. The minute we figure it out, what we need to measure has changed. For all these reasons, iteration instead of perfection is the more effective way to go.\nIn today\u2019s complex business environment, where things are changing constantly, speed of execution is a lot more important than perfect execution. While you\u2019re trying to perfect a certain solution or product, the situation might have changed already, rendering your product or solution irrelevant. Make it \u201cgood enough,\u201d ship it, improve it based on market feedback, rinse and repeat. This approach attains a solution much faster because of the snowball effect of iterative learning.\nRadical innovation happens when many self-organizing employees experiment profusely and learn. By learning, I mean they see how best to adapt to the environment and respond by adjusting their behavior incrementally but continually. The iterative adaptation based on these experiments builds momentum\u2014often well below the radar screen.\nIterations create positive autocatalytic feedback loops. In these positive feedback loops, any action taken by one agent is amplified by the positive feedback within the loop, similar to compound interest on your savings. Every interest payment adds to the principal, propelling even greater interest on the next payment and producing exponential growth. The constant interplay between feedback from the market and adaptation of features, products, and marketing provides a much greater impact during the same period than refining close to perfection (the snowball effect). This is how speed translates into quality.\nThe process of rapid iterative experimentation builds an autocatalytic momentum that can catapult into a huge social phenomenon or radical innovation. Radical innovations are marked by the exponential growth of fluctuations (errors, failures, or diversities). These random perturbations include unexpected challenges from the environment, failures in our efforts, and sparks of diversity of thoughts among team members. Each iteration of profuse experimentation adds momentum toward radical innovation.\nBecause of the autocatalytic nature of complex systems, a small change in how simple rules are implemented among employees at the local level dramatically changes how global patterns appear at the organizational level.\nA positive-feedback loop that creates amplification during the iterative process is particularly applicable in the information technology industry. Some IT tools not only serve their originally-intended purpose but create an explosion of new software and programming platforms, stimulating breakthrough ideas and opening doors for even more innovations. Users discover unintended ways to employ these tools, spawning a whole new ecosystem. These tools also open doors for the \u201cadjacent possible,\u201d the term coined by Stuart Kauffman and expounded on by Steven Johnson that refers to the area of possibility for innovation.\nA hallmark sign of today\u2019s effective leaders is his or her ability to unlearn old habits and change their mind when presented with convincing evidence. For example, people are used to a culture that doesn\u2019t tolerate failure, but failure is an essential ingredient for radical innovation."}

It\u2019s something that\u2019s far too distant in the future until, suddenly; it smacks us in the face.\nMore and more people around the country are not preparing adequately for retirement. It means there are some huge problems and the overall consequence is that most people just won\u2019t be able to live their final years with nearly as much money as they need.\nThis is the reason behind today\u2019s post. Let\u2019s now take a look at how you can plan effectively for retirement, and ensure you aren\u2019t left behind.\nOne of the big reasons why people run out of money during retirement is because they don\u2019t think what will happen after it. In other words, they might budget for general living expenses, but what about those big purchases?\nWhen we talk about big purchases post-retirement, we\u2019re certainly not referring to new televisions. Instead, this is where you really start to mature, and think about the potential funeral costs your family might have to soak up, as well as the cost for any elderly care that you or your significant other might require.\nIn other words, make provisions beforehand and don\u2019t leave the pot empty.\nWhen you get your first job, a pension is the last thing on your mind. It\u2019s regarded as more of an inconvenience; something that eats away at your low starting salary.\nUnfortunately, this creates a problem later on. It means that you effectively don\u2019t have as much time to save money, and the obvious result is that you don\u2019t have enough when the time does come to retire. This is one of the reasons why the retirement age in so many countries is on the rise.\nAs such, make sure your pension contributions are in order right from the start. If you know that you aren\u2019t saving enough, now is the time to do something about it. Simply assuming that the government \u201cwill\u201d look after to you isn\u2019t enough in these cases; the last thing you want is to be left with a limited way of living for your final years.\nOne of the biggest mistakes that a lot of people approach retirement with is that they think they won\u2019t spend as much money. This is usually because they have accumulated all of their big possessions, like a house and car, and as a result supposedly don\u2019t need to acquire many other things.\nUnfortunately, this is seldom the case. You\u2019ll have more time on your hands and as a result, you\u2019ll be spending just as much money. In fact, if you have children and grandchildren, there\u2019s every chance that you might be spending even more money than you do currently, which is again why pension contributions from a young age are so important."}

Ehren Kruger (Transformers, Ghost in the Shell) wrote the screenplay.\nFrom reviews that were collected on Tuesday morning, the film currently carries a 48 percent critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney recognizes the risk associated with remaking a well-loved childhood gem, noting that Burton's track record for \"summoning genuine emotion is patchy at best.\" He calls the picture \"frustratingly uneven,\" with a \"cluttered screenplay\" and \"thin characters that fail to exert much of a hold.\" Rooney writes that up until the end of the film, \"the filmmaker's overstuffed visual imagination and appetite for sinister gloom all but trample the enchantment of a tale that, at heart, is simple and whimsical.\"\nWith regard to the screenplay, Rooney claims that a misstep was made in revealing the magical element of Dumbo's flight capabilities \u2014 his oversized ears that double as wings \u2014 too early, allowing for no build-up or surprise. He recognizes that there are many positive elements of the film, from production design to period costumes and gorgeous visuals, though he concludes that ultimately, Dumbo fails to tug at the heartstrings.\nFor Rolling Stone, Peter Travers highlights the work of character designer Michael Kutsche by noting that the \"computerized Dumbo is a marvel of cuteness and technical wizardry who steals every scene he's in.\" He suggests that the gold standard of this work is undermined by the overcomplicated and predictable script. The critic goes on to praise the cinematography, production design, costumes and musical composition, but decides that the simple, sweet and safe tale fits Burton like a glove \u2014 too well.\nIn the Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips notes that the film offers \"less\" of many things that the original had, such as wit, charm and songs. He offers a particular criticism of the writer, saying, \"Over and over, the movie strands its central, dewy-eyed, flappy-eared pachyderm in a series of unfortunate narrative events dreamed up by screenwriter Ehren Kruger. The writer has been miscast. He brings the same light touch and airy whimsy he brought to three Transformers pictures.\" Phillips gives Dumbo 1.5 stars and ends with a hopeful look forward to the upcoming Aladdin and Lion King remakes.\nMashable's Angie Han writes that the elephant is actually a supporting player in a jumble of interrelated storylines \u2014 such as a dad disappointing his children and a small business struggling in an industry dominated by big businesses, \u2014 but as the critic notes, those plot lines \"never really take off.\" Han argues that none of the characters seem like real people, and that the film doesn't work as a whole, rather as a collection of \"odd little moments.\" She praises Burton's depiction of Dreamland"}

Like many couples, they're struggling in this economy, but they're managing.\nThey've learned to live without life's little luxuries, things like health insurance. Still, they count themselves fortunate. They, at least, were able to buy their daughter health-care coverage through KidsCare.\nThen, Dianne got sick this summer and along came the state of Arizona with nine of the most terrifying words in the English language: We're from the government, and we're here to help.\nNow 7-year-old Sierra McKeen is about to be kicked to the health-care curb.\nThis, to help balance the state budget - never mind that three-quarters of the money to fund the program comes from the feds.\nDianne and Patrick are like many Arizonans. He was laid off two years ago and hasn't been able to find work. She works for a small video-production company that doesn't offer insurance. Her income is too high to qualify for the state's health-care plan for the poor, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. But it's low enough that the couple could enroll Sierra in KidsCare, paying a $50 monthly premium.\nEverything was fine until June, when Dianne was hospitalized with pneumonia and valley fever, and a state Department of Economic Security caseworker showed up at her bedside, AHCCCS application in hand. Dianne says she told the caseworker that she wouldn't qualify for AHCCCS given her income, but the caseworker, she says, insisted that she apply.\n\"Because I didn't have insurance, they made me fill out an AHCCCS application,\" she said. \"I told them this is for me only. It's not for anybody else in my family. It's certainly not for my daughter because she's on KidsCare.\"\nOn the day of her release from the hospital, Dianne got a letter saying she'd been approved for AHCCCS, under a \"spend-down\" program that takes into account your medical bills.\nWhat no one told her - until it was too late, that is - was that her stint on AHCCCS would be temporary. And that once she was on AHCCCS, her family would also be put on AHCCCS. And that once Sierra was on AHCCCS, she'd be taken off KidsCare. And that once their AHCCCS expired, Sierra would have to go on a waiting list to get back on KidsCare.\nThey also didn't mention that the term \"waiting list\" is a tad misleading, because it's a wait that never ends. By decree of the Legislature and Gov. Jan Brewer, KidsCare is frozen. In January, 40,000 kids were covered. Now there are 27,000 - with an estimated 50,000 eligible children on the so-called waiting list.\nMake that 50,001 come Nov. 30, when the McKeens' AHCCCS is set to expire. While it could be extended, that's not likely given the requirements of the spend-down program.\nDianne is livid, and understandably so.\n\"If I had been told at any point through any of this that my daughter was going to lose her KidsCare, I would have refused to apply,\" she said. \"I would have paid $50 a month for the rest"}

However, three issues -- the nation's economy, the size and power of the federal government, and the moral and ethical climate in the country -- fit both of these unwelcome criteria.\nAmericans' satisfaction with the state of the nation's economy has dropped by 23 percentage points since January 2008 to 13%, according to a Jan. 5-8 Gallup poll. These figures represent both the lowest rate of satisfaction and the biggest decline seen for any of 24 issues measured in the survey. Attitudes toward the moral and ethical climate and the size and power of the federal government are similar to each other. Slightly fewer than 3 in 10 Americans are satisfied with each, down from about 4 in 10 in 2008, the last presidential election year and the last time Gallup measured satisfaction on all 24 items.\nSee page 2 for a ranking of all 24 items.\nAmericans' satisfaction with the size and power of government has declined fairly steadily since January 2002, just months after 9/11 and at a time when Americans were positive about most things relating to the government. Confidence in the economy has dropped sharply since 2008 after fluctuating between 2002 and 2007. Confidence in the moral and ethical climate was flat through January 2008, before falling to the new low.\nMost Americans today are also dissatisfied with the level of immigration into the U.S. and with the nation's efforts to deal with poverty; however, these views haven't changed much in recent years.\nOn the positive end of things, Americans are the most satisfied with the overall quality of life in the U.S. as well as with two major aspects of U.S. national security: the nation's security from terrorism and the nation's military strength and preparedness. Satisfaction with security from terrorism is up 14 points since 2008, while satisfaction has held steady in the other two areas.\nAt least half of Americans are also satisfied with the influence of organized religion, the opportunity to get ahead through hard work, the state of race relations, the quality of the environment, the nation's gun laws, and the nation's policies to reduce or control crime.\nSatisfaction has been stable on all of these except satisfaction with the opportunity to get ahead through hard work, which has fallen 15 points since 2008, paralleling the sharp decline in satisfaction with the economy.\nThat leaves 10 issues in the poll about which Americans show tepid satisfaction, varying from 30% to 42%. Net dissatisfaction (the percentage satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied) is particularly high for the size and influence of major corporations, the availability of affordable healthcare, the amount Americans pay in taxes, and \"our system of government and how it works.\"\nThis is Gallup's first update of all 24 issues since January 2008, after previously tracking the question annually since 2001.

{"idx": "23877", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: MIAMI (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Thursday it will not proceed with a $24 billion nuclear power project in central Florida because of licensing delays and doubts about cost recovery, but may use the site for nuclear power generation in the future.\nThe announcement was the latest blow to nuclear power investment in the Sunshine State and reflected the boom in natural gas development nationwide.\nAlthough it is pulling the plug on plans to build a nuclear plant in Florida's Levy County, the company said it continues to regard the Gulf Coast site as a \"viable option for future nuclear generation.\"\n\"We continue to believe that a balanced energy portfolio, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and state-of-the-art cleaner power plants are critical to securing Florida's energy future,\" Alex Glenn, president of Duke Energy's utility operations in the state, said in a statement.\nHe cited delays in the licensing of new plants by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as uncertainties about cost recovery, as among leading reasons plans to build the plant had been put on hold.\n\"Nuclear energy should remain an option to meet Florida's future energy needs,\" said Glenn.\nDuke Energy Florida provides electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in Florida.\nDuke Energy, the biggest power company in the United States, announced in February that its Progress Energy Florida utility would retire the Crystal River nuclear plant on the state's west coast.\nThe plant had been offline since late 2009 due to damage done to the reactor's containment structure during a power upgrade and the replacement of the unit's steam generators.\nThe Levy project decision was welcomed by critics of nuclear energy in Florida. \"Duke's leadership has taken a fresh look at these unnecessary nuclear projects and has absolutely made the right decision for Florida consumers,\" said Stephen A. Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.\n\"While important details are still being resolved, Florida consumers should rejoice in knowing that the fleecing associated with this nuclear project will end,\" he added, noting that the Levy project cost had \"skyrocketed.\"\nDuke said it will continue the process to obtain a license to build the plant, but in the meantime it plans to seek to construct or acquire natural gas-fired power generation.\n\"It is encouraging to see Duke recognize the value of nuclear energy by keeping its options open for this site,\" said Jerry Paul, a Florida-based nuclear engineer with the Energy Information Institute. \"Most experts would agree that zero-emission nuclear energy must play a role in America's and Florida's future energy supply,\" he added.\nPaul said the Levy decision appeared to be based on a narrow set of factors related to Duke's Florida territory, including electricity demand projections and the timeline for available energy from that plant compared with the delays in the permitting process.\nThere are currently 100 reactors licensed to operate in the United States. The reactors have a total capacity of about 97,843 megawatts (MW) and generate about 20 percent of the nation's power.\nIn February Duke said it was evaluating the potential to build a new gas plant that could come online as early as 2018.\nIn 2012, before the merger with Duke, Progress said it delayed the proposed in-service date for the Levy county nuclear power plant to 2024 with a second unit following 18 months later. The company also boosted the cost estimate for the 2,200-MW project to between $19 billion and $24 billion."}

They have also approached the Lake County Commission and state officials.\nBut Ted and Vickie Miller, who live directly next door to the five-acre operation, say they can barely stand being there any longer. They say they are getting headaches and are constantly feeling stressed and aggravated from lack of sleep, and nobody seems to be able to do anything.\n\u201cIt\u2019s destroying my whole life,\u201d Ted Miller said.\nThe Millers hosted a community meeting in their backyard recently and discovered they\u2019re not the only ones with concerns and that noise is not the only problem. About 30 people showed up.\nJeanine Shawley, who lives a half mile down the road, said she is also bothered by the noise but others say they are more concerned with bright lights glaring onto the road at night and in the early morning hours and increased truck traffic on an already busy two-lane road.\nJennifer Cline said she has seen semi trucks entering or leaving the facility block buses at a school bus stop across the street.\nSome of those neighbors, wearing \"Stop the Noise\" T-shirts, attended a Lake County Commission meeting last week to voice their concerns.\n\"I'd like to ask each and every one of you if you would be OK living next to this,\" Miller asked the board Tuesday. \"Well, I'm not. It's driving me crazy. This is not normal agricultural activity.\"\nMedMen spokesman Daniel Yi said they are aware of the concerns and have taken steps to reduce the noise. They added silencers around the dehumidifiers, which generate most of the noise, and added wooden walls along some of the outer edges of the property to buffer the noise.\nYi said by June 1 they plan to install vinyl insulation blankets and enclosed air conditioning units to ensure they don\u2019t add to the noise levels.\nYi said they are also working on ways to address lighting. And he said MedMen did experience higher than usual traffic during the months they were upgrading the facility, but it should be considerably lower going forward.\nYi also said the company understands that Treadwell Nursery, the medical marijuana farm they purchased last year, was quieter but said it\u2019s because they used open-air greenhouses and fans. MedMen upgraded the facility with climate-controlled Dutch-style greenhouses to reduce humidity levels and produce better quality and safer products, so they are doing what they can to reduce noise levels because they are admittedly louder.\nBut neighbors say the only real solution is for the county to amend their ordinances to regulate the noise, lights and traffic.\nMiller said he's talked to the Florida Department of Health's Medical Marijuana Use department and received confirmation that counties can enforce noise ordinances with specific provisions.\nLake County Commission Chairwoman Leslie Campione said the county may consider that.

We intend to further increase spending not only by accelerating existing projects but also by spending on additional projects allowed by the available fiscal space brought about by significant savings we have attained,\" Abad said.\nAbad said the government expected that slower disbursements would have added to the external factors that mainly dampened economic growth in the first two quarters.\nHe noted that the disasters that struck Japan, the slow recovery of the US and European economies, as well as the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa resulted in higher fuel and transport prices, lower demand for exports and reduced incomes of overseas Filipino workers.\nThe budget chief said the additional projects being considered for the remainder of 2011 include the hiring of nurses and healthcare workers; rural electrification projects; infrastructure for agrarian reform; aquaculture support; on-site housing and resettlement; local roads connecting to national roads; farm-to-market roads and additional national roads and bridges.\nTo further enhance the job-generating capacity of the economy, the government is also looking at additional funding for the development of human resources needed by priority industries. For instance, the government is already in talks with the business process outsourcing industry in forging a partnership for a joint human resource development endeavor.\nAbad said aside from speeding up public spending, the government will focus on containing the inflation rate within 3-5 percent; further improving business confidence that rose to 34.1 percent in the third quarter from 31.8 percent in the second quarter; building on the agriculture sector\u2019s remarkable growth; and diversifying domestic and external trade, including taking advantage of opportunities with fast-growing economies in Southeast Asia.\nPlanning Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said public construction and government services are likely to pick up due to the accelerated spending plan of government implementing agencies and the DBM for the rest of the year.\n\"We want to optimize fiscal spending\u2019s contribution to growth.

And all this because of who Mumia is.\nYou\u2019ll find that they\u2019re not all \u201cself-described (\u2018ill-informed\u2019) anarchists who \u2026 have boonswangled the rest of the world into believing Abu-Jamal is a political prisoner,\u201d as one man suggested.\nYou may believe you already know these \u201cflaky\u201d young \u201ccult-groupies,\u201d who\u2019ve decided to \u201csubmit\u201d to Clark Kissinger, MOVE, or Mumia, but I dare say they\u2019re not the monolith that mainstream media (including you) have made them out to be. The people who support Mumia range from those who are simply against the death penalty and maybe don\u2019t feel the need to know every piece of evidence or memorize every witness, to those who see the travesty of his trial like you, to people who don\u2019t care about guilt or innocence and believe he ought to be out on the streets just because he\u2019s a revolutionary. You could ask many of these kids if they think Mumia\u2019s innocent and they may give the same answer you did \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And that\u2019s precisely why they\u2019ve dedicated their time to fighting the execution.\nAs a link to the spirit of the 1960s, Mumia represents the possibility for change and the role of youth in that change. From middle-class kids in the suburbs to kids who face police harassment everyday in the city \u2014 we all see our futures wrapped up in his for many reasons, but basically\u2013 if they can execute Mumia on the flimsiness of his trial, what will it mean for us? If his politics can be used against him, what precedents will that set for us?\nThis proves my point. I find very little appealing about mobilizing anyone \u2014 young or old \u2014 around the case of one individual whose innocence is dubious.\nFor the umpteenth time I will repeat that Mumia got a bad trial. That makes him legally innocent. But not morally. I am pleased that Mumia has one of the best"}

Like all the recent years before it, 2011 figures to bring new and interesting developments to computer security.\nWriters like me get lots of pitches for predictions this time of year. I'm going to filter and edit them and throw in a bit of my own to give you the Best of What To Expect In Security in 2011 and a few bogus calls too.\nMicrosoft and others have for years been observing and noting a general decline in the number of vulnerability disclosures, but this year Microsoft's vulnerability patch count actually went up a bit. They attributed this to an increase in outside-reported vulnerabilities, which translates to output from bug bounty programs and, perhaps, to Microsoft's productivity in patching. It still seems basically like a blip and the overall trend of decrease should continue, especially as old versions of software end their lifecycles.\nMalware Will Increasingly Use Stolen Digital Certificates to Bypass Whitelisting and Code Signing Requirements--There's something to this, but not a whole lot. The \"trend\" is based on two bad examples. The first, Stuxnet, involved 2 legitimate certificates where the genuine private keys had been stolen, perhaps through physical theft. The second was a version of Zeus where Kaspersky's certificate was attached to the executable, but it wasn't genuinely signed so the hash didn't match and the file generated conspicious errors. Stuxnet is not a trend, it's sui generis and such private key theft is beyond the capabilities of all but a very small number of malware writers. Any idiot can do the Stuxnet trick and they look idiotic doing it.\nExploding Smartphone Market and Growing Tablet Demand Lead to More Mobile Malware--\"The year of mobile malware\" has actually reached running joke status in the computer business. Not that the prediction doesn't make sense, it does. But it made sense last year and the year before that and... you get the idea. M86 cites examples from this year and they're good ones, but they're not the explosion that's been predicted every year for the last 7 or 8.\nSymantec made a series of predictions in various fields of security.\nSpam will become more global--The population with Internet access in places like Brazil is getting so large that English will fall below 90% of spam. The growth of spam from developing nations will also grow.\nCybercriminals Usurp URL Shortening Services--This is not completely new of course, but Symantec says attackers will get more ambitious and perhaps take over an entire service, abusing link results.\nHackers Exploit Router Vulnerabilities--They expect to see malware abusing known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing routers. Why now? They don't say.\nRogue Marketplace Vendors Exploit Online Digital Currencies--Symantec says that social networkig sites will introduce virtual currencies, a la gaming sites. The obvious result will be scams and black market trading of the currencies.\nMaking Web Security Work in an Era of Pervasive Threats--Businesses will have to create more and more granular security policies to deal with the necessity of business access to social networking and other potentially dangerous sites.\nIncreased Global Collaborative Takedowns--Fortinet also predicts an increase in coordinated efforts to take down botnets and other organized Internet crimes."}

It is one of the grounds you look forward to playing at, it is a great ground, and it will be nice to have the fans on my side rather than against me there for once.\n\u201cA few years ago when the current manager (Keates) was playing for Wrexham, they had a really strong side. Then it never used to be a good outcome for us. They were always close games mind, but Wrexham always found a way to win, so it was never good through that period for me.\n\u201cHopefully I can make some more happier memories now that I have signed for them.\nRoberts will enjoy his first training session with Wrexham on Friday ahead of Saturday\u2019s sixth game of pre-season for the Dragons as they travel to the Weaver Stadium to take on Nantwich Town.\nThe 27-year-old is relishing the chance to get back into full-time football after enjoying three seasons with the Shaymen, culminating with promotion back to the National League last term via the play-offs.\nRoberts has been impressed by the quality of the squad Keates has assembled during the summer.\n\u201cAfter a bid came in from Wrexham to Halifax, I made the decision that I\u2019d like to pursue it. The two clubs came to an agreement then and I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThere were a lot of reasons, getting back to full-time football was a bonus.

{"idx": "23897", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: France's new president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has put the German chancellor on the defensive with his growth agenda. Now Angela Merkel is planning to strike back. She is calling for structural reforms to save the euro with a six-point plan aimed at harmonizing austerity and growth in Europe once again.\nThe more European leaders talked at a dinner last Wednesday, the grimmer Angela Merkel looked. One after another, they spoke out in favor of the joint assumption of debt and against the strict austerity course Berlin is calling for. The chancellor stared silently at the man who was responsible for this change of mood -- France's new president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who noted with satisfaction that there was \"an outlook for euro bonds in Europe.\"\nMerkel disagreed, saying that euro bonds are not the right tool, but to no avail. Only a minority stood behind the German leader. Even European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said, at the end of the dinner, that there should be \"no taboos,\" and that he would examine the idea of euro bonds. \"Herman,\" Merkel blurted out, \"you should at least say that some at this table are of a different opinion.\"\nMerkel's world had been turned upside down. For the first time in years, the chancellor did not set the tone at an EU summit, nor did she and the French president agree on joint positions in a backroom before the meeting.\nMuch depends on whether Merkel and Hollande will be able to find common ground in the fight over Europe's common currency. They have been arguing for weeks over whether more austerity or more spending can save the euro. Now the dispute has reached a new level of escalation. After Hollande's statements on Wednesday, Merkel is now presenting her opposing concept. In a six-point plan, she calls for deep-seated structural reforms for Europe. Under the plan, government-owned businesses are to be sold off, protections against wrongful dismissal relaxed and obstructive regulations for companies removed. There is also talk of special economic zones and privatization agencies based on the model of Germany's Treuhand trust, created at the time of reunification to sell off most of former East Germany's state-owned enterprises. In short, the Mediterranean region is to become more like Germany, but with better weather.\nMerkel and Hollande are presenting two contrasting programs for the planned EU growth summit at the end of June. A compromise will have to be reached in the end, but there are still considerable risks. If the two leaders manage to forge a joint concept for the currency zone out of their different plans, they could go down in history as the saviors of the euro. If they fail, the process that a growing number of experts believe is unavoidable will only be accelerated: the breakup of the monetary union.\nThis week, Europe seemed to move a little closer to the abyss. The financial markets speculated on a Greek withdrawal from the euro, the exchange rate for the common currency plunged to new lows and economic imbalances worsened. While Germany was able to float a two-year bond with a zero interest rate on the markets for the first time, risk premiums for Spanish and Italian sovereign debt remained at crisis levels.\nThe euro zone is drifting apart, and the Franco-German dispute over how to tackle the problem is partly to blame. It isn't just a question of growth programs or the fiscal pact. Europe's political equilibrium, which has shifted since Hollande came into office, is also at stake.\nA president has stepped onto the stage who wants to"}
{"idx": "23898", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Purchase of virtual goods are starting to take off on the iPhone and game startups are starting to prosper from the added revenue, according to data from mobile analytics firm Flurry. For game developers, that means that the iPhone is finally living up to its potential as a revenue generator for third-party app creators.\nApple turned on the in-app purchase feature for the iPhone last fall. That enabled game developers to embrace the same \u201cfree to play\u201d business model that has made companies such as Zynga so successful on Facebook. In that model, companies offer their games for free, but they charge real money for virtual goods such as better weapons or online multiplayer play. The in-app purchase feature allows gamers to purchase their goods without leaving their games at all.\nThe results are surprisingly good. In January, Flurry said that the games that it tracked generated revenue of $9 per user per year, on average. In June, that number had risen to $14.66 per user per year. Previously, these games were generating around 99 cents to $1.99 per user per year. The data was measured across 21 iPhone game makers. The in-app purchase numbers are really high. They may reflect the fact that the people purchasing the iPhone now are early adopters and are likely to spend much more money than most users. Over time, the number might naturally go down; but for now, it is rising as the number of iPhones in the market increases.\nThe virtual goods revenue does not include revenue from ads, which is expected to increase as Apple activates its iAds advertising feature for the fourth version of the iPhone operating system, dubbed iOS. Users are now getting used to the new business model, which is like putting quarters into arcade machines.\nGiven all of this progress, the issues related to the iPhone 4 couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse time. If Apple is forced to recall the product, the platform could lose momentum, allowing others to catch up a little, and that will hurt the entire app community. But if Apple gets past this problem, the developers could breathe a sigh of relief.\nSimon Jeffery, chief publishing officer at Ngmoco (pictured, third from left), spoke on the mobile games panel at our MobileBeat 2010 conference this week. He confirmed that his company has prospered ever since it switched to free-to-play games. San Francisco-based Ngmoco does not disclose its revenues as a private company. But its fortunes looked so good that it managed to raise $25 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Norwest Venture Parters and Maples Investments in February.\nRandy Breen, chief executive of SGN (pictured, second from left), an iPhone game maker in Palo Alto, Calif., echoed Jeffery\u2019s comments, saying his company has made more money from free-to-play transactions for its F.A.S.T. flight simulator game than it did by selling the app outright.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running the game as a service and making more money that way,\u201d Breen said.\nBack when selling an iPhone app was the only option to make money, SGN\u2019s move away from Facebook to the iPhone was viewed as a bad strategy, at least compared to Zynga\u2019s decision to focus on Facebook games. But now, with 4 billion apps sold and an estimated 100 million iOS devices sold, and now with virtual goods models taking off on the iPhone, SGN\u2019s bet isn\u2019t looking so silly.\nApps that are sold for a flat fee of 99 cents to $4.99"}

Amid a suspicion of offside, Martyn Durrant bundled over Nick Edginton in the left-hand side of the box as Westfield looked at it and Bradley Miles sent Harry Stapley the wrong way with the resulting penalty.\nWestfield had a penalty shout for handball turned down during a bright start to the second half. Cornford then skipped past two defenders before lifting his shot over the outrushing Magee and was really unlucky to see it strike the underside of the crossbar.\nDurrant sent a 25-yard free kick narrowly wide before Ruston struck the crossbar with his left foot at the other end. Cornford's deflected shot at the end of a fine run was saved and Ellis then had a 25-yard drive fingertipped over.\nWestfield almost grabbed a comical equaliser in the third minute of added time.

Any that lend themselves to future propagation from cuttings or division are better still, and might clinch the purchase.\nSix young cyclamen plants, bought in full bloom last November, flowered until late March, at which point we withdrew water, allowing all top growth to fade. They remained in pots, laid on their side, in the greenhouse until May when the corms were cleaned off and placed high and dry on a shelf.\nTwo months ago, tiny shoots emerged, signalling time to fill pots with fresh, moist compost and push them gently into the surface. These stand on a drip tray of wet pebbles. Water comes from the base to avoid corm damage. They\u2019re offered plenty of daylight in temperatures of 10C to 15C and are flowering in the conservatory.\nNow their annual care cycle is established, the potential for longevity is good."}

Despite panicking at the Olympic trials and nearly turning back, McLaughlin ended up setting a world junior record at 54.14 seconds.\nShe sealed her place on the U.S. Olympic team earlier than she and her family anticipated.\nThe Olympics \u201chas always been on my mind but not at the age of 16,\u201d she said.\nHer father agreed that it was something they always talked about, but had not expected so quickly.\nNow, her parents are also figuring out plans to get to Rio, in order to see their daughter fulfill a dream they had always envisioned.\nThe fact that there are always more races to run and a \u201cchance to do it better\u201d motivates her to keep going.\nAfter the trials, McLaughlin attended the ESPY Awards and received an award for being named the Gatorade National High School Female Athlete of the Year. She gave a speech and talked about the obstacles she had faced throughout the previous year.\nA busload of people from Union Catholic High School was at the airport in New Jersey ready to welcome her back home.\nOn August 7, McLaughlin will turn 17.

Here's how you can keep track of your trip and share the journey with friends by making interactive maps.\nPlanning a holiday? Apart from working out an itinerary and places to stay, you may want to keep track of your journey along the way by making an interactive map.\nWhether you're an app fan or prefer a dedicated GPS device, there are many different tools available to suit all budgets. Share the journey with friends and family, or just keep the map as a memento of your trip.\nHere are just a few of the many ways you can make interactive maps to track your trip.\nOften the first port of call for those who already have a Google account, the search giant's map offering is fairly robust when it comes to creating custom maps if you want to input everything manually.\nTo get started on desktop, head to maps.google.com. In the top left corner, hover over the search bar and select \"Create\". This will open up the Maps Engine -- or you can bookmark that link and go straight there.\nFrom here, you can plot your route manually by using the search box to enter in location names. Then, drop the marker tool over starting points, or points of interest. Once the marker tool is in place, you have the option to enter a name and notes for the pin.\nAlong the route in selected locations where you drop pins, you can add photos and videos that appear alongside the pin. Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't support uploading images through the interface directly. Instead, you'll need to upload them in a separate location or from a photo-sharing service and paste the link. Otherwise, you can do a Google image or YouTube search to add relevant photos and videos.\nFrom here, create a driving, biking, or walking route to trace your trip using the drawing tool. The mapping tool also offers some extra control by giving distance measurements, layer settings and directions. Sharing is as simple as selecting the \"Share\" option from the top right of the screen.\nIf this all sounds like too much, don't worry. Plenty of the following tools and apps feature tight integration with Google Maps so all the hard work is done for you.\nDesigned for the keen roadtripper, Hema Explorer is a fully-fledged navigation and mapping app for Australian roads that runs on iOS and Android. It supports online and offline GPS navigation and is one of the most comprehensive apps available to keep track of your trip.\nThe app comes with a variety of different maps including street, terrain, and satellite. A weather radar overlay adds another level of granularity -- plus there are over 40,000 points of interest included to give you information about sights and locations.\nHema Explorer also supports adding custom waypoints to keep a track of your specific journey. Using your device's built-in camera, you can add geotagged photos to a particular waypoint.\nThe app also supports syncing trips via the Hema Explorer Cloud. This transfers waypoints, photos with geotagged information, and track recordings to your online account which can then be shared via Facebook, Twitter or a custom link.\nFor those who want to get serious about mapping and prefer to carry a dedicated GPS device, the Magellan eXplorist range may be for you. Powered by two AA batteries, the unit acts as a navigation device and comes equipped with a 3.2-megapixel camera, microphone and touchscreen to record your trip.\nOnce the device calibrates your position, it can act as a navigator or a tool to track your progress.

It's done by creating a digital wallet that serves as a repository for all kinds of personal and financial data, info that can only be shared after a specific request and only with the permission of the owner.\nBlockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u2013 in combination with digital identity verification \u2013 holds the potential to solve online privacy issues that plague everything from consumer sales and bank know-your-customer regulations to employee credentials that allow access to confidential business systems.\n\"There are multiple vendors in this space that are either in the early R&D stage or testing their products in pilot projects,\" said Homan Farahmand, a senior research director with Gartner. \"It is too early to declare any winner, by any means, because just having a working product is not enough. Decentralized identity requires a vibrant ecosystem, a robust identity trust fabric built on a distributed ledger or blockchain, tools to support user-friendly functionality and good developer experience to support broad adoption.\"\nOne considerable security attribute of storing digital identities on an encrypted, distributed blockchain ledger is eliminating \"honey pots,\" or central repositories for customer account information, according to Julie Esser, chief engagement officer for CULedger, a Denver-based Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO). Those repositories are prime targets for hackers.\nLike other CUSOs, CULedger is a cooperative owned by multiple credit unions for the purpose of providing back-office services; it was created a year ago to build out a blockchain-based identity management platform called My CUID. The platform is expected to launch in the second half of 2019 and will hand the keys to data protection over to customers who sign up for an app. CULedger has 36 investors \u2013 26 credit unions and several CUSOs.\nIn October, CULedger began piloting My CUID with five other credit unions and another CUSO; it eliminated the need for user names and passwords and relieved credit union call centers from the obligation of resetting them when a customer loses them.\nHow it works: a new or current customer of a member credit union contacts a customer service call center, which sends a text message to the customer's mobile device with a link to download the My CUID app. The credit union's rep then issues the customer their credentials \u2013 a digital wallet, which holds personally identifiable information obtained during the initial customer contact. That information is encrypted and can only be accessed with the member's authorization, which is requested when they make a transaction.\nEach time a customer using My CUID contacts the credit union \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 their smartphone or tablet receives a pop-up dialogue requesting they confirm their membership before any transaction is completed.\n\"You'd click OK or Not OK. It doesn't feel a lot different than what happens with other apps on your phone,\" Esser said. \"It's all based on...the encrypted channels we've created, which is really cool. You're creating a two-way secure communication channel. So, not only does your credit union know it's you they"}

Epileptics who live in areas with higher crime rates, including the South Side and the Loop, had more seizures than those living in areas with less crime, according to a UIC study.\nChicago residents with epilepsy who live in areas with higher crime rates, including the South Side and the Loop, had up to three times as many seizures in a month as those living in areas of the city with less crime, according to a University of Illinois at Chicago study presented Sunday at an annual American Epilepsy Society conference.\nIn the study, 63 Chicago residents with epilepsy, who are part of a larger study and receive treatment at UIC\u2019s epilepsy clinic, recorded the number of seizures they experienced in one- and three-month periods. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that causes seizures that can often, but not always, be controlled by medication, according to researchers.\nDr. Dilip Pandey, UIC associate professor of neurology and rehabilitation and lead investigator on the study, said researchers found that those who lived in neighborhoods with higher crime rates reported, on average, three seizures during a one-month period, and seven seizures during a three-month period. That compared with one and four seizures, respectively, reported by the residents in areas with lower crime rates, he said.\nThe researchers used ZIP codes and crime rate data from the Chicago Police Department to arrive at their conclusions, Pandey said. They determined a median crime rate among the ZIP codes where the study participants lived.\nThough Pandey wouldn\u2019t specify the exact ZIP codes where study participants lived, due to confidentiality reasons, he said residents who reported the most seizures lived on the South Side, followed by the Loop, West Side and Far Southwest Side. Residents in ZIP codes with low crime rates \u2014 who reported fewer seizures \u2014 lived on the Southwest Side, Far Southeast Side, as well as on the North and Northwest sides, he said.\nResearchers already know that the stress hormone cortisol can trigger a seizure in epileptics, as well as anxiety and depression, he said. But until there\u2019s a larger study, researchers can\u2019t be sure that there\u2019s a clear link between crime rate and seizures, or that it\u2019s due to stress. The results do show that a larger study is warranted, he said, and it\u2019s an important topic of study because physicians could take into account where someone lives when developing a treatment plan.\nMorgan Murphy, director of communications at the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago, said these results are not surprising, and it\u2019s an area that needs more study.\nA link between seizure frequency and crime rates for those with epilepsy could also be due to access to medication, she said. Regular medication, which can be expensive for the uninsured, is important for keeping seizures at bay, Murphy said. Still, 30 percent of those who take medication regularly still cannot keep seizures under control, so it\u2019s not the only factor, she said."}

Of those using willpower alone, 15.4 percent had managed to stop.\nE-cigarettes contain nicotine - a stimulant not thought to be particularly harmful, although it is addictive - delivering it in a water vapour rather than in smoke from burning tobacco.\nA relatively new product, they have become highly controversial, with public health opinion split over whether they might be a powerful tool in helping those hooked on cigarettes to finally give up, or whether they simply replace one bad habit with another.\nBecause switching to e-cigarettes from tobacco ones does not entail kicking the addiction to nicotine, some specialists say they could spell the end of smoking - which the World Health Organisation (WHO) calls \"one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced\".\nBut critics point to a lack of long-term scientific evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes, and warn they may also re-normalise smoking, enticing children or other non-smokers to take it up.\nWest agreed that evidence about long-term use is e-cigarettes is scant, but stressed the balance of risks had to be weighed against the very strong evidence of tobacco's harms.\n\"It's not clear whether long-term use of e-cigarettes carries health risks, but from what is known about the contents of the vapour these will be much less than from smoking,\" he said.\nSmoking tobacco kills half of all those who do it, according to the WHO, and has a death toll of 6 million people a year.\nWest said evidence shows that smokers who seek professional help from doctors or health clinics that provide stop-smoking services have the highest success rates in quitting.\n\"These almost triple a smoker's odds of successfully quitting compared with going it alone or relying on over-the-counter products,\" he said."}

I loved going there. She would give me boxes of fabric. My dolls had the most elegant wardrobes.\"\nMcFerren also will display two other traditional quilts that contain intense jewel tone colors which were created during a block of the month program.

The striking three-dimensional pieces measure a total of 14 feet and are titled \"Falling Leaves.\"\nMoller, who began quilting in 2007, said she loves trees and draws inspiration from nature and her surroundings.

As a result, ground based observers will see no changes in theappearance of the comet and besides, the spacecraft itself is far too small tobe seen using ground based telescopes.\nComet Hartley 2 was notNASA's first choice for Deep Impact's second comet rendezvous.\nMission scientistsoriginally planned for a December 2008 flyby of Comet Boethin and on July 21,2005 the Deep Impact probe fired its thrusters in a maneuver that allowed it touse Earth's gravity to begin a new mission in a path toward Comet Boethin.\nBut soon scientists wasrealized that there was a problem.\nAstronomers could not findComet Boethin in surveys and suspect that it apparently fragmented into myriad tinyparticles. This meant rewriting a new game plan for Deep Impact.\nA new target was selected:Comet 103P/Hartley 2.\nTo reach this new comet,however, would require an extra two years of travel for the spacecraft.

It would have been bigger had Iowa beaten Northwestern last week, but they didn\u2019t. By losing that game, the Hawkeyes took themselves out of the Big 10 race. Ohio State however is still very much alive and is in a three-way tie with Michigan State and Wisconsin for the conference lead.\nEven though the Rose Bowl is out of reach, I expect the Hawkeyes to be extremely motivated, not just because a big time bowl game is still possible, but because the Buckeyes were the ones who cost them a chance at the Big 10 title last year. Iowa has the priceless opportunity to return the favor this time around.\nNeedless to say, this will be a defensive oriented game where field position will be at a premium. Both teams rank towards the top in nearly every defensive categories. Ohio State allows 14 points per game with Iowa nearly as good, letting up just 15 per contest.\nThe Buckeyes have several offensive weapons whether we\u2019re talking about wide receivers Dane Sanzenbacher and DeVier Posey or running back Dan Herron \u2013 But the main weapon is obviously quarterback Terrelle Pryor who\u2019s capable of dominating a game both on the ground and through the air. The key for Iowa is to be physical and clamp down on Sanzenbacher and Posey. The Hawkeye secondary has been shaky at times this season and will be tested here.\nA big advantage for Iowa lies up front where I think they\u2019ll win the battle of the lines \u2013 especially defensively. Adrian Clayborn anchors a Hawkeye D-line that never gives an inch. They\u2019ll have to get pressure on Pryor and rely on the linebackers to take away the outside running lanes. If they do this it will limit the time Sanzenbacher and Posey have to roam free in the secondary. This is a big spot for the Buckeyes offensive line, and I think they\u2019re in for trouble against Clayborn and company.\nI expect Iowa to win the battle on the other side of the ball as well. Ohio State has a very strong defense, but this has all the makings of a Ricky Stanzi classic. The Iowa quarterback has had a great season and has really grown as a quarterback and leader. He struggled last week against Northwestern. That loss has been eating at him for a week and I think he\u2019ll take his frustrations out on the Buckeyes come Saturday.\nIowa has one of the best offensive lines in the nation. They\u2019ll give Stanzi time in the pocket to get the ball to his weapons Marvin McNutt and Derrell Johnson-Koulianos. I also expect to see a steady mix on the ground with running back Adam Robinson who can pound it up the middle and also explode quickly to the corner. The key will be to not turn the ball over and ball security is an area where Iowa thrives.\n#7 Wisconsin @ Michigan: The Badgers are in great shape in the Big 10 race. They travel to the Big House, a place where they haven\u2019t won in 16 years. They\u2019ll be taking on talented, yet flawed Wolverine team looking to make a statement of their own.\nWisconsin is red-hot, having won 5 games in a row and putting up 83 points in their victory over Indiana last week. It\u2019s safe to say this is a team on a mission. They will most likely be without star running back John Clay who is still suffering from a sprained knee.

{"idx": "23953", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Previews of Amy Chua's forthcoming book, \"The Triple Package\" (co-written with husband Jed Rubenfeld), detonated a social media uproar among Asian-Americans.\nMany were infuriated by the New York Post's report that Chua, the self-styled Tiger Mom, was identifying eight superior \"cultural\" groups in the United States: Jewish, Indian, Chinese, Iranian, Lebanese, Nigerian, Cuban and Mormon.\nFor Asian-Americans, the problem is about another Chua production that seems to perpetuate the \"model minority\" myth and, in particular, the notion that Asians are culturally - even genetically - endowed with the characteristics that enable them to succeed in American society.\nBefore the mid-20th century, the Tiger Mom did not exist in the national imagination. Instead, Americans believed that Chinese culture was disgusting and vile, viewing U.S. Chinatowns as depraved colonies of prostitutes, gamblers and opium addicts bereft of decency. Lawmakers and citizens deployed these arguments to justify and maintain the segregation, marginalization and exclusion of Chinese from mainline society between the 1870s and World War II. Those efforts were more than effective: to have a \"Chinaman's chance\" at that time meant that one had zero prospects.\nThere is danger in offering culture as a formula for success, because our ideas of culture are hardly fixed. The history of Americans' views about Chinese immigrant behaviors shows that \"culture\" often serves as a blank screen onto which individuals project various political agendas.\nDuring World War II, white liberals agonized that racism was damaging the United States' ability to fight a war for democracy against the Axis powers. Many felt that the Chinese exclusion laws, which had barred migrants from China from entering the country or becoming naturalized citizens, risked America's trans-Pacific alliance with China against Japan. A coast-to-coast campaign emerged to overturn the laws.\nThe Citizens Committee to Repeal Chinese Exclusion recognized that it would have to neutralize deep-seated fear of \"yellow peril\" coolie hordes. So it strategically recast Chinese in its promotional materials as \"law-abiding, peace-loving, courteous people living quietly among us.\" Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943.\nIn the 1950s, journalists, social scientists and policymakers recycled this fledgling idea, circulating it further and wider as they groped for a solution to what they perceived as a national juvenile delinquency crisis. U.S. Rep. Arthur Klein of New York praised his Manhattan Chinatown constituents for their \"respect for parents and teachers,\" \"stable and loving home life\" and thirst for education.\nThese narratives gained traction because they upheld two dominant lines of Cold War-era thinking. The first was the valorization of the nuclear family. Popular portrayals of Chinese-American households that attributed their orderliness to Confucian tradition resonated with conservative mores.\nBy the 1960s, the concept of strong, disciplined families became the basis of the new racial stereotype of Chinese-Americans as \"model minorities\": domestic exemplars, upwardly mobile and politically docile. In the midst of the black freedom movement, numerous politicians and academics and the mainstream media contrasted Chinese with African-Americans. They found it expedient to invoke Chinese \"culture\" to counter the demands of civil rights and black power"}

The North also has demanded that the US end harsh economic penalties and provide security guarantees before it takes any steps beyond its initial suspension of nuclear and missile tests.\nHarry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the Center for National Interest, said any talks between the two nations are a positive development, but the hard work of negotiating an agreement has only begun.\n\u201cBoth nations must now show at least some tangible benefits from their diplomatic efforts during a second summit, or risk their efforts being panned as nothing more than reality TV,\u201d Kazianis said.\nAs a possible first step, Kazianis said, North Korea could agree to close its nuclear centrifuge facility at Yongbyon in exchange for some relief from US sanctions or a peace declaration ending the Korean War.

Since its inception, the task force has focused its attention on wage negotiation trainings, understanding that women are less likely to negotiate wages and benefits than their male counterparts, because they are concerned about backlash when they do. The task force spearheaded wage negotiation trainings across the state and on college campuses, hosted two successful equal pay summits and will host a third next month focused on women in business and policies and practices that impact fair pay.\nAs co-chairs of the task force, we have worked closely with Gov. Bullock on fair pay and equality initiatives. The Department of Administration took direct action to prevent discrimination in state contracts by amending contract language to protect state and contract employees against discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. The state has conducted its own pay audit and served as a resource for city governments as they start their own pay equity initiatives.\nAs members of Bullock\u2019s cabinet, we are fortunate.

Obama declared that he has no strategy and he would only try to \"contain\" the IS.The Obama administration is scared and left without real options.Therefore it has allowed Iran to dominate the scene both in Iraq and Syria. Is this how to deal with the enemy ?.\nThey're spinning the story, what's happened is the Iranians have instructed Baghdad to get rid of the Americans, all of it, the air support, bases, training etc. and now the Americans are doing damage control, trying to save face. Fist they claimed Baghdad is not requesting more air support, now they're claiming that they want to \"avoid civilian casualties\", they have no such concerns in Syria or Yemen or Afghanistan. A month ago the Pentagon and the administration declared that they were planing to send additional advisers, special forces and around 4000 marines to Iraq, this past week they've changed their tone completely, even today Dempsey said Iraq \"doesn't need\" more US trainers or advisories.\nThe U.S. is committed to provide about 4500 trainers and advisors for 9 Iraqi brigades, and 3 Peshmerga brigades. There have been no reports that Obama has reneged on this commitment. Gen. Dempsey may be saying Iraq needs no more U.S. trainers beyond these numbers who may be already in Iraq and Kurdistan ( We know they are there on the Al Assad Base in Anbar for example since they were threatened by ISIS controlling Baghdad, the city next door ). All indications are there is close coordinating between the U.S. Al-Abadi and the Kurds, may be even the Iranians.

It states that while \"the term 'Mormon Church' has long been publicly applied to the Church as a nickname, it is not an authorized title, and the Church discourages its use.\" It also asks that the term \"Mormons\" not be used in references to members.\nAlso out: the word \"Mormonism,\" which the style guide states is an \"inaccurate\" word to use to describe the \"doctrine, culture and lifestyle unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" But the word Mormon is fine to use in proper names, like the Book of Mormon, or in historical expressions like the Mormon Trail.\nThe style guide was published on a church website, along with comments from the church's leader.\n\"The Lord has impressed upon my mind the importance of the name He has revealed for His Church, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" Russell M. Nelson, the church's president, said in a statement. \"We have work before us to bring ourselves in harmony with His will. In recent weeks, various Church leaders and departments have initiated the necessary steps to do so.\"\nOver the next few months, church websites and other materials will be updated to fall in line with this new directive, the statement said.\nAnd that leads to all kinds of questions: Will the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir be renamed?

Will the letters \"LDS\" disappear from the plethora of related entities that carry it, such as the LDS Business College, LDS Charities or Intermountain LDS Hospital?\nEven the website that announced the preferences for the name is called mormonnewsroom.org.

After all, these systems were subsets of airlines.\nThen they started interconnecting and do bookings for Third Parties and ticketing commission was viewed as potential compensation for the costs of running these systems. To avoid claims of conflict-of-interest the systems were hived off from the carriers but still based on 'gentleman's agreements'.\nIn fact, the airlines/carriers relied upon these former carrier entities to do their ticket accounting!\nThe GDS/CRS systems used to deduct their 'cut', aka commission, from the money they paid to the airlines. From this 'cut' they would pay commissions to user travel agents.\nWhen the airline business was stressed, the airlines started to use software to ensure that the GDS/CRS commissions were credited when tickets and - surprise, surprise - the airlines discovered they were being bilked for hundreds of millions of US Dollars (the currency upon which the back-end of the travel industry is based).\nThe carriers, after wrestling multi-million refunds from the GDS/CRS, then implemented stricter ticket accounting systems.\nMeanwhile down at the Travel Agent level, many discovered they could earn 'points', 'credits', 'awards' by ticketing through GDS/GRS.

No one thinks, not those ordering them and not those opposing them, that the missile strikes against the Assad regime will influence the outcome of the catastrophe in Syria. That pass was sold long since. If there was an opportunity for America, Britain and their allies to make a difference for the better, the chance was missed many, many deaths ago. What we are witness to \u2013 on the part of both the leaders of the western democracies and their critics \u2013 is a tableau of actors striking postures designed to make the players feel better about themselves. This posing can never rewrite the blood-drenched history of a seven-year conflict that has turned Syria into a charnel house and shredded international norms about the conduct of war.\nThe proximate cause of this crisis is the chemical attack on Douma last weekend. After years of unmasterly inactivity by the democracies, it is that atrocity that drew attention back to what is happening in Syria and finally stirred punitive action against Bashar al-Assad. In the words of the ineffable Donald Trump, the retaliatory strikes are supposed to demonstrate to \u201canimal Assad\u201d that there is a \u201cprice to pay\u201d for the dictator\u2019s use of banned weaponry. In the more measured language of Theresa May, \u201cwe cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to be normalised\u201d. Yet the normalisation of chemical weapons is precisely what has already happened in Syria. Assad\u2019s regime has time and again used chemical warfare to slaughter its own people, as it has also deployed hideous \u201cconventional\u201d weapons such as dropping barrel bombs and fuel-air bombs on civilian areas to inflict mass casualties.\nOver seven years of relentless savagery in Syria, the hands of the leaders of the western powers have been wedged firmly under their bottoms. They have been encouraged to maintain this impotent posture by legislators too feeble to grip the dilemmas posed by Syria and voters weary of engagement with the hard parts of the world. Listening to both their public pronouncements and their private calculations, the abiding impression is that this belated and limited action by Washington, London and Paris is not driven by any conviction that these strikes will make any meaningful difference. They won\u2019t even stop Assad manufacturing more chemical weapons if he chooses to do so. Missiles are flying mainly to soothe guilt about repeated earlier failures to act.\nEven so, I give these leaders a little more credit than I can find for those whose only counsel is to do absolutely nothing. At least some of these belated interventionists are wrestling with a genuine dilemma. Action over this chemical attack, when so many previous atrocities have been given a free pass, looks like therapy by Tomahawk, a gesture, not a strategy. But to let yet another use of chemical weapons happen without any form of response would have given a complete sense of impunity to the Assad regime and its sponsors in the Kremlin. Every dictatorship on the planet has been getting the message that there is no penalty for the acquisition and use of weapons prohibited since the First World War and that has chilling implications for future conflicts.\nThe other side of our tableau of posturers is composed of those who oppose this action as they have clamoured against all previous attempts to do something about Syria. The non-interventionists come in two categories. There are the \u201cit\u2019s nothing to do with us\u201d brigade who declare that \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a dog in the Syrian fight\u201d.

Space in the downtown headquarters, which is shared with the Weld Library District and the Union Colony Fire/Rescue Authority, is so tight that police converted break rooms into office space. About a dozen supervisors share a room built for two.\nUnfortunately, city council members forgot to let the public in on the discussion. Instead, council members have met for months in closed sessions, debating where new police headquarters should be and how to pay for the construction. They even took the illegal action of deciding, in closed session, on a site. According to the Colorado open meetings law, all official action must be taken in public session.\nOnly after the Tribune pressed the council did members admit they already have selected the old Kmart building on West 10th Street as the best site for the new headquarters. Now they\u2019re ready to ask for the voters\u2019 opinion.\nBut why should the voters be ready to spend an estimated $24 million when they haven\u2019t even been given a chance to offer their two cents? This question should concern the city council because voters will have to approve a sales tax or property tax increase to pay for the new headquarters.\nThe law allows council members to meet in closed session to discuss the purchase of real estate. The reason for this exception makes sense: Property owners might increase the price of their land if they know a government entity is interested.\nBut council members went well beyond the scope of this exception in their discussion of public policy, including whether the police station should be downtown or out west. The public must be a part of such matters.\nDespite all of the secrecy, council members aren\u2019t even united on their opinions about the location. Four like the old Kmart site in the 2800 block of 10th Street. Three want the headquarters to stay downtown, where the city\u2019s crime rate is the highest.\nThe city also has spent millions of dollars trying to revitalize downtown, so moving out hundreds of workers should be a significant concern. City leaders screamed loudly when Weld County government moved most of its workers out of downtown more than a decade ago.\nThe four council members, led by Mayor Tom Selders, make a good case for finally doing something about the empty Kmart building. It\u2019s an eyesore with plenty of land for the police.\nBut most Greeley residents don\u2019t know what to think because they haven\u2019t been privy to the conversation. Council members pledge to get people involved between now and a November election.\nHowever, that\u2019s not enough time to rebuild the trust they\u2019ve lost through their illegal actions. Even without this misstep, voters are reluctant to pass any tax increase. Now they have one more reason to vote no.\nThe city needs a new police headquarters. Kmart might be the best site. Downtown might be even better.\nThe best ideas will come from the public. Even if council members apparently don\u2019t believe that, they soon will learn that nothing happens without public support."}

The season marks the final go-round of the landmark four-time Emmy-winning Best Drama Series. The protracted goodbye will be split between seven episodes this spring and the final final episodes in spring 2015.\nIt was all very bittersweet last night as production actually was just beginning on those even as the premiere was kicking off. In fact, executive producer Scott Hornbacher, who directed the \u201cTime Zones\u201d episode, was late to this party as he is also directing the first of those backend episodes.\nHe told me later at the Chateau Marmont afterparty that it\u2019s going to be tough to end it, pointing to several people in the room he described as \u201cfamily,\u201d people he saw every day.

He warned everyone not to give away too many plot points of the episode, which opens in 1969 as Don Draper travels to Southern California to rejoin wife Megan. \u201cAs you know you are seeing this two weeks prior to what will be airing on AMC so we ask that all of you treat tonight\u2019s premiere as Don Draper treats his private life \u2014 which is to say that even if your daughter walks into your room tonight and wants an explanation you just say \u2018It\u2019s not what you think\u2019,\u201d he laughed.

If that happens, there is no certain outcome.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., must contend with the ambitions of several GOP presidential candidates. One of them, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, has made it his business to oppose the Kentuckian at every turn, even taking to the Senate floor to accuse him of lying.\nNow Cruz is once again goading a group of House tea partyers who have wreaked havoc with the leadership in the past.\nTogether they are demanding that must-pass spending legislation cut off all federal money for Planned Parenthood. The efforts follows the disclosure of secretly recorded videos in which Planned Parenthood officials are shown discussing how they acquire fetal parts for medical research.\nSuch a bill could not pass the Senate and would face a certain veto from President Barack Obama, raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown like the one two years ago in a similar struggle over the health care law.\n\"There's nothing principled about the idea of another government shutdown,\" the president said in his weekend radio address.\"\nWith less than two weeks to the Oct. 1 deadline, there remains no endgame \u2014 unless it's divine intervention in the form of a historic address from Pope Francis to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday.\nAnd for the majority of congressional Republicans, who have little interest in palace intrigue or shutdown talk, the infighting and disarray serves only as a depressing reminder of the GOP's repeated failures to capitalize on historic congressional majorities to advance a governing agenda that could help their party retake the presidency. Nor does it bode well for how Republicans navigate fights yet to come this year, including a potentially market-rattling struggle over raising the government's borrowing limit.\n\"There are some in the House who are using serious governance issues to score cheap political points against the speaker,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. \"Shutting down the government is not in our political interest, it will undermine the Republican brand and it will hurt whoever the Republican nominee is in November.\"\nSuch warnings are dismissed by the most unyielding conservatives in the House, who insist that the only way to force Obama to reckon with their demands to defund Planned Parenthood is by including it in must-pass spending legislation to keep the government open. The tactic has failed twice before \u2014 two years ago over the health care law and earlier this year in an unsuccessful revolt against Obama's executive actions limiting deportations.\nNonetheless, some Republicans continue to insist that their leaders must hold firm, despite the prospect of an Obama veto and even though McConnell has repeatedly made clear that legislation to defund Planned Parenthood cannot pass the Senate's 60-vote threshold, which demands compromise with minority Democrats. They reject such logic as capitulation.\n\"There will be a significant number of Republicans who will say, 'I will vote no on any bill that has an opportunity to defund Planned Parenthood and fails to do so,' \" said Rep.

It cannot buy fuel for its emergency vehicles, and wants financial support from the city.\n\"The city has an obligation to fund us,\" Springdale Fire Chief Shawn Fahan says.\nBut the city doesn't see it that way -- it already gave the department nearly enough to cover its debt over the past two months.\n\"The fact that the city sent you over $22,000 is indisputable,\" says William Callion, director of public safety.\nThat might be. But what is really indisputable is that fighting among the various factions of Stamford's fire service is going to continue until a much bigger problem is solved. And that is how Stamford should best provide fire protection to its citizens.\nWhat the city has now is a hodgepodge of one career department downtown and five independent departments, each responsible for its own part of the city and staffed with a mixture of volunteer and professional firefighters. The independents rely on the city for funding, however, which causes problems like the one above, especially since Mayor Dannel Malloy cut the budget of some of them as part of an attempt to modernize the overall service.\nIn short, it's a mess that might have made sense when it was created in the 1940s, but now wastes time, tempers and taxpayers' money. Problems go back more than a decade and have led to lawsuits, charges of bad faith and, quite possibly, breakdowns in fire protection.\nSo much bad blood has built up that the fire service in its current form is simply incapable of righting itself. There will be more fighting, and more lawsuits, for as long as the system continues as is.\nStamford needs one -- one -- fire department that serves the entire city and operates under one chain of command.\nThe mayor has been right to attempt to consolidate the department, but has gone about it in a way that has caused too much resentment, such as when he tried to put city firefighters into three volunteer houses two years ago, and then cut the funding of the two that resisted. It's significant that a state Superior Court judge last month ordered the city to repay the funds to one of the departments.\nThis is a change that should be made on the city Charter level. Let the people decide what type of fire service they are paying for. And, by the way, there's no reason a single, professional department that serves the entire city cannot have a robust volunteer operation. Volunteer firefighters are a cherished part of this city. But the current model, as is, is simply way out of date.\nThis is one issue in Stamford on which we wait to hear from our two mayoral candidates. How do they think the fire service should be structured? Should it be done by Charter change? If not, how? And even if they do pursue the Charter option, that will take a long time. How do they propose smoothing out the many problems within the service until then?\nThis issue will be a good test of the mayoral candidates' mettle during the upcoming campaign. It's a major problem, but it's also a political minefield, given how deeply the roots of the different departments course through this city. How each candidate navigates it could tell voters a lot about the man."}

Biden Jr., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, foreign policy adviser Rand Beers and aide Nancy Stetson, Agence France-Presse said.\nActor-director Vincent Gallo is a pariah in the show business community for his outspoken conservative views. In an interview with reporter Steve Miller of The Washington Times yesterday, Mr. Gallo noted one of the great Tinseltown ironies.\nOf course, we\u2019re happy to name names.\nAccording to news reports, said \u201cclowns\u201d in hybrid vehicles included Save-the-World couple Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, singer Sting and actor Robin Williams.\nMr. Gallo, who happily unleashes a stream of invective about Hollywood and its leftist inclinations, also noted the prevalence of photos of President Bill Clinton in the homes of the rich and famous.\nDemocratic Sen. John Kerry would defeat President Bush in Florida if the presidential election were held now, according to poll results released yesterday.\nThe telephone survey of 800 registered Florida voters showed that 49 percent would vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Mr. Kerry, 43 percent for Republican incumbent Mr. Bush and 3 percent for independent candidate Ralph Nader. With eight months to go before the election, 5 percent were undecided, Reuters news agency reports.\nThe poll suggests that another photo finish could loom in the politically divided state that Mr. Bush won by 537 votes in 2000.\nThe poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday, right after the Massachusetts senator effectively clinched the Democratic nomination by winning contests in nine of 10 states on Super Tuesday. The survey had a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, speeches by the Massachusetts senator have been broadcast on Radio Pyongyang and reported in glowing terms by the Korea Central News Agency (KCNA), the official mouthpiece of Mr Kim\u2019s communist regime. \u2026\u201d the Financial Times said.\nSen. John Kerry, who says it\u2019s \u201cneat\u201d that fellow Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is campaigning for him, anticipates that the Republicans will try to use it as a liability, and is trying to distance himself somewhat politically from Mr. Kennedy, Newsweek reports.\nMr. Kerry, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, disputes the idea that \u201cKennedy\u201d is a dirty word and adds that any attempt to link him to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s record \u201cis not going to work, it\u2019s so silly and infantile. I\u2019ve been a deficit hawk since the day I arrived, so let them try,\u201d he told reporter Melinda Henneberger.\nNow that Mr. Kerry has sewn up the nomination, though, Republicans with long experience in running against Kennedys real and imagined are reveling in the connection. Footage from their primary-season road show is sure to figure prominently in Bush ads, Newsweek said.\nBecky Whetstone has something to say to people who think they know why she\u2019s running for Congress:"}

No less than 450 people attended the pool at different times throughout the day. The weather was hot and the water was circulating at more than 30 degrees celsius. A BIG thank you to Walcha Council for their sponsorship and support, librarian Maddison Garrad for organising the event, Councillor Rachael Wellings for help conducting the competitions, Rob Powell for setting up the movie, and to my assistant attendants Kelly Makeham, Adele Laurie and Harriet Monie for their efforts on the pool deck and in the kiosk. AT the end of the evening, Adele must have been a bit weary, because when she exited the pool gate, she turned in a northerly direction towards her car. The only problem was she had parked her car near the squash courts and left her car keys on the desk in the pool kiosk. There was a suggestion a good night\u2019s sleep may help.

DURING school holidays, Barb would travel from Guyra to Sydney to visit relatives, and while she was there on one trip, was booked into swimming lessons at the Watsons Bay Ocean Baths.

{"idx": "23998", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If men and women have equal opportunity in business, why are so few women at the top? The New York Times takes a look.\nThis weekend, the New York Times ran a long piece on women in business, with the cutesy title \"How Suite It Isn't: A Dearth of Female Bosses.\" The suite in question is the chief executive's office, and the findings on which the piece is based come from a Catalyst analysis we reported on back in July, which found that fewer than 2 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are female, and only 16.4 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500 companies are women. (For the true conspiracy theorists among you, we'd like to note that the percentage of women in Congress reached an all-time high of 16.448 this year.) The piece also echoes the Catalyst conclusion that companies exclude women to their own potential detriment, as female corporate officers and board members tend to have good returns as well as innovative environments and more diverse staff.\nEven though the piece is retracing familiar ground, it's interesting to read about the businesswomen it profiles, who share their successes as well as their obstacles, from having to fly cross-country when nine months pregnant to seal a business deal, to opting not to take the recommended time off after a mastectomy for fear of seeming frail, to hearing that \"women don't do those jobs.\" One subject, former Autodesk CEO and current board chairwoman Carol Bartz, laments on the one hand that \"there is a whole lot of hand-wringing going on with women ... they get the high-power degrees and then they drop back because they tell themselves they're not going to get very far anyway. I think they look around and wonder whether the struggle is worth it or not\" but acknowledges on the other hand that it's a lot easier to decide the struggle is worth it if you can pay for good childcare. \"The problem with balance is that it only works if you can buy some balance,\" she admits. Bartz also expresses a lack of interest in mentoring programs for other professional women, but acknowledges that her own career benefited greatly from networking.\nIn that vein, the Times notes that women who achieve success in the corporate world may be reluctant to help other women into similarly powerful positions: \"There is little consensus among [women in the business world] over how to approach the topic of women in power, or, in fact, whether the issue should even be addressed. Representatives of nearly all of the Fortune 500 female chief executives contacted for this article said that their bosses were either 'too busy' or did not want to participate in an article about female C.E.O.s. They said that these executives preferred to be acknowledged for their accomplishments, rather than for being women.\" This observation seems to speak to a complicated dynamic; women who have achieved against the odds might be reluctant to see the path made easier for others, and given current gender disparity among corporate officers, there may be little workplace benefit to being seen as a woman pioneering on behalf of other women rather than one of the boys.\nEspecially since the Times is pretty frank about the reasons for the dearth of women at the top, citing the fact that \"a number of women leave their careers -- sometimes by choice, sometimes not -- to focus on rearing families. The remaining pool suffers from a lack of networking or mentoring programs ... [and] many other women end up in dead-end staff positions.\" As for the limited options and lack of flexibility that women often face, there's the bald admission that \"analyst"}
