For three generations this family from the remote town of Thanedar near Shimla has been managing apple orchards, and riding Royal Enfield motorcycles. Even though Kumar now rides the Thunderbird, he and the whole town calls it the Bullet. Such strong is the brand name of the world\u2019s longest running production motorcycle model.\nBut when Kumar looks at the Royal Enfield I am riding, he changes his mind. \u201cIt just cannot be a Bullet,\u201d he says. Observing closely, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s the Himalayan.\u201d The Himalayan is a motorcycle purpose-built for adventure and touring. The company says that it brings together 60 years of Himalayan riding experiences in a fully ground-up design. Powered by the new 411cc, single-cylinder air-cooled engine, which produces a maximum output of 24.5bhp and a maximum torque of 32Nm, the Himalayan is built on a rugged duplex split cradle frame designed and developed by Harris Performance\u2014the UK-based motorcycle racing and parts manufacturer that Royal Enfield acquired last year.\nThe Himalayan doesn\u2019t look vastly different from most touring motorcycles; it\u2019s just that it is slightly smaller. And smaller means compared to, say, the Triumph Tiger range. But then, for Rs 1.55 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai), it is considerably cheaper too.\nThe front end, like most touring bikes, is tall. The front suspension is telescopic, with 41mm forks and 200mm travel. The monoshock rear suspension with linkage allows for 180mm wheel travel. We rode it on various kinds of roads\u2014freshly laid tarmac, no tarmac, waterlogged roads, and snow. The Himalayan, surprisingly, regardless of the terrain, delivered a smooth, untiring ride experience. Its 220mm ground clearance ensures it can, with some careful manoeuvring, even cross shallow river beds. The ground clearance, combined with an optimal wheel size\u2014the front tyre is 21-inch and the rear is 17-inch\u2014allows for good control while riding over a rocky terrain. The wheelbase of 1465mm means the bike handles twisty roads very well. Mention must be made of the Ceat dual-purpose tyres that the Himalayan rides on; they provide ample grip on almost all kinds of terrain. While we are yet to ride it on the highway, we have reasons to believe that the highway ride experience won\u2019t be tiring either. The seat height is 800mm, so even short riders won\u2019t feel intimidated sitting on the bike; however, the rear end is high, so taking your leg all the way to the other end, for short riders I mean, can be slightly difficult.\nWhat also leads to a comfortable ride experience is the ergonomic sync between footpegs, handlebar and seat height\u2014all of which provide"}

The Texas Military Department oversees the state's Army and Air National Guard.\nChief Warrant Officer 5 Glen Webb, the senior warrant officer for the Texas Army National Guard, said an investigation into the incident had been launched, but Thursday morning there was no information about what caused the crash.\n\"Until the investigation is concluded, we won't have answers,\" Webb said.\nWitnesses to the crash told Houston-area television stations that the Apache broke up in the air before it crashed into the water.\nMark Gonzales told Houston's ABC13 that he was fishing in the bay when the Apache approached the coast along a normal military training flight path.\n\"I could see the helicopter coming,\" he said. \"I heard an explosion, and I saw it crash.\"\nAir and boat crews for the U.S. Coast Guard responded to the crash with local and state fire and law enforcement agencies, according to the Texas Military Department.\nThe soldiers were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 149th Attack Helicopter Battalion, at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base near Houston, Webb said.\nHe said both pilots had extensive experience flying Apaches.\n\"Our pilots are very competent and they are well-trained,\" Webb said.\nThursday morning, search and rescue operations were continuing for the scattered remnants of the attack helicopter, an official said. Both pilots' bodies had been located, but it was not clear whether they had been recovered.\nLast year, the Army briefly grounded much of its helicopter fleet following fatal crashes during training missions, including an AH-64 Apache that wrecked in South Korea in November 2015.

Now travelers on certain international flights will be able to use their faces to check baggage and board their flight. Delta, Aeromexico, Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic Airways are the airlines using the technology for flights that operate out of Hartsfield's Terminal F.\n\"Delta's successful launch of the first biometric terminal in the U.S. at the world's busiest airport means we are designing the airport biometric experience blueprint for the industry,\" Delta CEO Gil West said at the launch last week.\nThe airline, which already had some of the technology in place leading up to the launch this month, said about 25,000 passengers move through the terminal each week and most are already taking advantage of the technology. Only about 2 percent of travelers opt out. West said Delta will expand the biometric program to its hub in Detroit next year.\nHere's how the system in Atlanta works: Passengers traveling through Terminal 7 enter their passport information when they check-in online. Then, when they approach a kiosk in the lobby, a camera at the counter in the lobby or the Transportation Security Administration security checkpoint they click \"Look\" when it appears on the screen. The device takes their picture - and if a green check mark flashes on the screen, they proceed through the system. Travelers' pictures are compared to a CBP database.\nAn increasing number of airports are using biometrics to process passengers as they move through the system. Dulles International Airport recently unveiled a system that uses iPads to scan passengers' faces before they board flights. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been using biometrics to track passengers entering the U.S.\nBut the practice has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates and civil libertarians who are concerned about the accuracy and potential misuse of the data being collected. While Congress has called for such systems, others worry that the United States is investing billions in a program that may not necessarily keep the nation safer.\nAirlines like Delta are betting that the convenience of a system that eliminates the need for passports and drivers' licenses will outweigh any privacy concerns of travelers.\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said biometric technology in place at Los Angeles International Airport has helped planes board more quickly. For example, officials were able to load an A380 with more than 350 passengers in less than 20 minutes \u2014 half the time it would normally take, he said."}

Kyle Dowdy.\nDowdy said the training has been in development for months and was not in response to last week's school shooting in Parkland, Flordia.\nThe participants attended a briefing by Farmington police at their building on Municipal Drive before heading to the training at the airport.\nIn the last 18 to 24 months, the agencies have devised a new multiagency policy and revisions to the policy regarding active shooters, according to Acting Fire Chief David Burke. Police Chief Steve Hebbe said the integration of emergency medical services and firefighters into the training has been a priority.\n\"We've created a better partnership there I think will serve the community well if we ever had any tragedy that we had to respond to,\" Hebbe said.\nDowdy described an active shooter as a suspect who continues to fire a weapon when police arrive on the scene.\nDuring the training, the participants run through three scenarios, including an active shooter inside a school and a workplace.\nPolice made entry to the hangar in an effort to neutralize the suspect. As officers swept the structure and assessed the injured, a team of paramedics and firefighters guarded by officers was escorted into the building.\n\"They are going into these building knowing full well that the shooter is still on the loose,\" Dowdy said. \"Any time, he could double back to the area.\"\nParamedics and firefighters tried to retrieve the mock victims and extract them to a casualty collection point. At that location, fire and medics tended to them and made decisions about what would happen next, Dowdy said.\n\"We need to get them into the hands of the medical experts as quickly as possible,\" Dowdy said.\nBurke echoed the statement, stating that is the biggest factor in saving lives.\n\"That's been the underlying factor of us working together,\" Burke said. \"The quicker we can get the injured out of the scenario into definitive care, the greater the survivability and lesser the ongoing injuries are.\"\nEach training session gives those participants something new to learn about the tactics deployed by police, authorities say.

Accounting for these divisions, global industrial players are demanding longer firmware lifecycles, as they realise that upgrades for a given solution may not be available for all devices across an enterprise every year.\nThis is why, when it comes to industrial mobility, it\u2019s critical to anticipate and plan ahead for mobile OS trends. For example, Windows Mobile (now Windows Embedded Handheld) and Windows CE (neither of which should not be confused with the new Windows Phone) are supported until 2020, but given the time it takes to develop, distribute, and support a solution used globally \u2013 and not to mention the long latency between upgrades \u2013 companies relying on these platforms had better already be thinking about the transition to their next OS.\nNeither enterprises nor industrial mobile app providers want to rely on or develop for Betamax in a VHS world, so to speak.\nAgainst this backdrop, it\u2019s critical to look at worldwide mobile OS trends and make informed predictions about user needs and how best to meet the global demand. When support for a platform ends, applications used by businesses need to be rewritten for a new platform.\nToday, there are easily 15 million enterprise devices in this position of being dependent on a legacy Windows OS with the clock running out on its support and in need of a replacement. In many ways this represents an opportunity: companies commissioning new industrial mobility apps can redesign to work in more current features such as multi-touch, gestures, current best UI practices, etc.\nThose forced to change from Windows Embedded Handheld or Windows CE to a new OS have options, including Windows 10 and Android, both of which will require a software re-build (unfortunately for users of Microsoft\u2019s products, a simple Windows-to-Windows update won\u2019t do the job).\nWindows 10 has been designed to meet the needs of enterprise, including enterprise-grade security, identity, and information protection features, and simplified management and deployment. As such, the OS could prove a viable enterprise option for those wishing to stay in the Microsoft camp (albeit with the aforementioned re-build if, coming from a sunsetting OS).\nBut that said: given the recent news that Microsoft is taking a $7.6 billion write-down of Nokia (including deep job cuts largely affecting the company\u2019s phone business), those prudently watching the industry must consider that this year\u2019s planned launch of Windows 10 Mobile may now be less certain. Windows 10 retains its strong promise as a major OS and a tablet OS, but in the mobile space it should currently be seen as just a potential candidate.\nAndroid, though, with nearly 80 per cent of the worldwide market according to IDC (iOS is a distant second with roughly 20 per cent of the market), is perhaps best positioned to be the dominant mobile OS in enterprise settings. Enterprise developers have been flocking to adopt Android: a Vision Mobile report finds that Android is now the OS most commonly targeted by enterprise developers, with iOS and HTML5 also used by the majority of developers (who, on average, develop for 1.75 platforms \u2013 and in the case of HTML5, develop code that is translated into native apps).\nAndroid has also risen to meet the needs of the enterprise by evolving into a more secure platform.

I\u2019ve always been interested in the natural world, so of course I felt drawn to him. But I think I identified most with Jane, to tell the truth, since she had more of a choice than Tarzan did. He was raised in the jungle, but she saw it as an adult and fell in love, ultimately choosing it, and Tarzan, over the culture she was born into.\nDW: Were there any tricks you employed to make the characters more appealing to a contemporary audience?\nCSB: I think there are timeless qualities to both Tarzan and Sheena that continue to appeal to audiences across the decades. Those include loyalty, self-sacrifice in the name of a good cause, commitment to protecting their homes and loved ones, and bravery. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a trick, but I lean into those as much as I can.\nDW: What did you find to be the biggest challenge in doing a crossover book of this type?\nCSB: In this case, it was that Tarzan and Sheena are alike in many ways. Both are heroic, understand animals and nature, and are willing to fight tooth and claw to protect what they believe in. Finding the drama and tension between them was challenging at first, until I realized that it was really their attitude and approach that defined a lot of their worldview.

I\u2019m going to go with Sheena, because she seems to have more rapport with more kinds of animals.

{"idx": "2023", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: February 23, 2015: The Russian government has agreed to pay for new AK-12 assault rifles as part of its new \u201cfuture soldier\u201d (Ratnik) set of gear for its infantry. The government is also increasing the order for Ratnik systems from 50,000 to 70,000. While the AK-12 fires the same 5.45/39mm round as the current AK-74 and costs 25 percent more, the new rifle has outperformed the AK-74 in extensive field tests and the troops prefer it over the AK-74. The AK-12 can also be provided in a version that fires the old AK-47 round (7.62x39mm) that was introduced in 1944 and is still popular in many countries. The AK-12 also keeps the basic design principles of the AK-47 alive into the 21 st century.\nThis all began with a Russian World War II veteran, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who came up with a brilliant rifle design that so impressed his bosses that they named it after him. AK means Avtomat Kalashnikova which literally translates as \u201cKalashnikov Automatic\u201d. This was no fluke. Kalashnikov had always been into mechanical things and grew up in Siberia where rural folk could own a rifle for hunting so he was familiar with how rifles operated in addition to be a mechanical genius. Kalashnikov was conscripted in 1938 and because of his small size was assigned to a tank unit. There his ingenuity and mechanical skills came to the notice of his superiors, who praised and encouraged him. He was badly wounded in combat in 1941 and while he spent six months recuperating came up with some brilliant ideas for a new rifle design, instigated by complaints he heard from wounded infantry soldiers. He wrote to the senior officers who had praised his skills before the war and was transferred to a weapons development organization. Among his many innovations and designs over the next five years was the AK-47, which began replacing all older infantry rifles in 1949. Kalashnikov died in 2013 but until the end he hunted and innovated, backing things like the Ratnik concept.\nThe Ratnik system is the Russian version of an American concept pioneered in the 1980s (\"Land Warrior\") and resulted in the introduction of new body armor, personal communications, wearable computers, night vision devices, and personal medical equipment. Several European countries have followed, especially the German Infanterist der Zukunft (\u201cInfantryman Of The Future\u201d), and Russia did the same but was stalled by cash shortages and debates over whether a new infantry rifle was needed. Unlike the United States, Russia included a new rifle design (AK-12) as part of its Ratnik gear. There was a lot of opposition to the AK-12 within the Russian high command, but at the troop level there was an even more vigorous and louder call for something to replace the Cold War era AK-74.\nThe entire Ratnik collection underwent final acceptance tests in late 2013. All the items of Ratnik (firearms, body armor, optic, communication and navigation devices, medical, and power supply systems plus uniform items including knee and elbow pads) have been tested and accepted. The new rifle was more of a problem until the government finally backed the AK-12. Initially only elite troops will get Ratnik while the"}

As part of the cost-cutting, it said it would sell its main post office building at 2000 Alston Way in Berkeley, and move to a smaller site. The announcement met with backlash from residents who wanted to preserve the building.\nActing on Alsup\u2019s instructions, the Postal Service initially sought to depose 21 city officials to elicit their \u201cthoughts and motives\u201d behind the adoption of the ordinance, after former Mayor Bates told a local newspaper it was \u201ca good way\u201d to block the building\u2019s sale.\nThe Postal Service claims the city rezoned the area to scare away buyers, who have refused to pay market rates for a building with restrictions on commercial use.\nBut Alsup on Thursday prohibited Department of Justice attorneys from asking officials about their intentions or motivations for passing the ordinance. He limited their depositions to the facts that led to its passage, their opinions about the land uses permitted by it, and communications between city officials and real estate brokers regarding the building\u2019s value and its proposed sale.\nBerkeley is represented by Andrew Schwartz with Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger in San Francisco.

South Korean reports say the explosion caused a large mushroom-shaped cloud in North Korea's Yanggang province, near the Chinese border.\nSecretary of State Colin Powell told the ABC television program This Week Washington does not believe North Korea has conducted a nuclear test. \"We have no indication that was a nuclear event of any kind. Exactly what it was, we are not sure,\" he said.\nHe added, though, that U.S. authorities are closely monitoring reports of increased activity at a potential North Korean nuclear-test site.\n\"There have been some activities taking place at some sites that we are watching carefully,\" he added. \"But it is not conclusive that they are moving toward a test or they're just doing some maintenance at that site. It is not conclusive.\"\nSouth Korean officials say they are now trying to confirm whether an explosion occurred. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put forth one theory for the recent cloud over North Korea, on CNN's Late Edition.\n\"There are all kinds of assessments that are going on,\" she said. \"Maybe it was a fire of some kind, a forest fire of some kind. But we do not believe at this point that it was a nuclear event.\"\nMs. Rice says the United States retains the option of using military force against North Korea because of its nuclear-weapons program. But she says President Bush is committed to pursuing a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis, through multilateral talks that also include South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.\n\"If the North Koreans were to test, and so far, we do not know if they are planning to, but if they were, they would simply isolate themselves further,\" she added. \"The international community has spoken with one voice about it, and most importantly, the United States is no longer, as it was with the Agreed Framework in 1994, in a bilateral agreement with the North Koreans. This is a six-party arrangement, in which North Korea's neighbors are saying that North Korea must abandon its nuclear-weapons programs.\"\nSpeaking on the NBC television program \"Meet the Press,\" former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said when the Clinton administration left office, it felt North Korea was \"the most dangerous place to deal with.\"\nShe blamed the Bush administration for not taking adequate action to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\"And I also think they [North Korea] get the wrong message out of Iraq. You know, we [the US] invade countries that do not have nuclear weapons and we do not invade those that do,\" she said. \"We did not invade the Soviet Union and China, so why not build up nuclear weapons as quickly as possible?\"\nMeanwhile, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Pat Roberts, acknowledged to CNN that other countries may question the credibility of U.S. intelligence, in the wake of the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\nBut Senator Roberts added that in discussions about North Korea on a recent visit to Beijing, Chinese officials raised no concerns to him about U.S. intelligence information."}

Eisenhower\u2019s defense secretary.\nThe adage has held for more than a century \u2014 even though GM these days is just a fraction the market value of Apple or Amazon.\nAs always, a recession is coming but we don\u2019t know when. The best guess among economists seems to be mid-2020, though downturns, like nor\u2019easters, tend to creep up the coast in unpredictable ways and sooner not a bad bet.\nThe good news is Connecticut is shielded from swings in the auto industry because we don\u2019t have much of it here, other than retail sales and a schmear of Loctite glue from Henkel Corp. And more broadly, we\u2019re probably not in for a deep recession; we could actually gain on the rest of the nation for a change.\nAs GM positioned it, this cutback of some 14,800 employees and $6 billion in annual spending is due to technology and lifestyle changes, not slumping profits and sales. GM remains reasonably profitable and needs to move toward more electric vehicles, more SUV\u2019s, more self-driving vehicles and far fewer traditional sedans, CEO Mary Barra said Monday, reassuringly.\nSo why are we nervous? First, cutbacks due to technology and lifestyle changes count. And GM posted a 9.8 percent decline in the third quarter in unit sales of cars and trucks in North America \u2014 highlighting excess capacity in auto plants across the industry.\nMore ominously for the economy, as wage pressures rise, President Donald Trump\u2019s reckless aluminum and steel tariffs pinch and a squeeze on profit margins tightens, job growth tends to shrivel.\nThat\u2019s what leads to recessions even when the economy seems like it\u2019s humming along. Things looked pretty good in 2006, when GM launched a cutback of some 35,000 jobs, citing out-of-control pension costs. Recall, by 2008 the company was in free-fall and in 2009 it filed the largest-ever bankruptcy for a manufacturer and needed a federal bailout.\nMandel is in the camp that says the next recession won\u2019t hit Connecticut as badly as elsewhere. So is Leo Karl III, the third-generation president of Karl Chevrolet in New Canaan, who heard about the cutbacks at Chevy\u2019s parent along with the rest of us Monday.\nLet\u2019s hope Karl\u2019s \u201cwe gave at the office\u201d rationale holds up when the tsunami hits.\nMandel adds that Connecticut\u2019s mix of industries generating growth these days \u2014 health care, private education and defense \u2014 are slightly more recession-proof than, say, the auto industry or publishing.\nAnd she said, companies in Connecticut have already pared expenses robustly. She added, \u201cDemographic trends are also going to be at play,\u201d as the parade people moving from here to other states could decline or even reverse.\nMandel\u2019s prominent boss, Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi, predicted a recession in the summer of 2020, in an October opinion piece on the CNN website.

Giants assistant general manager Bobby Evans said he got a call from Sandoval, who informed him he was leaving to play for the Red Sox.\nMany media accounts also reported the Red Sox and Ramirez coming to terms on a four-year, $88-million deal \u2013 with a $22-million vesting option for a fifth year. Ramirez will be 31 next month.\nThe Red Sox have confirmed neither agreement, but have called a press conference for 1 p.m. Tuesday.\nBecause Sandoval and Ramirez received qualifying offers from their previous teams, the Red Sox will have to forfeit two draft picks \u2013 in the second and third rounds. Boston\u2019s first-round pick is protected because the Red Sox finished as one of the 10 worst teams last year.\nSandoval, a switch-hitter, is a career .294 batter with an .811 OPS. But his OPS has gone down each of the past four years (.739 in 2014), signaling that the Red Sox are writing big checks for a player possibly in decline. Sandoval\u2019s weight (he\u2019s listed as 245 pounds) is also a concern.\nThe Ramirez deal is more of a gamble given his age, injury history, unpredictable demeanor and lack of a position.\nRamirez, originally a highly touted prospect for the Red Sox, played for the Portland Sea Dogs in 2004 and \u201905.\nWhile Ramirez is a shortstop, Boston has a young star-in-the-making, Xander Bogaerts, at short.\nBefore news of the Sandoval deal surfaced, it was thought Ramirez would play third base. Now it looks like he will go to left field \u2013 a position he has only played in winter ball.\nRamirez, a right-handed batter, is a career .300 hitter (.873 OPS). He batted .283/.817 in 128 games last year.\nBecause of injuries, he has played only one full season the past four years.\nRamirez has a history of run-ins with managers and management, going back to his minor-league days with the Red Sox. When he was in Class A ball in 2003, the Red Sox suspended him twice for boorish behavior. The Red Sox director of player development at the time was Ben Cherington, now Boston\u2019s general manager.\nRamirez came to Portland at the end of the 2004 season. He began 2005 at Hadlock but figured to be promoted during the season. But Ramirez underachieved (.271/.720) and stayed with the Dogs all year.\nHe received a brief call-up to Boston in 2005 (two at-bats, two strikeouts) and was traded in the offseason to the Marlins in a deal that brought Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell to Boston"}

The previous Thursday evening, Ivanka Trump walked onstage at the Republican National Convention in a sleeveless sheath dress of her own to introduce her father to the complementary post.\nChelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump, as has been noted, bear remarkable similarities. Only two years apart in age, they are impressively educated and hard-working women, with growing families, who have deftly navigated the thorny transition from famous children to famous adults. And while they have benefitted from their families\u2019 obvious dynastic qualities, they have also suffered through the pangs of public humiliation with extraordinary dignity. They are, indeed, their parents\u2019 best reflections, and it is little surprise that they were\u2014at least until recently\u2014real friends. Both were veritable no-brainers to introduce their parents to the awaiting party faithful.\nIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s unusual, of course, for presumptive First Daughters to introduce their parents; the Bush daughters accomplished the feat, albeit with less rhetorical flourish, for their dad in conventions past, too. (Though they were better than George Pataki in 2004.) But there is also something interesting in the fact that these particular women find themselves in the role of softening their parents, of propping them up and smoothing their images, at the same time, in the same election. After all, Chelsea and Ivanka have been essentially performing that function individually for decades. These are women who as little girls were thrust into the piping-hot media storms created by their parents\u2019 marital messes\u2014Ivanka caught by photographers on her way to school as her father\u2019s affair unfolded around her; Chelsea pictured sandwiched between her parents on the White House lawn, a bridge after her dad\u2019s even more public dalliance.\nChildren are often mirrors of their parents\u2014particularly children of narcissists\u2014and that dynamic was evident on both convention stages. Like Donald, Ivanka appeared as though she\u2019d been addressing millions of people, live, in prime time, with ease, for all her life. Her cadence felt natural, her tone vacillating between a quiet whisper to a trusted pal seated next to you at a dinner party and an executive commanding a room of people who work for her. Ivanka, like her father, is a born entertainer, which explains, in part, why he brought her on to co-host The Apprentice with him. (He has also spoken openly, and bizarrely, about her attractiveness.) Like her father, too, there wasn\u2019t much substance in her speech, and like Donald, much of it seemed to come out of nowhere. She noted two personal stories about her dad, both of which were largely unspecific, and went off on a minutes-long tangent about being a working woman, something her father has hardly addressed in his campaign and in fact once called a \u201cdangerous\u201d phenomenon. And like her father, she knows that the medium of television often rewards not what you say but the manner in which you proclaim it.\nOf course, the same contrast could be seen in the candidates\u2019 spouses\u2019 speeches, too. Melania Trump\u2019s brief address (parts of which were later found to be borrowed from another First Lady) praised her husband\u2019s work"}

The impacts can be transformative, according to SCMO Veteran Outdoor Coordinator Aaron Leonard.\nLeonard spent 28 years in the Army. He knows the difficulties some veterans have when they return from deployment.\n\"It's common for 30 percent of the population to take a nosedive when they return home,\" he said.\nPhysical injuries, PTSD, loneliness, and depression can be hard for veterans to deal with. Their friendships and relationships have changed because of their experiences. It can be hard fitting back into the world they left to join the service.\n\"Part of our mission is to reach those people,\" Leonard said.\nThe programs are all about fostering the physical, emotional and social health of the veterans by immersing them in nature.\nArmy veteran Sarah Hamby learned about the SCMO programs at a Round Up held at the Base Camp in 2017. In August 2017 she attended a leader training course. Hamby generally hikes alone, but was intrigued by the idea of sharing the trails she loves with other veterans.\n\"SCMO challenges veterans to get outside,\" she said. \"They remind us that there are public lands that are available for us to overcome fear, pain and isolation. We don't have to do it alone.\"\nAn SCMO program typically lasts seven days and includes 12 people. It's been Leonard's experience that day three is a turning point. That's when people start working together and relying on each other. That's when the emotional bonds start to form. That's when participants start to act like they've been together for a while.\n\"It recreates a small group team like they had in the military,\" Leonard said. \"When you feel like you're on a team it's a huge boost to how you feel about yourself. We want to recreate that in these outdoor trips.\"\nNature provides all of the challenges. Dealing with weather and bugs, crossing streams and scaling mountains, carrying all the supplies for the trip is physical and mental challenge enough.\nHamby agrees. She's participated in several SCMO programs including a leadership training course and a fly fishing course.\n\"The first few days people are settling in and trying to remember names,\" she said. \"By day three strangers may not be friends, but we are more comfortable with each other.\"\nSCMO tries to break down as many barriers as possible to get veterans outside. Because many veterans have trouble finding the time, transportation or money to attend the trips, SCMO provides gear and transportation. The Sierra Club funds the program with contributions from private foundations, individual donors and public companies.\nLeonard estimates 85,000 veterans and their families have benefited from the programs since 2006.\nPart of the experience is to teach people about the importance of environmental conservation and preservation.\n\"We want them to enjoy, explore and eventually protect these public lands,\" Leonard said. \"Everyone should have clean air and clean water.

Here are some new, highly pornographic photos and additional details on this marvelous piece of machinery.\nThe big news is that Infiniti\u2019s power goal for its diesel-killing 2.0-liter variable compression turbocharged four-cylinder is 268 horsepower, and the torque target is 287 lb-ft.\nAnd if you\u2019d rather not watch that, here\u2019s the gist: an engine can work most efficiently at high compression ratios, but sometimes at high engine loads (and high boost), that can yield pre-ignition and knock.\nSince Infiniti doesn\u2019t want to pull power to reduce knock when the driver gives it the beans (that kind of defeats the purpose), it created an engine that can vary the compression ratio via a \u201cmulti-link\u201d system.\nBasically, there\u2019s an electric motor that rotates a cam, which pushes an actuator arm, spinning a \u201ccontrol shaft.\u201d There\u2019s a lower link attached to that control shaft, which gets pushed and pulled when that shaft is spun (presumably because the lower link and the control shaft have off-set axes, just like throws on a connecting rod).\nThat pushed (or pulled) lower link yanks shoves the multi-link, which rotates about the crankshaft, pulling or pushing the upper-link to change how high the piston goes in the cylinder, thus altering the compression ratio. The piston goes higher in the cylinder (high compression) when the driver is light on the gas, and it\u2019s lower (for lower compression) when the driver is deep on the pedal to reduce the risk of pre-ignition.\nPlus, they say, it doesn\u2019t have the negative emissions of the diesel, and the Noise, Vibration and Harshness will be much better than the oil burner.

They did so with the 2005 film Syriana (in which George Clooney also starred), which examined the politics of oil and the far-reaching socio-economic effects on a people who are used as pawns in a bigger grab for power. Trading for Starvation would be in a similar vein, only this time the commodity is not oil, but the basic necessities of food and water.\nThis problem is a matter of life of death for hundreds of thousands of people as they cannot just turn on a spigot and have water run freely in these countries.

And though shares initially gave up much of that gain in the first few days of May, Pandora stock has more than recovered since as the market had time to digest its results.\nSo what: More specifically, Pandora saw quarterly revenue jump 29% year over year, to $297.3 million, above the high end of its previously supplied guidance of $280 million to $290 million, driven by a modest year-over-year increase in active listeners (up 0.3%, to 79.4 million), a 4% increase in total listener hours, to 5.52 billion, and 23% growth in advertising revenue, to $220.3 million, and incremental contributions from Pandora's recent acquisition of live events company TicketFly.\nThough that translated to an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $57.4 million in the quarter, Pandora's outlook similarly called for an even larger EBITDA loss of $75 million to $65 million.\nIn February, Pandora left shareholders nervous after it revealed it would incur these losses in the near term as it implements an ambitious plan to invest $345 million to scale infrastructure and build new lines of business, the latter of which should drive accelerated revenue growth starting as early as next year. Five years from now, Pandora also believes it can build a $1.3 billion subscription business as new product tiers are developed an launched -- an estimate conservatively based on converting around 10% of its current (still-growing) U.S. audience.\n\"Our team is rapidly bringing Pandora's audacious strategy to life,\" added Pandora's founder and CEO, Tim Westergren, \"fundamentally changing how listeners discover and enjoy music while helping artists build sustainable careers.\"\nNow what: If Pandora's relative outperformance in Q1 wasn't enough to get investors excited, its guidance pumped up the volume even more. For the full-year 2016, Pandora now expects revenue of $1.41 billion to $1.43 billion, up from its previous outlook for $1.40 billion to $1.42 billion. Pandora also now sees an improved adjusted EBITDA loss of $70 million to $50 million, compared to previous guidance for a loss of $80 million to $60 million.\nIn the end, Pandora's results may not look impressive on the surface.

When it\u2019s converted to methyl mercury by microbial processes, it can then accumulate in fish and wildlife in levels up to a million times higher than those in the environment.\nMercury, also, simply doesn\u2019t break down. It will remain in the environment continuing to increase in quantity and accumulating in the food chain.\nMercury enters the atmosphere through emissions from coal combustion, waste incineration, and mining. Once there, it drifts around for a year or so, until chemical processes make it soluble. It then falls to the earth in rainfall or snow. This happens worldwide, regardless of where the emissions are originally from.\nA lot of the mercury deposited in the Arctic snow and ice though, is later re-emitted into the atmosphere, limiting its impact on the Arctic Ocean.\nThe main rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean are all in Siberia: the Lena, the Ob, and the Yenesei. They are three of the ten largest rivers in the world, together accounting for 10% of the freshwater discharges into the world\u2019s oceans. And the Arctic Ocean is shallow and heavily stratified, furthering the impact of the rivers.\nPreviously it had been found that the level of mercury in the Arctic lower atmosphere varied seasonally, increasing sharply from the spring to summer. The research team used different computer models to investigate whether that variability was from melting ice, increased microbial activity, or sunlight.\nNone of those could account for the difference though. The only way to explain the variability was through the inclusion of a large source from circumpolar rivers.

And I am a little bit of a nerd about going around turning out lights and switching off appliances. I am not saying this not to bolster my tree hugging credentials\u2014our energy bills are actually quite high thanks to an old leaky house and two plug-in cars. Rather, I'm trying to explain why, even though I was excited about installing a Sense home energy monitor, I wasn't sure how much we would actually save.\n\"We did have a look and your suspicions are right. The dehumidifier did it. This plot shows you the point of change and how the baseline wattage drops on Dec 17. It drops from around 500 to 100 W. Your dehumidifier was actually using ~ 360W all the time --> 0.36kWh --> 8.6kWh/day --> assuming 10cents /kWh --> 86cents / day which is pretty close to the drop you saw.\"\nWhile they are yet to show up on my energy bill (we have a flat rate bill due to massive summer spikes), these savings are likely to add up fast and, if similar savings were achieved by others, they would easily pay for the cost of the monitor within a year or two. Of course, I could have simply walked around checking for appliances that had been left on\u2014but Sense provided both the impetus to do so, and some actual data about whether it was worth the effort.\nWhat's interesting to me\u2014although perhaps obvious\u2014is that as more devices get detected, it also becomes easier to figure out what's left under \"other\" or \"always on\". The majority of our lights, our fridge, our washing machine and both cars are yet to be detected\u2014for example\u2014but each of these devices are used quite differently, so I can easily look for spikes in those categories to figure out roughly how much my car is using, for example.\nTrue, Sense is certainly still learning and is far from infallible. I've still got a fair amount of mystery devices named \"Heat 1\" or \"Device 2\", etc. -- but many of these are relatively low consumption, so I'm not sweating too much about figuring out what they are. Which brings me to one more point: One of the unexpected benefits of installing Sense has been figuring out what NOT to worry about any more. Having been berated by tree hugging friends never to leave a phone charger plugged in, for example, I've done some playing around and now noticed that it's drawing less than a watt at any one time.

''We were interviewing an author, and we started talking about how so many of them -- Salinger, Shaw, Fitzgerald -- were really an odd bunch.

''Now, he can't sing like that,'' Mr. Im said.\nCutting back and forth between the performance and an illustration of the tale of a prince in love with a commoner, Mr. Im creates a quietly ravishing spectacle that bridges a considerable cultural gap.\n''I always wanted to make a unique Korean movie, something other countries couldn't do,'' Mr. Im explained through an interpreter.

It was a pleasant change since the medium, once a new frontier of hope, has been regarded with suspicion ever since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. We had spent years outraging over the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being conditioned by smart web advertising, and, in 2018, we learned that even voter choice was open to manipulation.

Because before the web, the net was full of command-line cowboys and cowgirls, most of whom had just come online, and were very hopeful and a little lost.\nTwenty-five years ago, before the visual web, which is like a picturesque window onto the internet, there was the internet itself in its raw, minimalist beauty \u2014 the beauty of the blank command line. It was beautiful if you knew what to type into it, and magically, a server on another continent would respond to your UNIX command. The command line is what Indians saw when they first accessed the internet in the mid-Nineties, with ordinary phone lines and modems with lots of flashing lights. If you were hip, it was a 14.4 Kbps modem. If you weren\u2019t, it was just 9.6 Kbps \u2014 in contemporary terms, about the speed of an incredibly slow Torrent that would take two weeks to download a pirated film. It was the era of internet evangelism in search of critical mass, led by personalities like Miheer Mafatlal (now indistinguishable from Merlin), Shammi Kapoor (then at home at father.junglee.org.in) and Vijay Mukhi. It was also the era of common folk who could not even afford an internet connection, and instead dialled into private bulletin boards to chat, download software and access email, the killer app of the internet for over a decade, until the birth of social media. People chatted and mailed a bit, and hardly ever surfed with the now-forgotten Netscape Navigator, whose genetic code lives on in Mozilla Firefox. Surfing was excruciating training in Zen patience, since download speeds of one byte per second were sometimes reported.\nThe archives of Pew Research reveal that even before the web became mainstream, net use was growing 10 per cent every month. Even in the days of the command line, the online world was teeming with newbies, who were feeling their way. Twenty-five years later, the world is again full of noobs, who do not understand how their data is being used by social media.

Pro-gun activists belonging to Open Carry South Dakota last month carried handguns, semi-automatic rifles, and shotguns into a Starbucks in Sioux Falls.\nBut the company in June banned people from smoking within 25 feet of its shops despite state policies that haven\u2019t enacted the rule.\n\u201cThey\u2019re picking and choosing when they\u2019re going to follow these state laws and policies,\u201d Watts said.\nWatts established the Indiana-based group one day after last year\u2019s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since then, the mothers have put pressure on legislators to enact gun-control laws. They held more than 20 marches and rallies around the country before the Senate\u2019s vote in April on bipartisan background checks legislation. The bill, which would have made it more difficult to buy guns from private sellers and on the Internet, failed 54-46.\nThe grassroots movement has grown in eight months to include more than 100,000 members with chapters in all 50 states. The mothers\u2019 goals include requiring background checks for all gun purchases, banning assault weapons that hold more than 10 rounds, and tracking the sale of large quantities of ammunition.\nSome of the group\u2019s mothers are owners of firearms and have been affected by gun violence, but others simply have a desire to be an activist, Watts said.\n\u201cI have never been affected by gun violence, but I\u2019m doing this because I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d said Watts, who is the mother of five children ranging in ages from 12 to 24.\nFamilies of victims killed in Newtown, Conn., have also called upon Starbucks to change its gun policies, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The individuals\u2019 request followed a confrontation last month between supporters of gun-control legislation and pro-gun advocates about the company\u2019s policy at a Newtown Starbucks."}

That\u2019s a big jump from the company\u2019s popular Nabi 2 tablet, which has a seven-inch screen. But Fuhu founder Robb Fujioka says the big screen size will encourage children to collaborate and socialize when they use their device, rather than tuning out the rest of the world.\nTo make the tablet into a social hub, Fuhu has developed a large suite of multiplayer games, from classics like checkers and Candyland to internally developed titles. A feature called \u201cStory Time\u201d offers 35 interactive e-books that utilize animated illustrations. Kids can also utilize video editing software, a Pandora-like radio service and educational software.\nThere are also tools for adults on the Android-powered device. A separate Parent Mode allows adults to download apps from the Google Play or Amazon stores. Parents can also set limits on which apps their children can access and for how long they can use them. Like Fuhu\u2019s other devices, the Big Tab also boasts a virtual currency system that lets parents pay their kids when they complete chores or use educational apps for a certain amount of time.\nThough the tablet market is only a few years old, the devices have been embraced by parents in a big way. Tablet usage among children between ages two and 12 increased from 38% to 48% over the last year, according to research firm NPD. Juli Lennett, head of the toys division at NPD, said it\u2019s a combination of safety, durability and kid appeal that has led to the quick popularity of children\u2019s tablets. \u201cWhen the price point is $99, on top of being a real functional tablet, these additional features are tough to beat,\u201d Lennett told TIME via email.\nStill, Fuhu is well positioned to prove skeptics wrong. The company sold 1.5 million of its normal-sized kids\u2019 tablets in 2013, says Fujioka. This year, Fuhu is leading the children\u2019s tablet market in the U.S., according to NPD, beating out competitors like Samsung and KD interactive. The question now is whether others will follow their lead in developing kids\u2019 devices that cost as much as an iPad or a video game console."}

Justices peppered attorneys representing both sides with pointed questions during the 40-minute-long arguments. The court will issue its decision in the coming months.\n\"This is a disqualification case in which lawyer and client have been pitted against each other, and that shouldn't have happened,\" attorney Darren Summerville, told the justices, arguing on behalf of his client, Brindle, and Cohen and Butters.\nIn this case, Brindle and her lawyers \"stand aligned,\" and she believes her lawyers have done \"a reasonable, or even excellent job,\" Summerville said.\nNot so, said Robert Ingram, a lawyer for Rogers, who sat in court watching the arguments with his wife Fran.\n\"This case presents the Supreme Court the opportunity to send what I think is a well-needed message to the bench and the bar, that if a lawyer assists a client ... in furtherance of illegal activity, trial courts have the authority to disqualify the lawyer from representing the same client in litigation arising from that illegal and criminal activity,\" Ingram said.\nBrindle secretly recorded the June 20, 2012, video of Rogers in compromising situations in the bedroom of his Fulton County home. She also filmed Rogers as he stood naked shaving his face in his bathroom, according to court records.\nDuring Monday's arguments, Ingram said Cohen had purchased the video camera for Brindle before she made the recordings and that investigators had warned Brindle's attorneys that secretly videotaping Rogers would be illegal.\nAt the outset of the case, Brindle accused Rogers of sexual harassment. Cohen also sent Rogers a letter with a \"host of horribles,\" advising him to end the matter with a financial settlement, Ingram said. Among Cohen warned that public disclosure of the sensitive sexual matter could lead to intrusive government investigations, criminal charges, incarceration, divorce and \"the destruction of families.\"\nBrindle's lawyers later demanded $12 million to settle the case, an offer Rogers rejected, court records show. Rogers has acknowledged he had \"infrequent sexual encounters\" with Brindle. But he denied sexually harassing her.\nRogers later filed a lawsuit against Brindle and her attorneys, alleging invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress. During this litigation, Cobb County Superior Court Judge Robert Leonard concluded that Brindle's videotaping of Rogers in his home has been illegal conduct.\nLeonard, who has since removed himself from the case, later granted Rogers' motion to disqualify Cohen and Butters from representing Brindle, finding they had a conflict of interest. If a criminal investigation ensued, there could be a situation were Brindle and the lawyers would be \"pointing fingers at each other about the planning of the video,\" Leonard said.\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals upheld Leonard's disqualification ruling, leading to the appeal heard Monday by the state Supreme Court.\nJustice David Nahmias questioned Summerville about the possible conflict of interest with regards to Brindle and her lawyers.\n\"There seems to be a lot of evidence in"}

They were also more likely to have a new or recurrent cardiovascular event during follow-up, the researchers found.\n\"Multiple studies from our group have shown that patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea throughout the world can be categorized into specific subtypes based on their reported symptoms,\" said study author Dr. Diego Mazzotti, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\"However, until now, it was unclear whether these subtypes had different clinical consequences, especially in regard to future cardiovascular risk,\" he said in a news release from the American Thoracic Society.\nFor the research, Mazzotti and his colleagues collected data on more than 1,200 adults older than 40 who had moderate to severe sleep apnea. As volunteers in the Sleep Heart Health Study, they were followed for nearly 12 years.\nThe participants reported symptoms such as difficulty falling and staying asleep, snoring, fatigue, drowsy driving and daytime sleepiness. They completed a questionnaire to determine in which group they belonged.\nThe findings indicate that a greater risk for cardiovascular disease is associated with patients in the excessively sleepy group.\nThis study, however, can't prove that daytime sleepiness causes cardiac disease, only that the two are related, the researchers noted.\nExcessive sleepiness could be a \"marker of underlying cardiovascular risk pathways,\" Mazzotti's group said.\nThe association, however, was independent of factors that could also affect the findings, including age, weight, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels and medications, the researchers said.\nThey believe their findings might guide future studies.\n\"Even without further research, clinicians should recognize that patients with obstructive sleep apnea who complain of feeling tired when they wake up and sleepy during the day are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease,\" Mazzotti said.\nThe report was published online Feb. 15 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\nThe National Sleep Foundation offers more information on sleep apnea."}

While Toyota&apos;s Detroit rivals have traditionally dominated the SUV segments, the Japanese giant has made very good inroads with its wildly popular compact RAV4 and midsize Highlander offerings. Highlander sales rose 10% while the RAV4 posted a 31% gain. Both were the models&apos; best-ever results in October. Their upscale siblings also had a good month: Sales of Lexus SUVs were up a combined 34% in October.\nToyota&apos;s midsize pickup, the Tacoma, has long been the class leader. It&apos;s facing stiff competition from new entries from General Motors, the Chevrolet Colorado, and GMC Canyon. Toyota has responded with an updated version of the Tacoma for 2016. Sales were very good in October, up 17% year over year.\nToyota&apos;s fuel-efficient offerings have suffered in comparison to its SUVs this year, not surprising given the trend in gas prices over the last 12 months. But after months of poor showings, its Prius hybrid line managed a 12.5% gain in October.\nSome credit for the Prius&apos;s success may be due to rival Volkswagen . Volkswagen&apos;s diesels were heavily marketed as \"green,\" fuel-efficient alternatives to gasoline-powered sedans -- and to hybrids. With sales of VW&apos;s diesels suspended in the U.S. amid a growing scandal, Toyota has had an opportunity to make inroads with VW&apos;s diesel loyalists. And with an all-new 2016 Prius set to arrive soon, good deals have been available on the 2015 models.\nBig gains for Honda&apos;s SUVs, tooMeanwhile, rival Honda also managed a good month, posting a 9.3% gain for its best-ever October in the U.S., again on brisk sales of crossover SUVs.\nHonda&apos;s compact CR-V is a direct (and fierce) rival to Toyota&apos;s RAV4. Sales of just over 29,000 were about the same as its (very strong) year ago result, but that may be a function of supply rather than demand. Demand has been brisk recently: The CR-V had its best-ever month in August, and a very strong September.

The moral blame falls exclusively on the perpetrators, who as of this writing remain unknown.\nThe tactical blame falls on the U.S. government, which has grievously failed in its topmost duty to protect American citizens from harm. Specialists on terrorism have been aware for years of this dereliction of duty; now the whole world knows it. Despite a steady beat of major, organized terrorist incidents over 18 years (since the car bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1983), Washington has not taken the issue seriously.\nSeeing terrorism as a crime. American officials have consistently held the view that terrorism is a form of criminal activity. Consequently, they have made their goal the arrest and trying of perpetrators who carry out violent acts. That's all fine and good as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. This legalistic mindset allows the funders, planners, organizers, and commanders of terrorism to continue their work untouched, ready to carry out more attacks. The better approach is to see terrorism as a form of warfare and to target not just those foot soldiers who actually carry out the violence but the organizations and governments who stand behind them.\nRelying too much on electronic intelligence. It's a lot easier to place an oversized ear in the sky than to place agents in the inner circle of a terrorist group, and so the Central Intelligence Agency and other information-gathering agencies have put on their headphones and listened. Clearly, this is not enough. The planning for the events that took place yesterday requires vast preparation over a long period of time involving many people. That the U.S. government did not have a clue points to nearly criminal ignorance. As critics like Reuel Gerecht keep hammering home, American intelligence services must learn foreign languages, become culturally knowledgeable, and befriend the right people.\nNot understanding the hate-America mentality. Buildings like the World Trade Center and the Pentagon loom very large as symbols of America's commercial and military presence around the world. The trade center was already once before attacked, in a bombing in early 1993. It should have been clear that these buildings would be the priority targets and the authorities should have provided them with special protection.\nIgnoring the terrorist infrastructure in this country. Many indications point to the development of a large Islamist terror network within the United States, one visible to anyone who cared to see it. Already in early 1997, Steven Emerson told the Middle East Quarterly that the threat of terrorism \"is greater now than before the World Trade Center bombing [in 1993] as the numbers of these groups and their members expands. In fact, I would say that the infrastructure now exists to carry off twenty simultaneous World Trade Center-type bombings across the United States.\"\nThe information was out there but law enforcement and politicians did not want to see it. The time has come to crack down, and hard, on those connected to this terror infrastructure.\nIf there is any good to come out of yesterday's deaths and trauma, it will be to prompt an urgent and dramatic change of course in U.S. policy, one that looks at the threat to the United States as a military one, that relies on human intelligence, that comprehends the terrorist mentality, and that closes down the domestic network of terror.\nAn easy assumption pervaded the airwaves yesterday that the morning's horrors will have the effect of waking"}
{"idx": "2112", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: LED-maker Cree debuts a 75-watt bulb that produces excellent soft white light but is 82 percent more efficient than an incandescent.\nCree, which supplies residential LED lightbulbs exclusively to The Home Depot, this week launched a 75-watt equivalent LED bulb. Based on the technology of its successful 60- and 40-watt replacements released earlier this year, this offering consumes just 13.5 watts while pumping out 1100 lumens of soft white light. That's an efficacy of 81.5 lumens per watt, which means it's about 82 percent more efficient than the equivalent incandescent.\nCree's family of LED lightbulbs is growing just in time for the death knell of the old incandescent. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a phaseout of 75-watt incandescents at the beginning of 2013. On January 1, 2014, 60- and 40-watt incandescents will join them, effectively ending their reign as the residential lightbulb of choice.\nStandard 40- and 60-watt lightbulbs make up around 80 percent of the residential market. But with its 75-watt replacement, Cree, which began life primarily manufacturing LEDs for other companies, continues its push for complete adoption of LED lightbulbs by the residential market.\n\"We want to replace all the bulbs in the house,\" says Mike Watson, Cree's vice president of corporate marketing. \"With this bulb, we were able to utilize all the advantages that Cree has being a vertically integrated company.\"\nThose advantages include the fact that Cree's 75-watt replacement part uses the same \"Filament Tower\" as the 60-watt counterpart. The tower acts as both a heat sink and an array of 10 LED bulbs that provide omnidirectional light similar to that of an incandescent. To get the extra lumens, Cree simply drove all the bulb's components a little harder. \"We were able to tweak everything that goes into the bulb to make it work\u2014the LEDs, the chips, the semiconductors,\" Watson says.\nThe extra power creates more heat that needs to be dissipated, so the 75-watt replacement has a larger heat sink than its 60-watt sibling. However, it retains the standard A19 bulb shape, whereas other 75-watt replacements have larger A21 profiles.\nCree's 75-watt replacement is available in a color temperature of 2700K, roughly equivalent to a typical \"warm white\" incandescent. It's completely dimmable with compatible switches, and comes with Cree's standard 10-year warranty, though its life expectancy is more than twice that.\nOf course, the upfront cost of LED technology continues to hinder its widespread adoption. Cree's 75-watt replacement currently retails at $23, though Watson expects it to receive the same Energy Star certification the Cree 60-watt has earned. If that happens, it will qualify for the same utility rebates that drove the price of Cree's other bulbs down to around $10\u2014and even less in some regions. And the long-term savings are real: This bulb could save you $1"}

The U.K. economy, which had been growing faster than any other Group of Seven nation before the referendum, is now growing slower than any other. In fact, Bloom estimates that the U.K. economy is about 1.5% smaller than it would have been without the drama.\nTheir Decision Maker Panel now includes top financial executives at about 6,000 U.K. businesses, large and small, that collectively employ more than 10% of the nation\u2019s private-sector workforce. About 3,000 companies participate in each monthly survey.\nFor the first two years after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, about 40% of the companies surveyed listed it as either their biggest source of uncertainty or one of their top three. The anxiety jumped sharply last fall, when a rebellion by hard-line Brexiteers within the Conservative Party suddenly raised the prospect that Britain wouldn\u2019t even be able to negotiate an orderly exit with the European Union. A \u201cno-deal\u201d exit would wreak havoc on both U.K. exports and imports.\nBy October 2018, 19% of the surveyed companies said Brexit was the top source of uncertainty, and another 29% said it was their second or third biggest worry. The anxiety was higher in export-heavy industries, such as manufacturing, as well as in industries such as construction that rely heavily on EU migrants. But the uncertainty is now fairly widespread: Roughly half of all companies with more than 100 employees list Brexit as one of their top three worries. On average, companies in the survey estimate that Brexit will eventually reduce their sales by 2.5%.\nFor a long time, in fact, many of the usual indicators of investor anxiety were surprisingly tranquil.

He had already authored quite a month, abruptly announcing his \u201clast ride\u201d before the Ravens\u2019 first playoff game and then shimmying through his final squirrel dance at M&T Bank Stadium.\nThe biggest fear going into Super Bowl week was that Lewis would face rehashed questions about his murder trial 13 years earlier. But on Tuesday, Sports Illustrated upended expectations with a report alleging that Lewis, in attempting a rapid comeback from a triceps tear suffered that October, had obtained a \u201cdeer-antler\u201d spray containing the banned substance IGF-1.\nThe story made a minor celebrity of 37-year-old Mitch Ross, who said he\u2019d supplied Lewis from his Alabama business S.W.A.T.S., or Sports with Alternatives to Steroids.

That quickly changed in the 1980s with the rise of cable, first with lower-quality schlock then moving into top-quality programming on premium channels like HBO. Now, high-end shows can be found not only up and down the television dial, but also on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime, and a handful of other services.\nOriginal content has become a very crowded space, but its ability to attract eyeballs makes it attractive even though it has become much harder to actually do that. In a world where people already have an unprecedented wealth of choices on Netflix alone, the idea of entering the original content space seems foolhardy.\nBut that has not stopped companies from trying, even if original content airing on places like Verizon's Go90 service have had little, if any, success. Now it appears that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has plans to become a player in original content while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has put its toe further into the water.\nStarbucks has a new animated show, 1st & Main, from three Simpsons writers. Image source: Starbucks.\nFacebook has been dancing around the edges of the scripted content space for the past few years. The platform, for example, aired the premiere episodes of HBO's Ballers and The Brink in 2015. That deal not only let the pay cable channel try to entice subscribers by showing them two highly anticipated shows for free, it got people used to the idea of watching scripted shows on the social media platform previously known for short videos.\nNow Facebook has reached out to television studios and other video producers about licensing shows, Recode reported. These are not Game of Thrones-level deals or even ones in line with Amazon's or Hulu's efforts to produce high-quality shows on smaller-than-normal budgets by offering creators more freedom than traditional TV. Instead, the social media leader appears to be looking to explore different formats.\n\"Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the [Video] tab, so we're exploring funding some seed video content, including original and licensed scripted, unscripted, and sports content, that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook,\" company executive Ricky Van Veen told Recode. \"Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world.\"\nStarbucks entered the original content space in September with Upstanders, a show that offered 10 stories, \"each told in written, video and podcast form, about ordinary people doing extraordinary things to create positive change in their communities,\" according to a press release. At the time, the series was presented as an effort to counteract the \"divisiveness and cynicism currently fueling our national discourse.\" The episodes were available on the Starbucks website.\nAnd while creating an original television-style show may have been a new move for the company, its message was in line with other efforts supported by the chain. Now, Starbucks has announced a new original content effort, 1st & Main, a series of 90-second animated shorts \"highlighting warm and familiar everyday moments that happen in Starbucks stores across the country,\" according to a press release."}

Mr. Christie and some officials at Port Authority have said the closings were done as part of a traffic study, but they caused havoc for days, backing up traffic for hours.\nMr. Christie's handpicked chairman of the Port Authority, David Samson, was also involved in the closings, according to the emails, which describe his efforts to \"retaliate\" against New York officials who had not been told of the changes and sought to ease the gridlock.\nWhile the emails do not establish that the governor himself called for the lane closings, they do show his staff was intimately involved, contradicting Mr. Christie's repeated avowals that no one in his office or campaign knew.\nThat conflicts with the governor's carefully crafted reputation as the rare politician who will tell it like it is, even when the news is difficult. And the pettiness described in the emails flies against the image Mr. Christie's aides have sought to craft for him, of a new kind of leader, above the partisan politics and small-mindedness of Washington.\nAfter the emails were released, Mr. Christie canceled his one public event for the day, which had been billed as an announcement of progress in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy.

Nearly 7,000 starter snaps walked out the door, with the biggest blow happening to the offensive line. Branden Albert, Geoff Schwartz and Jon Asamoah all signed big deals elsewhere. Last year's No. 1 overall pick Eric Fisher will replace Albert at left tackle, and the early results aren't promising. The Chiefs have to be worried.\nThe best change possible would be for Kansas City's pass rush to dominate, like it did early last season. The Chiefs completely changed personalities in the second half last year, going 2-6 down the stretch with an explosive offense and disastrous defense.\nThe Chiefs risk asking Alex Smith to do too much. He played very well down the stretch last season, but he's been hit hard and often this preseason after all the offensive line changes. Andy Reid is a great offensive coach and Smith impresses us more every time he plays with his ability to deliver under pressure. But the Chiefs' receivers are average even in a best case scenario. Dwayne Bowe is a lackluster No. 1 receiver that has had ups and downs at camp. Donnie Avery is stretched as a No. 2, and the Chiefs are very thin at wideout after that.\nThe Chiefs still have MVP candidate Jamaal Charles to carry the show, and they should remain one of the best screen teams in the league. But Reid knows you occasionally have to pass downfield to win.\nSecond-year tight end Travis Kelce and rookie De'Anthony Thomas look enticing, adding a much-needed dose of big play ability. Kelce has two long touchdowns in as many weeks. He looks like a 260-pound wide receiver, while Thomas could be the X-factor that Dexter McCluster never was.\nRon Parker has lined up as a starter at cornerback for much of camp, which is a big surprise. Even if he moves down the depth chart, Parker and Marcus Cooper could get picked on by division rivals Peyton Manning and Philip Rivers.\nPredicted finish: Third place in AFC West, 19th in Around The NFL's Power Index.\nThe latest \"Around The League Podcast\" recaps all of the action from the second week of the preseason."}

Now players can experience various workplace scenarios as their Sim gets new playable professions like architectural designer, firefighter, ghost hunter, private investigator, and stylist. There are some great choices which will likely expand to more professions in the future. The already established career tracks stay intact while medical professionals can enjoy some new interactions.\nWork can be always be fun in this second expansion pack, which integrates several elements from the core The Sims 3 game and the first expansion, World Adventures, as well as drawing inspiration from the previous Sims 2 \u2013 Open For Business expansion pack. Considerate game developers include great elements in every area from previous Sims game like the basement building option previously introduced in World Adventures.\nIn the pack you can enjoy a whole new town called Twinbrook where players can modify lots in the Edit Town mode. The available modifications are now enhanced by the addition of variable roof pitch, which solves past issues that never really affect the interior, but became an eyesore outside.\nOther improved game elements also include lucrative business partnerships and real estate deals plus three new skills \u2014 inventing, sculpting, and tattooing. The new consignment store lets Sims sells their works, which include nectar from World Adventures.\nThe three new skills create deep experiences and entertaining scenarios. New inventions range from practical household items like the floor hygienator to the futuristic Sim Bot (a.k.a. Servo). Sculptors can create works from clay, ice, metal, stone, and wood while tattoo artists use the human body as their canvas. This last one is a great way to create customized designs and see finished works up close because players can model them on Sims the same way they experience clothes and other fashions in the character creator.\nThe limited playable professions seem likely to expand with more online or future expansion packs. Players can switch jobs easily and experiment with positive and negative reactions, which has always been one of the strongest appeals of this amazing \u201csandbox\u201d simulation series.

Chris Christie only allows Tesla to operate four direct-sale stores in the entire state. With new leadership in Trenton, the company is pushing lawmakers to consider legislation that would increase Tesla\u2019s dealership cap, a Tesla representative told POLITICO.\nThe move is bound to draw the ire of the state\u2019s powerful car dealership lobby, which has staunchly opposed Tesla\u2019s efforts to circumvent the traditional dealership model by selling directly to customers.\nA Tesla representative first met personally with Gov. Phil Murphy during the Democrat\u2019s first week in office in 2017, POLITICO previously reported. That same year Tesla signed a $60,000 contract with the River Crossing Strategy Group to lobby in New Jersey on \u201ctransportation and renewable energy issues,\u201d according to lobbying disclosure documents.

Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, according to lobbying disclosure documents. A few months later, River Crossing met with the governor\u2019s office and state Sen. Vin Gopal, the majority conference leader. The lobbying group also met with state Sen. Joseph Lagana \u2014 a Democrat whose district includes Paramus, the location of one of Tesla\u2019s four existing stores \u2014 in the second quarter.\nLagana said a portion of his conversation with Tesla included the company\u2019s desire to expand its retail locations in the state. Lagana said he isn\u2019t opposed to Tesla expanding \u201cif it\u2019s done the right way,\u201d but isn\u2019t working on a bill to revisit the cap.\nGopal said Tesla did bring up its desire to expand its retail presence in the state during their meeting, but that he had some concerns with the proposal.\nSarlo said Tesla also met with him to discuss retail expansion and said \u201cit\u2019s something to consider\u201d as the electric vehicle market grows and Tesla works on making its cars more affordable.

{"idx": "2134", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Get an easy-to-understand view of the healthcare program millions rely on.\nMedicare provides essential medical benefits for tens of millions of Americans. Although the program can be extremely complicated, there are some simple numbers that nearly every Medicare participant should keep in mind. Below, we'll look at five of them and explain what you need to know about each one.\n65 years old is the age at which you become eligible for Medicare. This causes some confusion, as the full retirement age on Social Security has risen to 66 and will rise further to 67 in future years. At least for now, though, calls to increase the eligibility age for Medicare haven't led to legislative action.\nTo apply for Medicare, you can complete an online application on the Social Security website. This works even if you haven't or don't want to apply for Social Security benefits at the same time. You can also find useful information there about your application options for both Social Security and Medicare and how you can coordinate the two programs in your retirement planning.\nMedicare Part B medical coverage charges participants a monthly premium. Most Medicare participants paid $104.90 per month for Part B premiums in 2015.\nIn 2016, the majority of those covered under Medicare will keep paying that same $104.90 monthly amount, thanks to legal provisions that prevent premium increases for Part B when there is no cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security benefits for the year. A lack of price pressure kept inflation under check in 2015, and that led to the lack of a COLA and the corresponding freeze on Part B premiums.\nHowever, some participants, including new enrollees and those whose premiums are paid by state Medicaid programs, didn't get the benefit of what's known as the hold-harmless provision. As a result, they will see their Part B premiums rise 16% to $121.80 per month. Over time, this disparity should disappear, but it could take several years to do so simply because of how big the difference is right now. Indeed, the difference would have been much larger -- more than 50% -- without congressional action to prevent a bigger increase from taking place.\nMedicare Part A hospital coverage doesn't charge a premium, but it does require a deductible for inpatient hospital care. For 2016, that amount will rise to $1,288, up $28 from its 2015 level.\nThe deductible is the only thing patients pay for the first 60 days of covered hospital expenses, with Medicare picking up the rest. After that, participants must make a copayment of $322 per day for the 61st to 90th days of their hospital stay. Beyond 90 days, participants must use up their 60 lifetime reserve days, for which a copayment of $644 per day is due. All told, Medicare covers a huge amount of hospital expenses even once these copayments start taking effect.\nMost prescription drug plans under Medicare Part D come with what's known as a coverage gap, which is also known as the donut hole. This provision represents the point at which Medicare's initial coverage stops covering drug expenses but before catastrophic coverage provisions kick in. For 2016, the coverage gap begins once the combined total that you and your plan have paid on covered pharmaceuticals reaches $3,310.\nOnce you hit the coverage gap, you're responsible for covering 45% of the plan's"}

Middleton in-bounded to Gideon Gamble from the side, then dashed through a pair of baseline screens to get a relatively clean look at the basket. It was similar in theme to the play they ran for Andre Jones at G-W in December, but Jones' shot was contested and didn't go in, leading to the 62-60 loss there.\nPeele put this wrinkle in near the end of Wednesday's practice, then reminded his guys about it pre-game.\nThe coach said the extra time-out the Bulldogs took when they saw the set helped, giving him one more chance to give directions.\nAsked what the play was called, Valentine looked embarrassed.\n\"I don't"}

It marked a slowdown in hiring, after July and August were revised significantly higher.\nThose revisions added 86,000 more jobs than originally reported in the summer.\nEver since the financial crisis, the monthly jobs report has been the most intensely watched economic indicator, but in election season, attention surrounding the numbers has reached new heights.\nThe Labor Department collects the data monthly, using both a survey of employers and a smaller survey of households. The two surveys don't always tell the same story on the first read, but over time, the data is revised to reflect more comprehensive information.\nIn the most recent household survey, the biggest hiring gains came in the form of 582,000 new part-time jobs in September. Part of that number can be explained by young workers, ages 16 to 24. The data show this age group saw a huge pickup in jobs in September, due almost entirely to seasonal adjustments by the Labor Department.\nMeanwhile, the employer survey showed the health care sector added 43,500 jobs, transportation and warehousing added 17,100 jobs and restaurants and bars added 15,700 jobs. Manufacturers cut 16,000 jobs -- the second month in a row they've slashed workers.\nThe government added jobs for the third month in a row.\nCommentators from both sides of the political spectrum were quick to jump on the numbers Friday morning as both a sign that the job market has improved recently, and that economic growth remains far too slow to pull millions of Americans out of unemployment.\nAlthough the unemployment rate is right back to where it was when Obama entered office, the U.S. economy has still not recovered all the jobs lost before his inauguration.\nOf the 8.8 million jobs lost during the financial crisis, about 4.3 million have been added back. The Labor Department signaled last week that it may revise the job gains higher, but even so, the job market still has a long way to go before it's fully healed.\nAbout 12.1 million people were unemployed in September, and 40% of them have been so for six months or more.\nThe so-called \"underemployment rate,\" which includes people who are working part time for economic reasons, and those who have recently stopped looking for a job, was 14.7% in September.\nMost economists expect the economy to remain slow for the foreseeable future, growing around 2% a year through 2013.\nGrowth at that rate is consistent with about 150,000 jobs created each month -- just enough to keep up with population growth."}

Atlantic Therapeutics presented key data from its pivotal US trial showing 87.2% of patients were dry or mild of after a 12-week treatment period1, with 93% of patients experiencing improvement in just 4 weeks1. This follows the presentation of data from an earlier sham-controlled RCT conducted in Europe that demonstrated significant improvement across all study endpoints2.\n\u201cFor the first time, physicians in the U.S. can offer their patients a safe, clinically effective, non-invasive home-based treatment,\u201d said Steve Atkinson, CEO, Atlantic Therapeutics.\nWith an estimated one third of all U.S. females affected by SUI3, the market potential for INNOVO\u00ae is significant, making this big news for the Galway, Ireland, based medical device manufacturer. With recent widespread reports of mesh surgery complications, this is an ideal time to offer a non-invasive option. INNOVO\u00ae has an excellent safety record to date, with over 1.5 million therapy sessions delivered by INNOVO\u00ae in Europe and no reported device related complications.\nMary Lynne Van Poelgeest-Pomfret, President of the World Federation of Incontinence Patients (WFIP) said, \u201cWFIP is excited to hear that INNOVO\u00ae has received FDA clearance, enhancing treatment choice for U.S. patients. We are confident it will change people\u2019s lives; INNOVO\u00ae therapy is fully supported by the WFIP.\"\nINNOVO\u00ae has been well received by many U.S. organisations and healthcare professionals concerned with the welfare of patients with incontinence.\n\u201cINNOVO\u00ae offers a new frontline therapeutic option for the millions of American women living with stress urinary incontinence, and in a significant group could delay or prevent the need for higher risk surgery or medical intervention,\u201d said Elizabeth LaGro, Vice President, The Simon Foundation for Continence.\n1.

The No. 1 question that keeps coming in via email and on Twitter is will the Bears fire John Fox and anoint an interim head coach for the remainder of the season?\nFolks have wondered about it for a while and the public demands, rarely something clubs pay particular attention to, are escalating. Before, the first thing I remind people is that the Bears, to my knowledge anyway, have never replaced a head coach during the season. If chairman of the board George McCaskey didn\u2019t demand a change during 2014 when the Bears were outscored 106-37 in consecutive losses to the Patriots and Packers, he\u2019s not going to do anything now, right? Nothing the Bears will stoop to under Fox is going to be as ugly and messy as things got near the end of the Marc Trestman era when you had then offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer breaking bad on quarterback Jay Cutler in private remarks to media and then outing himself as the source of the remarks in a meeting in front of the entire offense. Trestman had no control, commanded next to no respect and the entire thing had run amok. There\u2019s no chance things get that sordid here in the final five weeks.\nThe second thing I would urge you to keep in mind is that while the Bears are 3-8 right now and destined for a fifth consecutive non-winning season, that doesn\u2019t mean the final record will not look a fair bit better. They have remaining games with the 49ers (1-10), Bengals (5-6), Lions (6-5), Browns (0-11) and Vikings (9-2). It\u2019s quite possible the Vikings will have nothing to play for in the season finale at U.S. Bank Stadium on Dec. 31 and if that\u2019s the case, well anything is possible. If your expectations were for much more than a six-win season for the Bears, you\u2019re probably guilty of sipping the Kool-Aid during the offseason, listening to the wrong folks or perhaps both. They could still hit 6-10 even with a rough midseason stretch where they went from looking like they had turned the corner to really hitting the skids.\nCould it happen? Could the Bears pull the trigger on Fox in a move that would put them on the hook for his salary for the remainder of this season and all of next year? Well, that would be one very large parting gift. I suppose there is a chance the Bears make a move but the only case I can make for this happening is if general manager Ryan Pace (and/or McCaskey) believe that Fox has lost the team. Pace certainly doesn\u2019t want to see a string of blowout losses pile up. If that happens, and that\u2019s probably partially what got former GM Phil Emery axed at the end of the 2014 season, Pace could come under a high degree of scrutiny at the end of the season. Make a move now and have more ugly losses follow and the target could expand.\nThe Bears lost eight of their final 10 games in 2014 to finish 5-11. Of those eight losses down the stretch, six were by 13 points or more. Emery\u2019"}

{"idx": "2149", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Nigeria is spoken of as an economic equal to SA on the continent, at least measured by gross domestic product. But big-picture stats like GDP can be misleading. Nigeria has been battling ever since 2015, when the oil price crashed from more than $100 a barrel to below $40 a barrel, eventually settling at about $50 a barrel. Hard as it is to believe of a country with a population more than double SA\u2019s, Nigeria is largely a single-commodity economy \u2014 relying on oil for more than 80% of its exports.\nIt is a country of contradictions too. Despite being blessed with immense economic potential, much of Nigeria\u2019s creaking infrastructure dates back to colonial times and its economic hub, Lagos, is one vast, unending traffic jam. It can take six to seven hours to travel the few kilometres from the international airport to the city.\nIn 2016 Nigeria was the biggest exporter of oil in Africa and the 13th largest in the world. Absurdly, due to a lack of refinery capacity, it imports more than 90% of its daily requirement of 40Ml. Price caps have led to shortages and long queues at filling stations.\nMuch the same contradiction applies to rice, the staple food in Nigeria. The country, says the UN, is one of Africa\u2019s largest producers of rice, but also one of the world\u2019s largest rice importers.\nNow, desperate for hard currency, Nigerian regulators have tried to fine SA telecoms giant MTN $10bn for supposedly transferring $8.1bn out of Nigeria \"illegally\" over several years, as well as owing $2bn in back taxes.\nThe dispute has caused MTN\u2019s share price to slump by a third, to R72 \u2014 a level it was last at back in 2006. MTN\u2019s investors are already scarred by a previous penalty levied in October 2015, when MTN agreed to hand over $1.2bn after originally being fined $5.2bn for not disconnecting 5.1-million unregistered SIM cards.\nMTN admitted to its error in the 2015 case, but the feeling was that the penalty was heavily disproportionate to the offence \u2014 and linked to the oil price crash the same year.\nThis time MTN is adamant that it has done nothing wrong. CEO Rob Shuter has said that the Nigerian central bank appears to be fixated on dividends that MTN withdrew legitimately from the country.\nThen the Nigerian unit of Standard Bank was fined R75m for issuing \"irregular\" certificates of capital importation to MTN Nigeria between 2007 and 2015. Last week, that amount was simply removed from Standard\u2019s Nigerian account, even though Standard is appealing the fine.\nThis is no way for a country to do business. As Vestact\u2019s Paul Theron has said: \"This pathetic, nationalistic and immature attitude will severely weaken Nigeria\u2019s economy in the years to come. MTN has been their most committed foreign investor in recent decades, by a mile. Thanks to these acts of wanton highway robbery, no large corporate will commit to building a serious business in Nigeria.\"\nWe have to ask what our diplomats are doing to protect our companies against this bullying.\nIt appears that Nigerian domestic politicking could be behind the Nigerian raids on MTN and Standard, generating a kind of business xenophobia against foreign companies.\nLet"}

But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video \u2014 the one you see right up there \u2014 in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in its dust. Here's the video they made \u2014 the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our most famous city's iconic landmarks.\nKen Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia \u2014 so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia. In Sydney in particular, according to Jalopnik, who say that the Hoonigan racing team were denied a permit to film stunts in and around the Sydney CBD and across the Harbour Bridge, with police deeming the shutdown for the stunts \"not possible\". Gymkhana Seven, though, was filmed in Los Angeles \u2014 closing part of the city for a couple of days \u2014 as was Gymkhana Eight in Dubai.\nHoonigan's Matt Tuccillo told Jalopnik that \u201cthe police down there started to make things difficult with the permitting process for the locations we were trying to secure, both public and private. Apparently we were going to be 'bad' for Australia and as we got closer and closer to filming we started to lose more and more locations that we had secured, ultimately forcing us to abandon the concept.\u201d Hoonigan even offered to film and publish a high-profile public safety announcement for NSW Police speaking out against unsafe driving, but that wasn't enough.\nIf you ask me, Australia really missed out on being part of this one. It's awesome.\nIn a way, you can kinda see the old bills side of it but in true fashion they have unintentionally given it more oxygen, as is the way of these things.\nA bit narrow minded to only scope Sydney for locations though. Daniel Andrews would have fast-tracked the approval process to film in Melbourne just so he could stick it up Baird.\nHA ha, you might be right there!\nBut if you talk to anyone outside of Australia, and they ask the question \"Where are you from?\" and you respond with \"[Insert any location in australia here]\" they then immediately ask \"Is that near Sydney?\"\nYou've proved the point - they had their heart set on Sydney and nothing else. A nice aerial shot humming along the Great Ocean Road might have done the trick (or shut down part of the 12 Apostles car park) to get the shots needed. I didn't see anything particularly 'iconic' in the video which - I anticipate - they were probably hoping for in filming in Sydney - internationals are always going to recognise the Opera House cf. the Arts Centre - but the tie-in with Forza is kind of lost in another generic \"Ken Block does burnouts\" video.\nNot going to disagree with you. Lot's of great places to do this in Aus, and the more exposure it gets the better. But realistically the point of the video is not \"Lets advertise Australia\" its \"Lets do sick donuts etc around well known buildings etc because we can\". That's why he's been doing these in major cities like LA and San Fran previously.\nFun video of a car going fast. The bits spinning around in a big circle are mind numbingly boring however.

It has been discussed extensively in media in the Netherlands,\" the minister said in New Delhi.\n\"It should not however, have a negative impact on warm and friendly relations between India and the Netherlands. We have a great relationship going on,\" said van Gennip, who visited India recently to promote the Netherlands as the preferred destination of investment.\nExtolling the \"multi-racial, multi-cultural ethos\" of Dutch society, she underlined that immigrants comprise nearly half the population in Amsterdam. \"Amsterdam is a mixture of various cultures. We are a very tolerant society.\"\nLate last month, two Dutch F-16 fighters escorted a Mumbai-bound Northwestern Airlines plane after the pilot complained of suspicious behaviour by some Urdu-speaking passengers sporting long beards. Later, 12 Indian Muslims were detained and interrogated by the Dutch authorities.\nThey were later released after they were found to be innocent. New Delhi saw it as racial targeting and protested to the Dutch government over harassment inflicted on Indian passengers.\nDuring her visit to India last week, the Dutch minister, aware of the damage that such an incident can cause on developing bilateral ties, made it a point to stress that there was no discrimination against Indians travelling to the Netherlands.\n\"People of India are very welcome to the Netherlands. We are your oldest business partner. So, we have a lot to gain from this partnership. Let us build on this partnership in technology and innovation,\" she said.\nThe minister was unstinting in her praise of India's emergence as a \"geopolitical powerhouse\" and its redoubtable economic prowess, especially in the area of technology and innovations.\n\"India has taken the lead in promoting entrepreneurial culture. A lot of people in the Netherlands admire the entrepreneurial spirit of Indians,\" said the Dutch minister, who came here with a large business delegation to attract Indian investment.\n\"I wanted to come and see India, which is emerging as a geopolitical powerhouse. It is emerging as an economic power and the leader of the region.\n\"You have established yourself as the back office of the world. You are also one of our friends. You are the largest democracy. We have the same entrepreneurial spirit. We can learn something from each other,\" she waxed eloquently.\nProjecting the Netherlands as the \"best place for Indian companies to access the European market\", van Gennip underlined strategic advantages of investing in her country.\n\"For an Indian company, the Netherlands is the gateway to Europe. You can access the European Union market from there.\n\"There are many advantages of investing in Europe. Most people speak English, the country has an attractive fiscal climate and excellent infrastructure. The Netherlands has mostly profited from globalisation. Globalisation is also good for India,\" she said.\nBut for the minister the passage to India - her first visit to the country - turned out to be full of illuminations.\n\"The mystique is there in everything, but it is at the same time a very modern country.

{"idx": "2166", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: President Nixon had prepared a speech he would have given if the Apollo 11 mission had ended in tragedy. Fortunately, it didn't. But, says disaster expert Lee Clarke, only by imagining catastrophe can we cope with it.\nOn the night of July 20 1969, 500 million people tuned in to watch the first humans walk on the moon. During the historic broadcast, President Richard Nixon spoke to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. \"Hello, Neil and Buzz, I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House,\" said Nixon drearily.\nBut the haunting words advisers had also prepared for the president, written by speechwriter William Safire, were ones that anticipated the worst for Apollo 11. And to do so, officials had had to engage their imaginations in horrible ways. To imagine Armstrong and Aldrin stuck on the moon, they must have recognised that various failures could prevent the lunar module from lifting off. They had to have envisaged how the astronauts might die.\nAnticipating worst-case scenarios entails trying to see the future. There is a moment in Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach, which is about the last days of a group of people in Australia following a nuclear cataclysm, when a young Australian naval officer is talking to a scientist, who has been explaining the progress of radiation poisoning. The officer finds it hard to believe that everything human is about to end - \"I suppose I haven't got any imagination ... It's, it's the end of the world. I've never had to imagine anything like that before.\"\nIf this scenario seems too remote, consider this. The Thule air base in Greenland is a vital link in the United States' early warning system. In the late 1950s, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) became concerned that Thule might be destroyed before SAC knew what had happened. If that occurred, they would lose a key aspect of early warning, giving the Soviets a vital advantage in a nuclear first strike. SAC's solution to this potential risk was a programme called Operation Chrome Dome. The idea was to keep a B-52 with advanced communication capabilities in the air around the clock over Greenland and North America. The plane also carried nuclear warheads. The reasoning was that even if Thule was wiped out, SAC would still have defences and communications.\nIn January 1968, a fire on a Chrome Dome B-52, with four 1.1-megaton thermonuclear bombs on board, robbed the plane of electricity. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out, and the pilotless, burning nuclear hazard passed directly over the Thule air base and slammed into the ice seven miles away at 500mph. The 225,000lb of jet fuel and the high-powered conventional explosives in the nuclear devices exploded. Radioactive debris was spread over a wide area. Fortunately, none of the thermonuclear weapons detonated.\nThe outcome could easily have been otherwise. What if the burning B-52 had crashed directly into the communications centre at Thule? Norad wouldn't have been able to talk to the air base, and the bomb alarms in the US would have shown that the base had been destroyed. It would have looked as if Thule had been attacked with conventional weapons. The prevailing assumption was that the Soviet Union would be the aggressor in a conflict with the US, so Norad would have most likely assumed that the Evil Empire had begun its attempted takeover of the world.

With The Hobbit, director Peter Jackson moved to 48 frames per second, which apparently looks more like the digital video shot for ESPN and daytime television, than film.\n\"It reminds me of when I first saw Blu-Ray, in that it takes away that warm feeling of film,\" one source told Variety.\n\"48fps feature films will likely divide moviegoers - I expect to see stronger hate, more so than 3D,\" Peter Sciretta of Slashfilm tweeted after the screening.\nOn April 11, director Peter Jackson confirmed the use of 48 frames per second in a Facebook post. Jackson appears to be basing his argument on the fact that 3D looks better using the enhanced frame rate.\n\"The key thing to understand is that this process requires both shooting and projecting at 48 fps, rather than the usual 24 fps (films have been shot at 24 frames per second since the late 1920's),\" Jackson wrote. \"So the result looks like normal speed, but the image has hugely enhanced clarity and smoothness. Looking at 24 frames every second may seem ok - and we've all seen thousands of films like this over the last 90 years - but there is often quite a lot of blur in each frame, during fast movements, and if the camera is moving around quickly, the image can judder or 'strobe.'\"\n\"Shooting and projecting at 48 fps does a lot to get rid of these issues,\" Jackson added. \"It looks much more lifelike, and it is much easier to watch, especially in 3D. We've been watching Hobbit tests and dailies at 48 fps now for several months, and we often sit through two hours worth of footage without getting any eye strain from the 3D. It looks great, and we've actually become used to it now, to the point that other film experiences look a little primitive. I saw a new movie in the cinema on Sunday and I kept getting distracted by the juddery panning and blurring.

Gen.

They killed more than 50 Islamic State fighters, but two peshmerga charged with clearing mines from the area died when a tunnel exploded, and two more were injured, Rashid said.\nAt least one house across town near another tunnel was booby-trapped, packed with explosives. Peshmerga troops said the explosives were defused Thursday.\nAs the offensive launched by the government Monday to drive Islamic State from its last major Iraqi stronghold advances, militants are leaving a trail of rubble and deadly traps. The destruction does not bode well for Mosul, a densely populated city of 1.2 million, where residents who fled say militants have left trenches filled with burning oil and minefields.\nThe rapid advance has opened a window into how Islamic State rule gripped towns across Iraq, including the takeover of homes to build tunnels and hidden living quarters.\nThe extremist group captured Mosul and the surrounding area in 2014. Since the offensive began Monday, 5,640 people have been displaced, according to the United Nations. Humanitarian groups expect 200,000 to be displaced in the first two weeks of the offensive, with up to a million uprooted by the time it's over in a region where millions have already been displaced. Iraqi officials have urged civilians to shelter in place, but already several thousand have fled the Mosul area.\nBombs and artillery fire could be heard Thursday in Shakoli, near the front line of Bartella, an Assyrian town 12 miles east of Mosul. Nevertheless, some civilians were returning to villages retaken by Iraqi forces.\nMany returning to Shakoli were Shiite Muslims, members of the Shabaq religious minority who faced brutal treatment at the hands of Islamic State's Sunni Muslim fighters.

The lush vines twist on wooden gables, the green leaves unfurl in the warm summer sun and the sweet grapes hang heavy and ripe in the shadow of the craggy Drakenstein mountains.\nSouth Africa's wine producers are expecting a bumper crop of grapes this year, but many couldn't be gloomier. About 21 million gallons of white wine -- nearly 20 percent of last season's drinking wine harvest -- is still sitting unsold and unwanted in cellars across this region. The glut has sent prices plunging, and many fear the new crop will make matters worse.\nA ton of white wine grapes sold for $164 last year but now goes for about $123, farmers say. Nationally, producer profits fell 15 percent in 1999 from the year before. And all over the country, farmers like Mr. Malherbe are choosing to uproot their bountiful vines while wine dealers sell what they can at deep discount.\nWhy isn't the country -- or the world -- clamoring for these vintages, which are flooding markets here in bottles, boxes and bags marked at 30 percent to 40 percent off the average price of $4 or $5?\nThe problem, politely put, is that the surplus wine is not the tastiest, merchants and wine farmers say.\nTo some people this may come as a surprise. After all, what could be sweeter than a fine South African wine? The intoxicating liquid tickled Thomas Jefferson's tongue at Monticello and pleased Louis XVI's palate in Paris. And until two years ago, wine profits were booming as drinkers in Europe and America rushed to taste the fruits of this nation's new democracy.\nBut farmers were perhaps too eager to enter world markets after trade sanctions imposed on the all-white government in the 1980's ended in 1992 and 1993. Hoping to capitalize into the bargain on local demand for brandy made from white wine, many planted grapes cheaply and easily cultivated here but less popular (and often less tasty) than those preferred in Europe and America.\nForeigners cheerfully sipped mediocre brands in the heady days after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994, but they are choosier now, wine merchants say. That means the surplus wines cannot be sold abroad. Frankly, it's hard even selling them here.\nSome wineries in this region of rolling hills and green vineyards still produce high-quality wines, of course. Well-known brands sell briskly and at full price (anywhere from $8 to $12 a bottle) here and abroad.\nAnd bulk exports of higher-quality white wine, which in 1998 dipped slightly in Britain, South Africa's biggest foreign market, seem to have rebounded last year, according to SA Wine Industry Information & Systems, a trade group.\nBut there is little doubt that the foray into the free market was tougher than expected for most producers, who had dizzyingly high hopes after watching profits soar nationally, to $240 million in 1997 from $142 million in 1994, according to the trade group. Last year profits fell to $198 million.\n''So many people were excited about getting into the market after so many years that some brands and labels were put into the market which could have had more thought put into them,'' said Lynne Sherris, commercial director of Vinfruco"}

Perhaps the Cannon MGM is more familiar, because that was the name it had at the closing of the cinema in 1993.\nToday the disused building at the corner of Trinity Lane and Hollycroft Hill was most recently a bar with widescreen television showing sporting events.\nThe Danilo was Hinckley\u2019s third purpose built cinema. The Hinckley Times of the March 13 1936 told its readers that an old hosiery factory was being demolished at the corner of Trinity Lane and Hollycroft to make way for a new cinema. Mr Mortimer Dent of the Danilo Cinema Company had released the news.\nThe general contractors for the Danilo were G. E. & W. Wincott of Nuneaton. Simultaneously Wincott\u2019s were also the contractors for the Ritz cinema at Nuneaton. There seemed to be a race for which cinema would open first. The Ritz won and opened on the July 23 1937, just three days before the Hinckley cinema. The Danilo was to be opened by Sir William Edge MP (what a busy man he was opening new buildings in the Hinckley area) but unfortunately Sir William was indisposed and the duty was performed by his son Mr Knowles Edge.\nAn interesting feature of the opening was the presence of Miss Judy Kelly, the celebrated screen and stage star.\nRemarkable interest was shown in her appearance and long before the ceremony was due to commence large crowds of people had gathered outside of the cinema to watch her arrival. The crowd had greatly increased by the time of her departure.

In the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) conditions have reached crisis levels.\nOvercrowded and old inner city schools, lack of resources and support for teachers, high push-out rates, and forced racist standardized testing. Combine this with the destruction of bilingual education and the push by profit driven business interests to take over the LAUSD. The LAUSD continues to use race and class biased testing.\nRank and file teachers have organized a movement to stop standardized testing in the schools. Efforts to dismantle standardized testing have intensified in the past months. The New Raza Left has taken up this issue as part of its campaign against the injustice of the U.S. educational system.\nThe Coalition for Educational Justice has specifically confronted the school district. Known as standardized testing or Stanford 9 testing, these exams are being used to judge students ability, but in reality they do not demonstrate anything about a student's ability, or what a student has learned in his or her class during the year.\nThese exams have been designed and are composed of questions that are racist and elitist. By nature they exclude a large portion of the Chicano/a, Latino/a, African American, Indigenous and Asian population. The exams are only given in English, which means that a student who is academically advanced but still developing English as a second language will not receive a high grade. That student is then judged as though they didn't have abilities, instead of saying that the exam's grading system in not valid, because it is testing how much English someone does or does not know, instead of their academic level. The language and terms are also not at the students level, and the content of the questions reflect stereotypes offensive to cultures that are not Anglo.\nIn addition, the educational situation is getting worse because some teachers feel forced to teach to the standardized test instead of teaching material that the students actually need. Some state officials are talking about paying bonuses to teachers that reach the prescribed grade levels for the state standardized tests. The bonus system creates an environment of capitalist greed and individualism among teachers, who will then compete rather than cooperate. The state then takes away the validity of the teachers' studies and knowledge of how to best help our students.\nIt would be better if they focused on pressuring, criticizing and suggesting ways of testing which do not focus on whether or not a student has had time to learn and process academic material from each grade. By nature the Stanford 9 and other standardized tests are designed for students from minority groups and schools not to succeed, so they can then say that they are less intelligent and don't try enough.\nThe educational system has failed the oppressed nations from the beginning with the purpose of keeping the working class oppressed. This - standardized testing in the schools - is the model and the excuse for maintaining a working class that cannot question the educational system or the system in general, and then keep one or more nations oppressed.\nJoin with us to organize for a better education and struggle for a society with real justice and democracy.

Teammates Bobby Wagner, Doug Baldwin and Michael Bennett stood by as Sherman took questions for nearly 20 minutes after Seattle wrapped up the second of its minicamp practices.\nAs for his relationship with Wilson, Sherman said there is respect in the locker room for their quarterback, especially for how he played last year while dealing with serious knee and ankle injuries.\nSherman has spent his entire career in Seattle, developing from an overlooked fifth-round pick into one of the top cornerbacks in the NFL. He is due $11.4 million in guaranteed salary for the 2017 season and his current contract expires after the 2018 season.\nSherman\u2019s future hung over the Seahawks for a big chunk of the spring after general manager John Schneider first acknowledged in March that the club had trade discussions with other teams regarding the outspoken star cornerback. Those discussions came after a season during which some of Sherman\u2019s actions seemed to take precedence over his play on the field.\nSherman didn\u2019t outright apologize Wednesday for his actions last season when he erupted on the sideline at both defensive coordinator Kris Richard and offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but he did admit he may have gone too far. During the offseason, coach Pete Carroll said he thought Sherman\u2019s issues last season were self-inflicted.\nPublished: June 14, 2017, 5:54 p.m."}

The fingers are now displayed in slender, glass cases. Also on display is his tooth.

The container turned up at auction late last year, and detailed historical documents and the family's own records helped experts to identify them, according to museum officials.\nA wooden bust of Galileo tops the container in which the relics had long been kept.\nVisitors can also view what the museum says are the only surviving instruments designed and built by Galileo, including two telescopes and a lens he used to discover Jupiter's moons.\nThe Vatican condemned Galileo for contradicting church teaching, which held at the time that the Earth, not the sun, was the centre of the universe.

As the newest member of Hendrick Motorsports, Kahne was included in the group picture. But as a non-winner in the organization, he hadn't earned the right to place his name on the valued keepsake.\n\"Well, I wasn't part of that because I hadn't won a race for Hendrick Motorsports,\" Kahne said. \"They brought me up [for the group photo] because I was part of the team now.\"\nThat all changed Sunday night when Kahne earned his rightful place in the Hendrick legacy by winning the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He led six times for a total of 96 laps, including the last 44 to win by one-third of a mile over Denny Hamlin.\nKahne had to wait 21 months after signing with Hendrick to start his job. While he waited for Mark Martin to complete his contract, Kahne spent time at Richard Petty Motorsports and Red Bull Racing.\nOnce he got to Hendrick, he started with four finishes of 29th or worse in four of his first six races. Now he's rallied to post six consecutive finishes in the top eight.\nAnd more important, he feels like he's earned his spot with the team that has won a NASCAR-record 10 Sprint Cup Series championships.\n\"Well, I think the biggest thing for myself was just to figure out the cars, figure out how they drove,\" Kahne said. \"It's been a little bit different for me. We've had speed. Even the last five, six races we've been in the top 10, but not near as fast as Jimmie Johnson or a couple of those guys that have been winning the races. I just knew for myself I needed to step up. Our team is solid. Our car is solid. Mr. Hendrick gives us everything we need to win races and run up front. Tonight, we were able to put it all together.

The others are Geoff Bodine, Tim Richmond, Darrell Waltrip, Ken Schrader, Ricky Rudd, Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, Johnson, Kyle Busch, Jerry Nadeau, Joe Nemechek, Brian Vickers, Casey Mears, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Martin.\nIt took Hendrick 17 races to move from 199 wins to 200.

We still read the paper on Saturday, but a week late, when it arrived by post.\nAn Irish voice on the street was excuse enough to stop and say hello. And our book club was a place where we laughed and cried and understood one another, our link to home.\nMoving to Ennis with a young family was a different form of isolation, and in some ways, it was more difficult to meet people, as an Irish accent wasn\u2019t reason enough to talk to someone.\nAgain, a book club was a lifeline, and I\u2019ve been with my current book club in Ennis for over 20 years. For me, talking about a book with others crystallises my thoughts and it\u2019s eye-opening to hear a different response to my own.\nA couple of times a year our book club head off on outings \u2013 maybe a hill walk, trip to a city or whatever. I recall a meeting almost 15 years ago when we were planning our next outing.\nWe talked about how great it would be to have a weekend that combined reading and books with fun and chat, an event that would be stimulating and engaging. What I took to be idle dreaming turned out to be anything but.\nNext thing, a core group of our book club joined forces with two people who had organised an Ennis arts festival and were busy planning the Ennis Book Club Festival.\nIt was intended as a one-off event but was so successful that it has been held the first weekend of March since 2007.\nA steady stream of leading and upcoming authors have come to Ennis, entertaining and inspiring us.\nFor me it was a revelation to hear authors reading from their book, it brings nuances that I haven\u2019t always picked up when reading their words in my voice.\nI remember laughing while Ian McEwan read On Chesil Beach, a book I had cried my way through when reading it.\nLearning about the authors\u2019 lives, their passions and the process of writing enriches the reading of their books. And it\u2019s clear that they love to meet readers and other authors in a relaxed, friendly environment.\nMore recently, I lived in Helsinki for a few years. In the internet age, there was no difficulty in keeping abreast with friends, family and news from Ireland. But I still needed a book club and was driven to forming one.\nMy Helsinki bookclub was a mix of several nationalities and we read books from everyone\u2019s home countries. There we read some great Finnish authors, such as Sofi Oksanan.\nAn Italian member introduced us to Elena Ferrante, a book club favourite in Ireland too.\nA mediocre memoir about growing up in East Germany was vividly brought to life by a German club member whose life had closely paralleled that of the author.\nI remember her speaking in fascinating detail about her upbringing, with the time, focus and depth that a book club can permit.\nAnd it is that depth and breadth of discussion and the consequent bonding that mean most to me in book clubs.

They're clearly big on the SEC, but it'd be hard to argue that the SEC hasn't been a big story, or even the big story, in the last six seven years.

Easy answers: Yes, no, no. A touch harder is question of whether personal correspondence in a county computer is exempt. I say no. \"All records maintained in public offices or by public employees within the scope of their employment shall be presumed to be public records.\" And records further are open to the extent they demonstrate both performance \"or lack of perfomance of official functions.\" Love-note writing on company time and equipment seems evidence of latter, not to mention what those notes might reveal insofar as trips taken at county expense for, uh, software services.\nIt's another solid example of how the little guy doesn't stand a chance when government gets its back up on releasing information.

And like I said, I succeeded through all aspects (under him). Even through adversity, he was there.\"\nHardaway Jr. enjoyed the best season of his career under Hornacek, averaging 17.5 points despite missing about one-quarter of the games because of a stress reaction. The Knicks lost 53 games, however, and management cut Hornacek while proclaiming the coach didn't create enough accountability and consistency.\nGM Scott Perry added \"the timing was right for a new voice,\" but Hardaway noted that he's already heard four different such voices in the NBA \u2013 including three with the Knicks (Hornacek, Derek Fisher, Mike Woodson).\n\"Someone new in there? There's been someone new in there a lot,\" Hardaway said. \"Since I've been in the NBA I've played for four different people. I don't know how much more you can go. I understand Jeff was Phil (Jackson's) guy. And these guys come in and you know probably have something else in place or in store. So I can't answer (if a new voice would be helpful).\"\nAsked what kind of coach the Knicks need for success, Hardaway said his experience in New York makes him unqualified to answer, so he's leaving it to management.\n\"All three years I've been here have been losing records. This would be going on career-wise, my fifth coach. So I don't know,\" he said. \"If management says accountability for the guys is important for the ball club, then someone that can lead in that aspect and can show it throughout the entire season, I guess.\n\"It's all up to management, what they want to do. I'm on board with their decisions.\"\nCourtney Lee had passionately defended Hornacek during the season, challenging a reporter to explain how the coach could be responsible for injuries. The only player to echo some of management's thoughts was Michael Beasley, who said of Hornacek, \"He did some things good, he did some things bad.\n\"It's difficult for anybody (to have an uncertain job status all season). You get into a position where you're doing things not to mess up,\" Beasley added. \"You're thinking not to mess up, but at the end of the day you're still messing up.\"\nAs the Knicks look for a replacement, they've already contacted the representatives of Jerry Stackhouse, as the Daily News reported, and plan to do the same with David Fizdale, David Blatt, Mark Jackson and Jay Wright (if they haven't contacted them already).\nHornacek went 60-104 in his two seasons as a coach and was fired in the Westchester airport early Thursday morning. The 54-year-old guided an enormously flawed roster but failed to distinguish himself, which was necessary to keep his job since management had always wanted to bring in its own coach.\nRegardless of whether Mills and Perry were justified in firing Hornacek, Hardaway Jr. said he hopes they don't have to make that move again.

{"idx": "2237", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: As the American school's latest reform movement gathered momentum in the 1980's, the idea of national standards raised a noble hope, the belief that if we spotlighted the grandest peaks of knowledge in school subjects, teachers and students would strive to scale them. We are now close to seeing Congress pass legislation establishing national standards (the \"goals 2000: educate America act''), but as befalls many great ideas, the codified reality is distinguished more by pragmatic compromises than by soaring aspirations. Though essential to the art of governing, in this case political compromise has dealt a potentially mortal blow to original purpose.\nNational education goals will succeed or fail on their ability to raise American students' and parents' and teachers' appreciation for the work that they do, to motivate the key actors in schooling by placing their day-to-day labors within a larger, national mission. It is not the conservative complaint that national standards usurp local authority over education that tarnishes the latest effort. Nor is it the liberal complaint that standards supply new justifications for condemning the historically disadvantaged members of our society. Both are legitimate concerns. But, unfortunately, in accommodating these and other concerns, Goals 2000 lost its focus. What we have now looks more like 2,000 educational goals--and a missed opportunity to debate and to resolve what our schools are about, a lost opportunity to sharpen the purpose of schooling in America. Moreover, the failure of the standards to speak directly to teachers and students renders the recent debate largely irrelevant to the nation's classrooms. Schoolpeople are not the audience for this legislation; more than anything else, Goals 2000 consists of a conversation among governments--federal, state, and local. How did this happen?\nThe three sets of educational standards--content, performance, and delivery--have their own interesting political histories. Content standards define the curriculum schools are to offer; performance standards establish content-mastery levels and include assessments to measure whether students meet acceptable thresholds; and delivery standards spell out the quality of services schools must provide so that students have a reasonable opportunity to achieve the expected levels of learning. Under the legislation, a National Education Standards and Improvement Council would set voluntary national standards in the three areas, with states submitting their own standards to the council for certification that they meet or exceed the national benchmarks. The emphasis on state autonomy is designed to allay fears of an intrusive federal government.\nContent standards in core academic subjects (English, mathematics, science, history, and geography) were originally suggested by the education summit convened by President Bush and the nation's governors in 1989. After complaints from professional educators' groups representing other subject disciplines, foreign languages and the arts were added to the core group, and standards development is proceeding in civics and physical education as well. Faced with choosing between a spare or expansive core curriculum, educational leaders have opted for the latter.\nPerformance standards require tests of some kind to measure student achievement. After the public outcry following A Nation At Risk in 1983, most states instituted assessment systems to monitor student learning. For the most part, these tests are used to determine if minimum competency in basic subjects has been attained, with high school graduation or grade promotion dependent upon the results. Responding to concerns for equity, Goals 2000 would bar states for the first five years from using assessments under the new program for such high-stakes outcomes. The lesson from the states' experience with testing poses a conundrum. If tests are to be taken seriously, they must have important consequences."}

While many media organizations (including the Leader-Telegram) use confidential sources sparingly, sometimes anonymity is necessary to protect those who offer reporters information about public or private malfeasance. If reporters can easily be forced to reveal their confidential sources in court, potential whistle-blowers will think twice about giving tips to those journalists.\nKreitlow, D-Chippewa Falls, a former broadcast reporter and anchor, noted 37 states have similar shield laws.\n\u201cThere is a reason why freedom of the press is listed so high in our Bill of Rights: Because journalists do have the potential to play a critical, independent role in preserving some of our freedoms by exposing wrongdoing, which often requires anonymous sources to tell that story,\u201d said Kreitlow, who co-authored the bill with state Rep. Joe Parisi, D-Madison.\nWithout the use of confidential sources, incidents ranging from the Watergate scandal to recent Eau Claire school district shenanigans may never have been revealed. For that reason it\u2019s in the public interest to make it harder to pry into reporters\u2019 notebooks.\nAccording to Kreitlow and Parisi, Wisconsin journalists have been called on to unmask whistle-blowers in the past. A 1995 Milwaukee Magazine article about a dentist who allegedly bilked patients relied on anonymous sources. After the dentist filed a lawsuit, a circuit court told the magazine to turn over notes and the names of confidential sources.

There's good news with date functions. These are the same now as they have been for years, and the methods below work with versions of Excel from the current Office 365 for both PC and Mac, back to Excel 2007.\nYou can create an updating date cell using the Excel Today function.\nThe easiest way to add the current date in Excel is to simply type the date. For instance, typing \"2018-07-31\" in a cell is automatically detected as a date. The cell can be formatted to accept dates in that form, and you can choose the display format to which the date converts when you press Enter. For example, \"2018-07-31\" can be automatically reformatted as \"July 31, 2018.\" This can make data entry simple while creating data that's easy to read.\nHowever, a manually typed date is fixed. July 31, 2018 will always be July 31, 2018, and in many cases, that will be what you want. Entering daily sales data requires a static date, for example. There are occasions, however, when you need a date to change each time you open a spreadsheet, and sometimes it's simply helpful to have the current date visible on your worksheet. To insert a date in Excel that changes with the current date, you can use the Today function.\nThe Excel Today function is simple to use and works with virtually all versions of Excel. You can manually enter the Today function or you can choose it from the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.\nSelect the cell in which you want the current date to appear. Type \"=TODAY()\" without the quotation marks and press Enter. The current date now appears in the cell, in the default date format.\nSelect the cell in which you want the current date to appear. Click the Formulas tab, then click Date & Time on the Ribbon. Select TODAY from the drop-down menu. Click OK in the Function Arguments dialog box and the current date now appears in the cell, in the default date format.\nRight-click your cell with the current date and select Format Cells. Choose the date format you wish to use for the date. Each time you open the spreadsheet, this cell automatically updates to the current date, in the format of your choosing.\nIf you create a spreadsheet to monitor inventory, for example, you may use the same spreadsheet each time you do an inventory count, but each count needs a static date, so that you can compare August's inventory to July's, for instance.\nAdding an auto update date in Excel can save you data entry time, but you'll need to convert the automatic date to static format for saving the current inventory. This is accomplished simply, by pressing F2 to edit the cell, then F9 to recalculate the cell. Excel changes the Today function formula to the numerical value of the current date. When you press Enter, the current date still displays, but this cell no longer updates. You can now save July's inventory with a fixed date.\nThe Excel NOW function works the same as the TODAY function, however it returns both the current date and time when the spreadsheet is open. This is handy for a master spreadsheet you may use several times a day. Converted to a static time and date creates a time stamp, helpful when you"}

By the fall of 1941, regulations required Jews to wear the Star of David in public and banned friendly relations with Jews. Many parents of women married to Jews abandoned them and once-friendly neighbors and co-workers froze them out.\nHitler conceded, temporarily, to the brave women on Rosenstrasse. To protect his claim of popular consensus, Hitler sanctioned a series of exceptions for intermarried German Jews, privileging some who thus did not wear the Jewish Star, and \u201ctemporarily\u201d exempting all intermarried Jews \u2013 including those who did wear the star \u2013 from the genocide. This exemption, however, could end at any moment.\nHundreds of German intermarried Jews were drawn into the Holocaust on false charges and some in Berlin were deported and murdered at the time of the protest. Also, as soon as their non-Jewish partners agreed to divorce, the Gestapo deported their Jewish former spouses.\nSome historians have expressed skepticism regarding this story, arguing that Hitler crushed all opposition and, irrespective of these women\u2019s protest, his dictatorship never intended to deport a single Jew from Rosenstrasse, although they did wear the Jewish Star. This overlooks several key points including Hitler\u2019s characteristic improvisations, consonant with using any means at hand to reach his long-term goals without alienating too many.\nProtest made a scene that contradicted the official narrative and modeled dissent. More than once, Hitler chose to end such threats by appeasing street protesters. In Dortmund-H\u00f6ede a few weeks after the Rosenstrasse protest, a crowd of three to four hundred women successfully protested the arrest of a soldier, according to a Nazi police report. Their \u201cenergized shouts of \u2018give us our husbands back!\u2019\u201dechoed the exact words of the cry of the protesters on Rosenstrasse, suggesting that news of it had traveled.\nGestapo force could certainly prevent women from returning to their home cities, but he questioned whether it was the \u201cappropriate means.\u201d On January 24, 1944, Hitler ruled against all forms of force in the matter, prohibiting even the soft coercion of using the distribution of food rations to control unruly evacuees. Hitler did not think terror was the best means to reach all his goals, and he became more popular and caused far more destruction because he used a range of tactics, rather than always lashing out with blind force.\n"}

The digital age and the email signature eliminated the way in which you had to sign off on the footnote of a mail. A typed name, a phone number and a link to your Twitter account would definitely look so dull. Just as there are the best ways in which you can write proper mails, there are different ways of ending them in a perfect way.\nDid you just create an email signature but you didn\u2019t get any positive result? Have you been wondering about the reasons behind why your email signature doesn\u2019t look the way in which you wanted it to? Here are few reasons to take into account.\nIf you had used an email signature generator like ZippySig, you must be smiling at the thought that you\u2019ve used software for managing your email signatures. In case your email signatures are not managed centrally, it depends on the individual to write down and format the email signature is a good and profitable manner. The logo should be inserted in a proper manner and the contact details should be accurate.\nAll mail signatures have their own editor to design and maintain email signatures.

Well, though it\u2019s true that you can create it yourself, are you an email signature specialist?

Make your own but don\u2019t copy someone else\u2019s signature.\nThis is yet another blunder to avoid. When you don\u2019t have knowledge on this, you may design the signature in Word and copy it on Outlook\u2019s signature editor. You may think everything is fine but when you design it in Word, you limit all designing possibilities.\nThere are hundreds of conversations where you learn that the entire IT department prefers eliminating all kinds of email signatures from their mails. Little do they know that the email signature is a vital marketing tool and hence it should be used accordingly.\nYour email signature format shouldn\u2019t only comprise of your name and contact details. This is indeed a feasible opportunity to share marketing messages, contact details and your latest blog post or tweets.\nJust as what you do with the marketing campaigns, ask yourself who you\u2019re targeting when you create your email signatures. If there are CTAs added to the signature, what kind of action do you want the recipients to take? How are you going to measure the results? Should there be a landing page?\nMail deliverability rates for email mass marketing is declining. The most effective route to take in order to reach out to the inbox of your recipients is through peer-to-peer mails or the mails which we send daily.\nThis is something that the designers should keep in mind.

Currently drawing flak from the BJP on charges of poor governance, corruption and deterioration law and order, apart from \u2018mafia-rule\u2019, the saffron party\u2019s rout in the national capital has given Virbhadra a reason to rejoice.\nCM Virbhadra blamed the BJP for its \u2018arrogance\u2019 and accused its state leadership of making attempts to destabilise his government instead of playing the role of a \u2018constructive opposition\u2019.\nYet, few congress leaders say Delhi results are a signal for the party in Himachal Pradesh to deliver on its promises and provide a corruption-free government. But it\u2019s now the BJP which faces high stakes as it has been hoping to return to power when Himachal goes to the polls in 2017.\nTwo-time Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, who had led the BJP in the 2012 polls against a beleaguered congress veteran (Virbhadra), is already facing the party\u2019s apathy. During the past two years, he had been a target of the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau that had filed a series of cases against him and his son Anurag Thakur.\nDhumal, during Lok Sabha polls, had predicted that Virbhadra government will not last for more than two months after Narendra Modi becomes prime minister. Contrary to his public claims, Virbhadra completed two years in power in December 2014 and is still going strong. Voices of dissent against CM Virbhadra also remains at a low-pitch, and Modi\u2019s return has not made any difference.\nIt\u2019s rather Dhumal who has not got the central leadership\u2019s backing to fight his congress rival despite Modi being his political mentor in 1998, when he ( Dhumal) headed a BJP coalition government with Sukh Ram\u2019s backing. The rise of J P Nadda, a new national leader (now union health minister) from Himachal Pradesh in two years time, seems to have eclipsed Dhumal\u2019s chances. Till he gets a clear signal from Delhi to lead the party in 2017, Dhumal will have to bide time.\nYet, before this, AAP\u2019s state convenor and former BJP MP Dr Rajan Sushant has also set his eye to play a spoilsport for the BJP. \u201cHimachal will see a replay of Delhi in 2017. By next few months, the AAP will have its own feet to stand. My focus is to create a strong party structure and thereafter start a mass movement on basic (ground) issues,\u201d he told the Indian Express.\nMeanwhile veteran BJP leader Shanta Kumar has called for a deep self-intros"}

The company is now building the first toll overpass in the Moscow region, at Vostraikovsky, on the Paveletsky rail line, in the Domodedovo district. This crossing is now closed up to 18 hours a day due to rail traffic, Sopryakov said.\nBy the end of this year, RPD plans to obtain all necessary permits, and the overpass should be completed by fall 2014.\nThe company estimates the cost of the overpass at no less than 500 million rubles, and the project will have a payback period of between 10 and 15 years. Cars will pay 15 rubles to cross, while other vehicles will pay 30 rubles. Public transportation and emergency vehicles will cross for free.\nAfter 20 years, RPD will hand the overpass over to the regional or local government.\nGazprombank is a potential investor in toll overpasses, a source in the regional administration told Vedomosti. \u201cThis is low-margin business but important for the region, and the source of the return on investment is clear,\u201d Gazprombank executive vice president Alexei Chichkanov said.\nAccording to existing law, construction of a toll overpass requires that a free alternative be within 5 kilometers of the paid crossing. There is a free crossing about 3 to 4 kilometers from Vostraikovsky, Sopryakov said.\nThe Moscow region government plans to finance the construction of 17 railway overpasses in the region by 2020, at a cost of 70 billion rubles, acting Governor Andrei Vorobyov said recently.\nThe first ones will be in Pavlovsky Possad, Dologoprudny, Kotelniky and Novy Stupino.\nThese are the most problematic, as drivers wait an average of three hours during rush hour to cross. There are about 100 railroad crossings in the Moscow region.\nBut providing overpasses for all these crossings using budget funds is not possible, so the governor issued an order to attract private investors."}

In the immediate aftermath, the prime minister withdrew the moratorium on death penalty and started hanging those on death row.\nA more \u2018considered\u2019 National Action Plan hinged on the setting up of military courts. But that was easier said than done. It required an amendment in the Army Act which, in turn, required a constitutional amendment.

We are co-hosting a special event that I believe really matters- the \u201cReinvent Business\u201d hackathon that will be held in San Francisco on June 9-10. In focusing on how we urgently need to reinvent business and how we can change corporate behavior from within, the article captures many of the themes that I cover in The HOW Column. The deadline for software developers, designers, gamers, filmmakers and business leaders to submit their applications to build innovative products and services for the \u201cReinvent Business\u201d hackathon is on May 25 (participate at www.reinventbusinesshackathon.com).\nHow can the use of technology enable companies and the people within them to make better decisions and have a more positive impact on our world? Can creative minds help us rethink how business operates? Can the right group of people collaborate to reexamine and restore the social contract between business and society?\nAs members of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Agenda Council on Values in Decision-Making, we are hosting a hackathon \u2013 a collaborative, rapid ideation and programming workshop \u2013 in San Francisco on June 9-10, jointly produced by frog and LRN, and in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, Net Impact, Silicon Valley Bank, and Fast Company. The \u201cReinvent Business\u201d hackathon will bring together software developers, designers, gamers, film makers, writers, leaders in business and academia, and other problem solvers to imagine, design, and build a more human and truly social enterprise. The goal is both simple and bold: to develop concepts and prototypes for products, services, and tools that have the potential to transform business from within.\nThis is one of many initiatives that the Values Council has been working on as part of an ambitious agenda to help organizations translate human values into practices and behaviors that strengthen our institutions and positively impact the state of the world. The Values Council was formed by the World Economic Forum in response to the current economic crisis \u2013 a crisis of values \u2013 to realign our collective mindset and develop practical approaches for a more moral economy. New challenges call for new approaches, and we hope that with this hackathon as the starting point, the Council can engage the tech and creative communities in an ongoing constructive dialogue on how technology, and especially social technology, can change corporate behavior. This need for behavior change, for \u201creinventing business,\u201d is an urgent one.\nWhile most companies will subscribe to that point of view, the disconnection between business and society (and, as studies show, between management and employees) is indisputable.

{"idx": "2290", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: JERUSALEM \u2014 The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism\u2019s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order.\nBut after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December\u2019s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site. To prevent the women from defying a Supreme Court ruling that bars them from wearing ritual garments at the wall, they were blocked by police officers from bringing them in.\nAfter years of legislative and legal fights, the movement for equal access for people to pray as they wish at the site has become a rallying cause for liberal Jews in the United States and around the world, though it has long struggled to gain traction here in Israel, where the ultra-Orthodox retain great sway over public life.\nThis has deepened a divide between the Jewish state and the Jewish diaspora, in which some leaders have become increasingly vocal in criticizing Israel\u2019s policies on settlements in the Palestinian territories; laws and proposals that are seen as antidemocratic or discriminatory against Arab citizens; the treatment of women; and the ultra-Orthodox control over conversion and marriage.\n\u201cWhen my kids start expressing frustration with Israel as a society because what they hear and see from a distance is not welcoming to them in their religious practice \u2014 that\u2019s not good for the Jewish people, let alone for the state of Israel,\u201d said Rabbi Steven C. Wernick, the director of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.\nWhile more than 60 percent of Jews in the United States identify with the Reform or Conservative movements, where women and men have equal standing in prayer and many feminists have adopted ritual garments, in Israel it is one in 10. Instead, about half call themselves secular, and experts say that most of those consider Orthodoxy as the true Judaism, feel alienated from holy sites like the Western Wall, and view a woman in a prayer shawl as an alien import from abroad.\nThe increased agitation around the wall is part of a broader clash over Judaism and gender that has roiled Israel in recent months. Women have won lawsuits against segregation on buses and sidewalks imposed in religious neighborhoods. But a bus line recently stopped accepting advertisements with images of people after religious vandals routinely blacked out women\u2019s faces in the name of modesty.\nIn January, speakers at a conference on health and Jewish law canceled their appearances because women were barred from the podium \u2014 a demand of the most Orthodox \u2014 while the chief rabbi of the air force quit after religious soldiers were not excused from events where women sang.\nThese controversies concern the imposition of Orthodox doctrine in secular spheres. More complicated are questions of how Judaism itself should be practiced. This spring, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must pay the salary of a Reform rabbi along with hundreds of Orthodox ones. A small group of Jerusalem restaurants has been seeking an alternative kosher certification system to the one run by the government\u2019s rabbinical council.\nWomen of the Wall began in December 1988, when tourists attending a feminist conference decided to take a Torah scroll they had brought from the United States to a prayer service at the Western Wall, a remnant of the retaining wall that surrounded the ancient Temple Mount.

Serrano, New York Democrat, expressed concern about whether the Justice Department's global efforts to confront terrorists, including the rounding up of suspected illegal immigrants in this country, threatened civil liberties.\n\"I have the highest regard for the Justice Department and all the important work it does. The response to the attacks of September 11 was and is deeply appreciated by New Yorkers, especially this one,\" Mr. Serrano said.\n\"On the other hand, some of the policies the department has proposed to combat terrorism are deeply troubling, and I fear some officials are so intent on fighting against terror that they forget what we are fighting for,\" he said.\nMr. Serrano said he and others feared that during times of crisis, some steps could be taken by the department to cause \"long-term harm to the values we stand for,\" adding that other crises had led to civil rights abuses in the past, including the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\"I don't like people reading my e-mails or listening to my phone calls. The books I buy are my own business. I don't like people poking around in my personal life, for my personal life is not a threat to my country,\" he said. \"And my constituents feel the same.\"\nMr. Serrano acknowledged a \"very delicate balance\" between protecting the United States from terrorists, finding them, bringing them to justice, preventing further acts of terrorism and preserving civil liberties, and that maintaining that balance was \"extremely difficult.\"\n\"But we must never tip the balance away from the rights and freedoms that make us Americans and make the United States a beacon to the world,\" he said. \"After all, our struggle is about freedom. \u2026 It's about our freedom, it's about other people's freedoms.\n\"If we forget who we are and behave badly here or in other places, then they won, the September 11 crowd would have won,\" he said.\nMr. Ashcroft described the safeguarding of civil liberties as \"the single most important task we have.\"\n\"At the beginning of this republic, when there were but four Cabinet agencies, there was the Department of State to deal with foreign powers; a Department of War to wage war and defense; a Department of the Treasury to look after financial matters; and it is no shock to learn that the Attorney General's Office became the office which developed a focus on protecting and nourishing an environment of freedom,\" he said.\n\"That's why we have a special sensitivity to it. And we always need to be reminded and welcome reminding that the pursuit of civil liberties is the responsibility of the Justice Department,\" he said. \"And we will continue to make that our highest priority.\""}

But his estranged wife, Monserrate Shirley, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the thermostat was replaced recently, correcting a problem heating the home. Shirley, who lived in the house but wasn't there during the explosion, said she had smelled a strange odor outside before the blast, but didn't know if it was natural gas.\nBut experts said homeowners shouldn't be worried that their furnaces are about to explode.\nJohn Erickson, vice president of the American Public Gas Association, said it would take a far more serious malfunction than just a pilot light going out. And forensic mechanical engineer Richard Schreiber, with Intertek AIM in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it's usually immediately evident whether a blast was caused by natural gas.\n\"If the investigators don't find a crater, that pretty much means it was something other than a solid phase explosion,\" he said, meaning it's likely to be a gas explosion. But he also said such investigations can still take time.\nMore than a dozen home explosions linked to natural gas have occurred in the last two years. Many involved a single home, though more devastating blasts tied to pipelines have been reported, including a 2011 explosion in Allentown, Pa., that killed five people and a blast in 2010 in San Bruno, Calif., that killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes. A gas leak in a Colorado home last month sparked an explosion that sent five people to a hospital and damaged several homes.\nErickson also said a temperature sensor on furnaces is supposed to prevent a gas valve from opening if the pilot light is out. But if that device were to malfunction \u2013 or if a gas pipe in the house were to break \u2013 it could allow a significant gas buildup and cause a big explosion, he said.\nSchreiber added that gas explosions create an intense wave of heat that can ignite surrounding homes.\nThe NTSB said the natural gas lines inside the house would be under the oversight of the utility or the state. Citizens Energy spokeswoman Sarah Holsapple said the utility had found no leaks in its underground facilities in the neighborhood; the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission had no comment Tuesday.\n\"I have been through car accidents, I've been through motorcycle accidents, I've been through tornadoes.

If you take a few seconds to click through its settings, PestPatrol provides decent spyware removal.\nBy default, the program is set to run a Standard Scan, which analyzes cookies, the Microsoft Windows Registry, memory, and the disk locations where CA feels pests are most likely to hide. When running in this mode, PestPatrol averaged roughly 50 percent accuracy in spotting malware on our test system. Doing a Custom Scan and selecting all drives upped its ability to find and stop pests on our \"torture system\" to a more acceptable level.\nBecause spyware apps don't always have descriptive names, PestPatrol lets you click on a discovered pest and go to the company's wonderfully descriptive online Pest Encyclopedia. Even newbies can use the information to decide whether a program is acceptable adware or something darker\u0097or just unwelcome.\nThe product's Active Protection seemed to be anything but active during the infection phase of our real-time prevention testing.

Three female executives abruptly left AJAM earlier this year, and the newsroom has been beset by poor morale.\nOne of those executives, former senior vice president of outreach Marcy McGinnis, said that she resigned to escape the \"culture of fear\" at AJAM.

{"idx": "2315", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Wireless networking using the 802.11 standard, also known by its trade name, Wi-Fi, has become common in the home and has a significant and growing role in corporate settings. But the existing standard, 802.11g, was ratified in 2003 and is increasingly seen as inadequate as applications become more complex and require more bandwidth.\nFor instance, streaming video -- whether it's a feature-length movie at home or videoconferencing at work -- is a dicey proposition with 802.11g. So-called \"g\" products have a theoretical maximum throughput speed of 54Mbit/sec. but real-world speeds of half that or even slower, which isn't quite enough for video.\nTo the rescue, eventually, will be 802.11n, which promises significantly higher speed and range. Here's the lowdown of what to expect with 802.11n and when to expect it.\nHow is 802.11n different than current generations of Wi-Fi?\nThe 802.11n standard uses some new technology and tweaks existing technologies to give Wi-Fi more speed and range. The most notable new technology is called multiple input, multiple output (MIMO). MIMO uses several antennas to move multiple data streams from one place to another. Instead of sending and receiving a single stream of data, MIMO can simultaneously transmit three streams of data and receive two. This allows more data to be transmitted in the same period of time. This technique can also increase range, or the distance over which data can be transmitted.\nA second technology being incorporated into 802.11n is channel bonding, which can use two separate nonoverlapping channels at the same time to transmit data. This technique also increases the amount of data that can be transmitted. A third technology in 802.11n is called payload optimization or packet aggregation, which, in simple terms, means more data can be stuffed into each transmitted packet.\nSo, what are the benefits of 802.11n?\nUsers will notice two things about this new and improved wireless technology: significantly greater speed and range. Both Intel Corp., which has a vested interested in 802.11n because it manufactures wireless chip sets, and independent reviews indicate that the claims of greater speed and range for 802.11n are true.\nSpecifically, 802.11g products, which have a theoretical maximum throughput speed of 54Mbit/sec., typically provide real-world speeds of 22Mbit/sec. to 24Mbit/sec. In contrast, Intel says it's seeing real-world speeds of 100Mbit/sec. to 140Mbit/sec. for 802.11n equipment. Those results were confirmed in a recent Computerworld roundup review of several Wi-Fi products based on Draft 2 of the 802.11n standard.\nRange is harder to quantify because it's affected by many variables, such as barriers that could block the signal. However, Intel reports that 802.11n equipment typically delivers more than twice the range of 802.11g equipment, at any given throughput speed. Those results were confirmed anecdotally in the recent Computerworld review.\n\"At the very end of an open field with no interference, where you could get 1Mbit/sec. with \"g\" equipment, you'll net 1"}

Klein writes it more as a curiosity, or as an indictment of the \u201cbitter clingers\u201d out there who can\u2019t get with the inevitable program.\nSailer, chuckling at Klein\u2019s arrogance, notes how ridiculous it all is. How obvious that if you make manifest your intention to replace the current majority with a new one, that the current majority might find your plan objectionable? He recalls that back after the bare-minimum Republican electoral win in 2000 he suggested the Republican Party merely needed to push its share of the white vote from 54 to 57 percent in the country in order to retake a solid majority of American voters (this idea was opposed by the GOP establishment and then-president George W. Bush\u2019s guru Karl Rove, who believed the key to the party\u2019s success could be found in co-opting the Hispanic vote). Fast forward 16 years, and Donald Trump fulfilled Sailer\u2019s prophecy by winning 58 percent of the white vote, a number which might very well be a low mark for future elections, on the way to the White House. Trump didn\u2019t win the popular vote, you might argue, but he is in fact the president.\nThat victory is not evidence of some Republican strategy to radicalize race in America, mind you"}

Instead, new research suggests that fitness, not physical activity alone, plays a protective role in guarding the body against risk factors for heart disease and other conditions.\nEven when seniors sit for 12-13 hours per day, if they are fit, their cardiovascular risk factors are reduced.\nLiving a sedentary lifestyle - such as sitting for prolonged periods - has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Physical inactivity raises the risk of developing high blood pressure and coronary heart disease and has been found to increase the risk of certain cancers.\nStudies have linked excessive sitting to being overweight and obese, type 2 diabetes, and early death. Lack of physical activity can also lead to feelings of anxiety and depression.\nSitting for long periods has been suggested to slow the metabolism, which affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar, blood pressure, and break down body fat.\nRegular physical activity is essential for healthy aging, and adults aged 65 years and over gain substantial health benefits from regular exercise. Physical activity guidelines recommend older adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, such as brisk walking, and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week to work all major muscle groups.\nAmong individuals who meet physical activity recommendations, the risk of cardiovascular disease with high sedentary time remains. However, high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with reduced levels of cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia.\nResearchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) aimed to determine whether meeting physical activity guidelines or having high age-specific cardiorespiratory fitness would reduce the adverse effect of prolonged sitting on cardiovascular risk factors for seniors.\nCardiorespiratory fitness is the ability of the heart and lungs to provide the working muscles with oxygenated blood for a prolonged period and determine the level of fitness, which goes downhill with age. Cardiorespiratory fitness is an important health indicator that can predict cardiovascular disease mortality and can be improved by increasing both the intensity and amount of exercise.\nWhile the average American adult sits for between 9-11 hours a day, the NTNU research found that the participants who were in the least sedentary third of the study still spent between 12-13 hours per day in sedentary behavior. The most sedentary of all participants were sedentary for up to 15 hours a day.\nThe NTNU study was part of a randomized controlled clinical trial with the primary objective of investigating the effect of exercise training on morbidity and mortality in the older adult population.\nThe team conducted a cross-sectional study of 495 women and 379 men from Norway aged between 70-77 years. Sedentary time and physical activity were assessed by accelerometers, while cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) - the measurement of the volume of oxygen that the body can utilize during physical exertion.\nResearchers compared different levels of activity with fitness levels and cardiovascular risk factor clusters. A cardiovascular risk factor cluster was defined as the presence of three to five risk factors for heart disease.\nThese risk factors included: elevated waist circumference, elevated blood triglycerides or reduced \"good"}

Pi\u00ebch, the company's chairman and an heir to the Porsche fortune, agreed to step down next year in return for two Porsche executives gaining seats on the board.\nMr. Pi\u00ebch, a powerful figure who was once Volkswagen's chief executive, has been accused by shareholders and other board members of a conflict of interest since Porsche, the sports car maker controlled by his family, acquired 18.5 percent of Volkswagen's shares last fall.\nPorsche asserted that its investment entitled it to two seats on the Volkswagen board. Other directors objected, citing Mr. Pi\u00ebch's dual interests and saying that Porsche was trying to amass too much influence over Volkswagen, a company more than 10 times its size and Germany's largest carmaker.\nThe dispute laid bare the web of interlocking ties among German companies, at times made all the closer by family holdings. It also raised troubling questions about corporate governance at Volkswagen, a far-flung automotive empire with public and private shareholders that has been rocked by a bribery and corruption scandal.\nUnder an agreement reached between Porsche and Volkswagen's other major shareholder, the state of Lower Saxony, Porsche's chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, will join the board immediately, and its chief financial officer, Holger P. H\u00e4rter, will be nominated for a seat in May.\nMr. Pi\u00ebch, 68, will not stand for reelection when his contract expires in 2007, according to a spokesman for Porsche, Michael Baumann. Mr. Pi\u00ebch's successor will not come from Porsche or from Lower Saxony, Mr. Baumann said; those exclusions are intended to make the chairman a more neutral figure.\nInvestors welcomed the agreement, though some still expressed concerns, especially since the Porsche executives would probably be under the sway of Mr. Pi\u00ebch.\n\"I personally felt that one representative would have been adequate,\" said William H. Browne, a managing director at Tweedy, Browne, an investment firm based in New York that manages Volkswagen shares and had campaigned to block the election of the Porsche executives.\nStill, Mr. Browne said, the departure of Mr. Pi\u00ebch would be helpful. \"Mr. Pi\u00ebch had a conflict,\" he said. \"To have him in there, with two other Porsche executives, would have tipped the scales.\"\nMr. Pi\u00ebch, who sealed the agreement in a meeting with Mr. Wiedeking and the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Christian Wulff, did not issue a statement and could not be reached for comment.\nWhen Porsche acquired the stake in Volkswagen in September, it said it was trying to protect the independence of one of its main partners. Volkswagen assembles much of Porsche's Cayenne sport utility vehicle, and the two companies are collaborating on hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles.\nVolkswagen has struggled in recent years, and it was viewed as a possible takeover target because a German law that shields it from unwanted suitors is in danger of being struck down in a European court.\nBut the investment, experts say, was as much about history as economics.

The goal was to cut down on their environmental footprint.\nAccording to the dictionary, an ort is \u201ca morsel left at a meal.\u201d The kids measured their orts by scraping their plates into bins lined up at the back of the cafeteria. There were bins designated for food waste, recycling, silverware and plates. The children then weighed the bin of food waste and graphed it on a large chart in the cafeteria. They used their math skills to add the day\u2019s amount to the overall total, and to see how they were tracking against other classes and compared with past days and weeks.\nThis program taught my kids what was recyclable and made them think before they helped themselves to food that they might not eat.\nThey have asked to undertake a similar program at home with their younger sister. As you can imagine, I am not eager to line up bins of waste in my kitchen or to invest in a large scale, but the idea alone has certainly resulted in us observing how much waste we produce. The boys have also been commenting on how many garbage bags we take to the trash each week. I like to think they care because they are becoming environmentally conscious, but my guess is it\u2019s actually because they are tired of carrying the bags.\nAccording the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American disposes of almost 4 1 / 2 pounds of trash a day. Of that amount, 20 percent to 30 percent is food scraps and yard debris that can be composted to help the earth instead of hurt it. As my boys calculated, if 10 percent of the population cut down on landfill waste by this amount, there would be a lot less pollution. Sophisticated math, boys.\nSo we have decided to start composting again; we had stopped a few years ago when we moved and ditched our old compost tumbler. I thought perhaps the technology had changed during this period. Surprisingly, it really hasn\u2019t; there are a few tried-and-true ways to compost, even for those of us living in the city.\nWhen food scraps go into a landfill, they create methane gas that enters our environment and warms the planet. The water in food scraps also combines with other landfill garbage to create toxic sludge that then seeps into our water system and earth. If we kept food scraps out of landfills, not only would we reduce the size of our landfills, but we\u2019d also produce less methane and toxic sludge.\nCompost also benefits the environment because it reduces the need for chemical fertilizer; compost soil is naturally richer in nutrients and has a finer texture for growing. Compost requires less water as it more effectively holds onto moisture. Growing vegetables in compost tends to produce more nutrient-rich vegetables.\nMix equal parts of green nitrogen-rich materials (food scraps, flowers, plants) with brown carbon-rich materials (dry leaves, shredded paper, dryer lint, straw) and add water. Turn and mix regularly.\n\u00b7 Backyard pile: This option is best for individuals with a large outdoor space in a less urban environment. Find a dry, shady spot near a water source.

The beautiful, photogenic Trudeaus went to see the Taj Mahal in Agra, where they were welcomed not by the provincial chief minister, not even a junior minister, but by district officials. Still, the Trudeaus managed to make memorable visuals at India's famous mausoleum of love. Modi often likes to take visiting dignitaries to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, his home state. Many good visuals have been produced in Gujarat with Modi showing world leaders around Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram or just taking them around the city.

All four of Trudeau's Indian-origin ministers are Sikh, and Trudeau has publicly boasted how he has more Sikh ministers than Modi. Amarinder Singh, chief minister of the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab and himself a Sikh, has publicly accused Trudeau's ministers of having sympathies with Canadian Sikh extremists who would like to see Indian Punjab separated from India into the state of Khalistan. Last year, Singh had refused to meet Trudeau's defense minister, Harjit Singh Sajjan. All four Sikh ministers have recently visited India, and New Delhi would have liked it if Trudeau didn't bring them along again. But for Trudeau, this trip is all about the Sikh vote in Canada.\nAs the Khalistan issue simmers between India and Canada, New Delhi wants Trudeau to publicly affirm Canada's commitment to \"the unity and integrity of India.\" Speaking on Monday, Trudeau said Canada supported \"one united India.\" At the same time, Trudeau is going around making noises about India's diversity and pluralism, which will be read by Sikhs back home as having given India the message.\nCanada's position is that it cannot curtail the right to freedom of speech and expression of its Sikh citizens, but New Delhi wants Trudeau to publicly distance himself from Sikh separatists. As the two sides were unable to resolve the tension by the time Trudeau landed in New Delhi, the aim of Modi's snub is to mount pressure on the Canadians. Modi will meet Trudeau only toward the end of his week-long India visit.

Excellent push e-mail.\nSmall keys, small type on screen, destroys attachment formatting, few games or downloadable applications.\nA new approach for BlackBerry. The first BlackBerry device to work equally well for e-mail, IM, Web browsing, and as a phone.\nThe new BlackBerry 7100t is nothing like any BlackBerry before it. It's the first to look, work, and feel like an actual phone. And the 7100t's impressive e-mail compatibility and bargain price put it over the top as our Editors' Choice for smart phones with keyboards in this story and in our First Looks review of October 5.\nAt 4.3 ounces, the 7100t fits comfortably in your hand. It has a high-quality speaker phone and supports Bluetooth wireless headsets. Because it's a quad-band GSM phone, you can use it overseas. And the 2.1-inch, 240-by-260 color display is sharp and bright.\nRIM ditched the usual full keyboard for a strange, 20-key hybrid keypad that relies heavily on predictive text. Most keys have two letters and a number on them, but the keys are in the familiar QWERTY layout. RIM's SureType predictive text system is far better than its competitors'; after 15 minutes, we were typing with ease.\nThe 7100t includes a full HTML Web browser; AIM, ICQ, and Yahoo! instant messaging; and very easy-to-use e-mail and PIM applications. It can access almost any personal or corporate e-mail, and the included desktop software syncs PIM data with a wide range of apps quickly and easily. It even plays downloadable Java games.\nOur only criticism of the 7100t is that it lacks some more advanced business and multimedia features. For example, it strips the formatting out of e-mails and attachments, doesn't play MP3s or videos, and can't be used as a modem for your laptop.\nThe 7100t is a new device for a new generation of users, many of whom will be lured by its low price. If you're looking for a powerful, portable, personal e-mail phone, this smart phone is no doubt an excellent buy.\nBottom Line: A new approach for BlackBerry.

In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded yearly expeditions that emptied entire areas of their Native American presence. But this is not only a historical phenomenon: In the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have attempted for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susiya.\nThe village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to enable settlers to move in and replace the former inhabitants. The Palestinian population then moved to underground caves and shacks 500 meters from the original location. In the 1990s, and again in 2001, there were more attempts to remove the villagers and annex their lands to the nearby settlement. The residents have submitted a master plan that would enable recognition of Susiya, but they have only received demolition orders.\nOn May 5, Israel\u2019s high court refused to issue an interim order to the army to freeze fresh plans to entirely destroy the village and expel all of its inhabitants. All this while the neighboring illegal Israeli settlement, called Susya, receives water and electricity, is connected to the road system and its residents can vote.\nA recently leaked army document reveals that the authorities are well aware of the village\u2019s true legal status, but so far they have refused to legally recognize its inhabitants\u2019 rights to remain in their homes and enjoy the same protections as Jewish Israelis. All this is a microcosm of the structural discrimination and dispossession Palestinians have suffered for decades. As an Israeli Jew, I find this inequality deeply shameful.\nIn late July, I was among several hundred Israelis and internationals joining local Palestinians in a large protest against this unjust move. Susiya is only 1.5 hours away from Tel Aviv, but it\u2019s rare for people to come to this remote area and see the reality for themselves. We marched peacefully for several hours, despite the extreme heat, and heard very touching requests from residents and their supporters to help protect them in case the army renews its attempts to evict them. The media tend not to cover protests that do not include violence, thereby ignoring the hundreds who showed up and demanded that the village be spared.\nInitially, the army planned to demolish Susiya before a high court hearing scheduled for Aug. 3. Due to growing public pressure, this date has now been postponed. But more pressure is necessary to remove the threat entirely.\nBut this is not enough: We hope Secretary of State John Kerry can send a clear message to the Israeli government that the U.S. opposes present-day ethnic cleansing. Continuous international attention of the sort pushed by Feinstein and Rep. Anna Eshoo can help prevent this injustice, and set an important precedent against driving indigenous residents out of their homes.\nTom Pessah is an Israeli activist and sociologist.

Burton is the founder of Georgia-based charity Wish for WASH, an organisation that wants to tackle taboos surrounding sanitation.\n\"We don't recognise toilets and all they do for us,\" she says. \u201cBut because of a lack of sanitation, 2,000 children die every day\u201d. Through innovative and human-centred design, Wish for WASH hopes to change this prognosis.\nIn 2011, whilst studying product design at Georgia Technology Institute, Burton attended a talk by Susan Davies, the director of Improve International, that changed her career path completely. Davies explained that that women and girls are disproportionately affected by a lack of sanitation and that taboos surrounding menstruation mean that many girls do not attend school whilst on their period due to a lack of toilet facilities. \"When I learned of the enormity of this problem, I immediately called my parents,\u201d says Burton, who was amongst the speakers at WIRED Next Generation 2017. \u201cI said, 'I'm going to design toilets'.\"\nThree years later, Burton and her peers were asked to come up with a workable design solution to mitigate some of the negative effects of this sanitation challenge. They came up with the SafiChoo toilet: an inexpensive toilet frame that could be easily picked up and taken to any destination. The toilet had a tray system to provide a safe and clean method of disposal. The design was entered into the InVenture Prize competition, the largest undergraduate design competition in the United States and won, making the Burton and her colleagues the first all-female team to win the title and $25,000 (\u00a318,000) in funding. The team put the money towards their first pilot trip to test the toilets in northern Kenya, in a refugee camp where sanitation was particularly poor.\n\u201cWe recruited some of our friends and professors to start manufacturing crude designs that we could shift to Kenya,\u201d says Burton. Once people started using the toilet, the team realised they needed to make a lot of changes. The seat would no longer be made from ceramic but swapped for plastic, making shipping cheaper and more efficient. The in-tray was deemed too complicated and replaced with a bucket-based system for disposal. \u201cWe tested ten of these toilets for an entire summer,\u201d she says.\nIn 2015, Burton led an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that raised $25,000 to support another pilot project in Zambia. After securing the funding, the improved SafiChoo was manufactured, shipped, installed and monitored. The trial received particularly positive feedback from the community in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. Now, they are hoping to scale it to the entire city.\nAlthough still in the pilot phase, Burton is hopeful for the scalability of the SafiChoo design. Once she can secure enough funding, the plan is to conduct market-viability tests to produce enough data to prove the positive impact the toilets can have on local communities. In the meantime, the team will keep working to reduce the taboo surrounding sanitation, expanding the education arm of Wish for WASH.\n\"It is challenging to be operating in a space that I was not formally trained in, designers do not usually learn about working in the social sector or in traditional education programs,\" Burton explains. But, the fight for sanitation goes on. \"Toilets are more than just about toilets, they are about"}

The relentless rains flooded thousands of homes and businesses and cost more than $700 million in damages.\nIt was both the wettest January and the wettest winter ever measured at the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, which has kept daily precipitation records since 1767.\nClimate change could mean England is in for more such extreme rainfall events because of increasing moisture in the atmosphere and changes in atmospheric weather patterns, a new study detailed online Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change finds.\nThe study is the first to take so-called event attribution a step further to investigate how warming has increased the risks of flooding impacts, finding that it has likely put more properties at risk and raised the costs of such an event.\nWhen combined with previous studies, this new effort provides further evidence that winter weather and its significant impacts in the UK \"had a link to human-induced climate change,\" said study co-author Peter Stott, who leads the Climate Monitoring and Attribution team at the UK Met Office.\nWhile no one storm that blew over the UK that winter was particularly extreme on its own, the repeated bouts of rain overwhelmed the ability of streams and the ground to absorb all that water. The hardest hit areas in southern England saw 14.5 inches of rain over just December and January, and that January was the wettest in the area since 1910 by a \"very wide margin,\" according to the Met Office.\nOne reason the rains kept coming was a larger pattern in place in the atmosphere, with the jet stream in an unusual position that kept guiding storms over the increasingly soggy region.\nStudies conducted relatively quickly after the event found that climate change had made such extreme rainfall more likely, but the new study aimed to examine any link in more detail.\nThe research team, which included scientists involved with Climate Central's World Weather Attribution project, used a now-routine method that involves running multiple iterations of several climate models. The models are used to compare the odds of such an event happening in a world with human-caused warming to one without it.\nThe modeling showed that such an event was about 40% more likely in a world with warming, both because of the increased moisture in a warmer atmosphere \u2014 a key tenet of climate change \u2014 and because that particular jet stream pattern was more likely to occur and corresponded to higher rainfalls in southern England.\nThe researchers then used statistical methods to break down the relative contributions of the two influences on the increased odds. They found that while the increased moisture content was the primary factor in the extreme rainfall, accounting for about two-thirds of the added risk, the atmospheric pattern still played a noticeable role, filling out the remaining one-third.\nStott cautioned, though, that this was only one study and that more will be needed to pin down that breakdown. \"This is not yet the definitive answer,\" he said.\nThe team took their effort a step further to see how increased rainfall associated with warming would affect river flow along the Thames and then how many more properties would be put at risk and how much more that would cost. Theirs is the first attribution study to extend an analysis to such concrete impacts, which is what insurance companies, governments and the public is most concerned about.\n\"This is something we've always wanted to do with an attribution study,\" said study co-"}

Historian and author Charles Freeman argued that the famous linen cloth was probably used in a 14th-century Easter re-enactment of the Resurrection known as the Quem Queritis, \u201cWhom do you seek?\u201d The dating ties in with the 1988 radio-carbon findings, although these have been disputed by believers in the ancient and miraculous origins of the shroud.\nOld descriptions and pictures of the shroud show that the image of Christ has not always looked as faint as it does today, Mr Freeman says in the article. \u201cAstonishingly, few researchers appear to have grasped that the shroud looked very different in the 16th and 17th centuries from the object we see today,\u201d he writes.\nAn engraving by Antonio Tempesta of a ceremonial display of the shroud to pilgrims in 1613 shows the figure of Christ covered in blood and scourge marks.\n\u201cMy research began with this engraving, as it demonstrated that the original images of the shroud were much more prominent than they are now. The shroud would not have made an impact on such large crowds if they had not been. There are features \u2013 the Crown of Thorns, the long hair on Christ\u2019s neck, the space between the elbows and the body, the loincloth \u2013 that can no longer be seen today,\u201d Mr Freeman writes.\nFifteenth-century accounts of the shroud describe \u201cthe wounds on the side, hands and feet as bloody as if they had been recent\u201d, he says. In 1474 Pope Sixtus IV described the shroud as \u201ccoloured with the blood of Christ\u201d and in the 1530s the Clare nuns, who repaired the shroud after it had been damaged by fire, described \u201cthe traces of a face all bruised and all tortured by blows, his divine head pierced by big thorns, from which blood rills came out and bled into the forehead and divided in various rills covering the forehead with the most precious purple in the world\u201d \u2013 none of which can be seen today.\n\u201cThis new emphasis on the blood of Christ is a development of the 14th century,\u201d Mr Freeman writes, saying that the shroud reflects this iconography. He also points out that the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) in 1988 \u201cdid not have a single expert in the history of relic cults, techniques of ancient weaving or the iconography of medieval painting on its team\u201d.\nBut Barrie Schwortz, an expert in imaging and the official documenting photographer of STURP, dismisses Mr Freeman\u2019s claims.\nMr Schwortz referred to the scientific evidence that is \u201cthe basis for my opinion that the shroud cannot be an artwork. STURP\u2019s data provided empirical evidence to that effect, although the sceptics of the world continue to deny it\u201d."}

This is a story of how it first charmed and then choked the industry it was designed to enhance.\nIt's a long and complicated story, full of challenges and unforeseen consequences. In the first part, I'll explain how some of the strange choices were made by the earliest digital audio engineers.\nIt's 1987, and London Zoo is playing host to a conference called the Digital Information Exchange (DIE) run by HHB \u2013 a professional audio hire and sales company. Theoretical papers are being delivered and real products are being demonstrated from the leading lights of the era, the likes of AMS and Fairlight.\nBut there's an excitement to the event. Something new is emerging, finally. The talk of the show is a brand new digital stereo recording format and milling around me are audio engineers of a quite different nature to the ones sat in studios. These guys are behind the designs of digital recorders, including the multitrack machines that would become the mainstay of well-heeled recording studios for the next 10 years. The fruits of their labour are on display and the future looks bright.\nLooking back, 10 years doesn\u2019t seem long enough to recoup all that technological effort, but it was a necessary step that would eventually take us to desktop music-making and with it, a mass culling of professional recording studios. Song demos and remixes that would once keep a studio busy as a 24-hour concern, were lost to the bard in the bedroom and, inevitably, whole albums would be made by musos sitting around in their underpants.\nDigital audio itself wasn't new, of course. The compact disc was already done and dusted as a consumer product by the early 1980s, along with digital recording in stereo in the studio to facilitate CD masters. Yet on show at the DIE was the means to bring CD-quality audio beyond stereo mastering and use it for the actual track laying in the studio. Admittedly, the phenomenally expensive 3M systems had already captured performances of jazz and classical works along with Donald Fagen\u2019s The Nightfly, years earlier, but here in the flesh was a new generation of digital multitrack recorder, not some technological rarity.\nReadily available for hire or sale, these Japanese reel-to-reel digital tape machines were capable of recording 24-tracks (Sony DASH) or 32-tracks (Mitsubishi ProDigi) on one-inch tape. They were still phenomenally expensive but they were impressive \u2013 Sony would later double the track count to 48 and license its technology to analogue multitrack stalwart, Studer, once considered the Rolls Royce of reel-to-reel recorders.\nAlthough these two tape standards, DASH and ProDigi, were incompatible, they were nonetheless remarkable examples of data storage and precision timing. With analogue-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analogue (D/A) converters for each track, these multitrack recorders also featured digital outputs that conformed to one protocol, the AES/EBU standard. And this was crucial: digital interfacing was the conduit that enabled these recorders to speak unto other digital recorders and mixers.

Take la Dowd\u2019s word for it, he is an intellectual. But, then again, are not all Democrats intellectuals? I think he plays a guitar and tweets. He is so active on his Tweeter account that he supplements his diet of meat and potatoes with birdseed. It helps him tweet. You can tell he resorts to birdseed by the whiteness of his hair.\nAt any rate he is off and running and has the blessing of the Times and Maureen Dowd who likes him because he is a man, a Real Man. What is more, he is a man who puts women in mind of President John F. Kennedy. He has been doing this since at least the mid-1980s, possibly earlier. That is one reason he changed his name from Hartpence (as it appeared on his baptismal documents) to Hart (as it appears on his driver\u2019s license).

On the day of his last ever NBA game, we look back at his imprint on the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise.\nRooting for the Cavs to lose and tank this season is tough. WFNY\u2019s Josh Poloha explains.\nWFNY\u2019s Andrew Schnitkey talks about the recent success of the Cleveland Cavaliers and what it could mean for the rest of the season and beyond.\nAfter All-Star Break Outlook: What\u2019s next for the Cavs?\nThe second half of the NBA Season starts tonight \u2026 What\u2019s the outlook for the 2019 Cavs over the next 24 games?\nAfter participating in and receiving plenty of praise during All-Star Weekend as a Rising Star, Cedi Osman now has his eyes set on becoming an All-Star.\nThe Cavs acquired a handful of draft assets and helped their tanking efforts this season prior to Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, which seems like a win-win situation for the wine and gold.\nAt just 10-41, the Cavs have been quite a disappointment this season. With that said, it\u2019s better to focus on the good things. WFNY\u2019s Josh Poloha takes a look at a number of the positive aspects of the Cavs, especially in 2019.\nJust in case anyone hadn\u2019t noticed, the Cleveland Cavaliers aren\u2019t very good and there\u2019s no clear path out of this mess.\nGiven his salary, size, and ability to score as a lengthy wing, Rodney Hood could be one of the most attractive trade targets prior to the NBA Trade Deadline on February 7.\nHe may be playing for a small, mid-major school but Murray State\u2019s Ja Morant should be getting just as much attention as any 2019 NBA Draft prospect not named Zion Williamson.\nIt\u2019s been 934 days since that special night on June 19, 2016 and the Cavs *still* live in the heads of the Golden State Warriors. This time, they\u2019re crying about what Cleveland did with Patrick McCaw.\nWith LeBron James, you know anything is possible.\nYou might think you want an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, but you\u2019d shoot your eye out, kid. So, here is what you should be hoping to see under the Cleveland sports Christmas tree.\nWhen the February 8 deal went down, it was largely painted as addition by subtraction. The Cavaliers\u2019 locker room was toxic, and Ty Lue had entirely too many mouths\u2014and egos\u2014to feed. WFNY looks back at Koby Altman\u2019s mid-season Hail Mary.\nKevin Love surprised many by signing a contract extension to stay in Cleveland even after LeBron James left for Los Angeles. For the Cavaliers, it was a rare positive moment in a sea of turmoil ever since.\nDelly\u2019s return is as close to an MVP moment as we\u2019re gonna get at the Q this year.\nBol Bol has plenty of question marks surrounding how his game and size will translate to the NBA level, but at 7-foot-2 and with a 7-foot-8 wingspan and 9-foot-7 standing reach, he can be a dominant NBA player if he continues to develop and get stronger."}

This is a 13-hour saga, divided into hourly segments yet cohesive and coherent throughout, so that viewers can hopscotch seamlessly from one installment to the next.\n6: It's All About Location.\nThere is a fad in American television for location to serve as a sort of unofficial extra character.

In the midst of getting divorced from his wife, Vanessa Trump, new revelations have been made about Donald Trump Jr.'s possible infidelities. According to recent reports, Trump Jr. allegedly had an affair with The Celebrity Apprentice contestant Aubrey O'Day in 2011.\nPage Six is covering the gossip. Since filing for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. last week after 13 years together, more information has been leaked about his failing marriage. As it is being reported today, Trump Jr. allegedly began cheating on Vanessa Trump with Aubrey O'Day when his wife was pregnant with their third child, Tristan. Sources close to Vanessa say he even reportedly intended to leave Vanessa for Aubrey, which \"devastated\" his wife at the time. According to the unnamed source, it was Don Jr. who \"pursued\" Aubrey into the relationship. He was the one who apparently chased after the singer/TV personality.\nThe affair was reported to be \"the downfall\" of their relationship, according to one of the sources. Or maybe not? According to the insider, the marriage between Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump was in trouble before Aubrey O'Day entered the picture via The Celebrity Apprentice, on which Don Jr. was an advisor. The report claims that Don Jr.'s relationship allegedly was \"already in the process of dissolving\" and that his marriage was in serious jeopardy before O'Day was involved. So maybe it was already on the rocks whenever Aubrey became involved with their lives? Nevertheless, the couple stayed together for seven more years, perhaps in an attempt to keep their family together.\nWhen Donald Trump first heard about the affair between Donald Trump Jr. and Aubrey O'Day, the future president reportedly stepped in and told his son to cut it out. Another source claims it was the Trump family who allegedly \"pressured\" Don Jr. into staying married to his wife. In any case, the relationship that ensued between Don Jr. and Aubrey O'Day was seemingly one built around love, not money or fame, as the couple would meet up in various cities during their rendezvous together, and would reportedly pen love notes to one another throughout the heat of their relationship. O'Day never sought out money from the famous family, and she was ultimately never paid by them either. And O'Day hasn't necessarily kept completely quiet about it.\nOn Election Night 2016, Aubrey O'Day sent a since-deleted tweet, which can now be placed to the affair she reportedly had with Donald Trump Jr.\nMy story I didn't tell is worth millions now.\nIf that doesn't give you any clues, Aubrey O'Day even wrote a song seemingly about her relationship with Donald Trump Jr. The reality TV personality released an EP in 2013 called Between Two Evils, which featured a break-up track called \"DJT\" at the very top.

But starting from February next year, we'll train them to be a better sensor when it comes to seniors with needs.\"\nHe said that volunteers would learn how to identify and categorise how frail seniors are, so that they could then receive the appropriate help. Eventually, he added, volunteers would be able to detect problems early, so that seniors can be prevented from getting frail in the first place.\nMr Heng, in his speech, said that \"we must learn from the existences of the CNS pilots\" through the multi-agency review, adding: \"The outcome of these discussions could be in the form of new processes or better use of technology.\"\nThe review, which will involve the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the People's Association and the Agency for Integrated Care, began this year.\nMr Neo said there is no end date yet as it depends on what the review finds.\nThe pilot began in Choa Chu Kang, Marine Parade and Tampines GRCs.\nMore than 1,000 seniors in total attend active ageing programmes in the three sites.

There can be up to 6% to pay - 3% as initial commission to the broker and the rest to the fund manager.\nThe spread can also contain 1% or 2% extra costs to the investor. This charge is used by the fund manager to help control buying and selling pressures.\nThese figures are less punishing if you are invested in an Oeic, a new type of unit trust which has only one price for buying and selling, and if you use a discount or execution-only broker to buy funds. Another point to remember is that Jupiter does not pay renewal commission, an annual payment usually of 0.5%, to IFAs on straight unit trust investments. It pays the commission on Isas and Peps only.\nHowever, other companies including ABN Amro, BWD Rensburg, Perpetual and Credit Suisse do pay this commission on unit trust investments. Investors should therefore watch out that the alternative to their Jupiter investment being offered is in their best interest, not just their adviser's.\nJason Hollands, deputy managing director of Best Investments, is one of the independent financial advisers in the anti-Jupiter camp. He is telling his clients - all 40,000 of them - to leave the Jupiter funds.\nHe says: 'John Duffield was the reason why Jupiter was so successful. Now he has left, there is a power vacuum. There is too much potential for ongoing disputes and for fund managers to leave.\n'We want to do the best thing for our clients ahead of any deterioration by leaving the funds.' Jupiter Income has turned \u00a31,000 into \u00a31,081 in the past three months, while the average fund in its sector made \u00a31,053. It is ranked 29 out of 93 funds in the sector.\nBecause it is doing well, Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there is no reason to sell yet.\nHe says: 'We all went into the fund originally because of William, but he has gone now. We can't follow him, and there is no replica replacement.\nHe adds that John Duffield did not manage any funds, so his departure has little relevance for investors."}

Their ultimate goal is to design a superconducting material that works at room temperature.\nThe results are published Oct. 19 in Nature Physics.\nThe researchers used an emerging X-ray technique called resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, or RIXS, to measure how the properties of a copper oxide change as extra electrons are added in a process known as doping. The team used the Swiss Light Source\u2019s RIXS instrument, which currently has the world's highest resolution and can reveal atomic-scale excitations \u2013 rapid changes in magnetism, electrical charge and other properties \u2013 as they move through the material.\nCopper oxide, a ceramic that normally doesn\u2019t conduct electricity at all, becomes superconducting only when doped with other elements to add or remove electrons and chilled to low temperatures. Intriguingly, the electron-rich version loses its superconductivity when warmed to about 30 degrees above absolute zero (30 kelvins) while the electron-poor one remains superconducting up to 120 kelvins (minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit). One of the goals of the new research is to understand why they behave so differently.\nThe experiments revealed a surprising increase of magnetic energy and the emergence of a new collective excitation in the electron-rich compounds, said Wei-sheng Lee, a SLAC staff scientist and lead author on the Nature Physics paper. \u201cIt\u2019s very puzzling that these new electronic phenomena are not seen in the electron-poor material,\u201d he said.\nLee added that it\u2019s unclear whether the new collective excitation is related to the ability of electrons to pair up and effortlessly conduct electricity \u2013 the hallmark of superconductivity \u2013 or whether it promotes or limits high-temperature superconductivity. Further insight can be provided by additional experiments using next-generation RIXS instruments that will become available in a few years at synchrotron light sources worldwide.\nThis discovery is the latest step in the long and tortuous path toward understanding high-temperature superconductivity.\nScientists have known since the late 1950s why certain metals and simple alloys become superconducting when chilled within a few degrees of absolute zero: Their electrons pair up and ride waves of atomic vibrations that act like a virtual glue to hold the pairs together. Above a certain temperature, however, the glue fails as thermal vibrations increase, the electron pairs split up and superconductivity disappears.\nStarting in 1986, researchers discovered a number of materials that are superconducting at higher temperatures. By understanding and optimizing how these materials work, they hope to develop superconductors that work at room temperature and above.\nUntil recently, the most likely glue holding superconducting electron pairs together at higher temperatures seemed to be strong magnetic excitations created by interactions between electron spins. But a recent theoretical simulation by SLAC and Stanford researchers concluded that these high-energy magnetic interactions are not the sole factor in copper oxide\u2019s high-temperature superconductivity. The new results confirm that prediction, and also complement a 2012 report on the behavior of electron-poor copper oxides by a team that included Lee, Devereaux and several"}

Public Policy Institute of California polls last week and last month also showed Prop 6 lagging. And that is raising questions about GOP plans for competing in a state where voters\u2019 appetites have grown for new taxes.\n\u201cThis was supposed to show the limits of liberalism in California and put the fear of God or the fear of Prop 13 into the hearts of future legislators hoping \u2026 to raise taxes,\u201d said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego.\nProposition 13 was California\u2019s famous 1978 property tax revolt against levies that were growing by double digits with soaring home values. Its passage made Democrats such as Gov. Jerry Brown, who also was governor back then, wary of the potential for tax blowback.\nInitially, the Legislature\u2019s gas tax hike last year, which also raised vehicle fees and taxes on diesel, seemed a potential disaster for California\u2019s ruling Democrats.

Initially, the project was to be a joint mission with Russia, whose space agency Roscomos was to supply the lander. However, that deal fell through and Isro decided to go solo.\nThe decision on how many orbits the Lander will make has not yet been taken, but it will be a 100x30 (100km on one side and 30 on the other) elliptical orbit, which means that the entire configuration of the mission has now changed, in effect, causing the delay.\n\u201cEarlier, the plan was to gradually go down from 100km and reach 18km from the Moon\u2019s surface. From there, the orientation would change, making the Lander go slightly horizontal for about 8.5km and then we were to change the orientation and velocity further to make the soft landing,\u201d a senior member of the Chandrayaan-2 team said.\nNow, as per the revised plans, the Lander has to go around the surface of the moon before entering the descent phase. Scientists working on the project say that this change in plan could have been avoided as the earlier configuration that was cleared would have achieved the main mission goals.\n\u201cThis additional activity required by the Lander means a host of new hardware added. This is one method of achieving the landing, while the earlier one was another. Our job is to follow what the chairman and other seniors decide and develop things that can successfully complete the mission,\u201d another scientist said.\nThis has also increased Chandrayaan-2 weight from 3,250kg to 3,850kg, which has prompted some changes, including moving to GSLV MK-III instead of the GSLV MK-II, which would have required an uprate to accommodate the additional weight.\nAs per the new configuration cleared after the fourth Comprehensive Technical Review (CTR) meeting held on June 19, among other things, the Lander would require a fifth liquid engine to manage the additional load of having to orbit, along with other hardware including a transponder which it earlier didn\u2019t need.\n\u201cAll these last-minute changes means that we have to test all the new hardware and then begin the fabrication process, which will delay the project.

Based on the 1999 play by Ronald Harwood, a distinguished British writer whose work includes The Dresser, The Pianist, and The Diving Bell And The Butterfly, Quartet falls into the common actor-turned-director trap of valuing the performances of fellow actors over all other aesthetic concerns. Beloved old-timers like Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon, Pauline Collins, and Billy Connolly are trotted out for slow-clap encores\u2014literally, in two scenes\u2014but the film around them is a genial bore, full of underplayed drama and mildly frisky comedy. It\u2019s a cup of decaf by the sitting window.\nMaking minimal effort to open up the play for the big screen, Hoffman stages all the action in Beecham House, a special retirement community for opera musicians. Though many of the retirees have lost some of their agility and voice, they nonetheless continue to perform with and for each other, filling the drawing rooms and gazebos with beautiful music. In many respects, Quartet is a lot like Fame, but instead of people breaking out in impromptu song-and-dance numbers, they break out in ornery reminiscences about the past. Many of the latter come courtesy of Maggie Smith, who arrives at Beecham a celebrated diva with a freight of emotional baggage, some related to an ex (Courtenay) with whom she has unresolved issues. Smith and Courtenay once formed a quartet with Connolly and Collins, but she\u2019s reluctant to reunite for an upcoming fundraising gala that might stabilize Beecham\u2019s dwindling finances.\nAs the obligatory randy old dog, Connolly brings Quartet what little spark it has, working his rogue charm around the home\u2019s attractive young administrator and any other woman who crosses his path. The biggest disappointment in Quartet, though, is how little Smith is given to do, especially considering how often she\u2019s called upon to play haughtiness for wicked laughs. But her dispute with Courtenay, the heart of the drama, amounts to a wan exchange of passive-aggression, all pushing toward the inevitable gala performance that will end the damned thing. The film, along with its characters, goes all too quietly into that goodnight.\nFor thoughts on, and a place to discuss, plot details not talked about in this review, visit Quartet\u2019s Spoiler Space."}

The revelation comes at an opportune time when African storytelling in film and dance has gained global prominence in recent years.\n2018 has been an exciting time for African storytelling in film production, and in various other art forms. The global success of the Black Panther movie put into focus the urgency for Africans to take pride, and seize the leading role in telling their own realities rather than waiting for foreigners to create and curate such important conversations. African narratives, and experiences are in abundance and these realities have always been valid, but there has been a void in telling these stories, for both African and global audiences.\nThankfully there is a shift. There has been a number of adaptation projects announced this year, which include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel Americanah and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah's bestselling autobiography Born a Crime: Stories from a Southern African Childhood.\nThe latest revelation of an adaptation is Ngugi wa Thiong'o's 1987 novel Matigari, which is being made into film by Nollywood director Kunle Afolayan in a co-production with Kenyan, and South African filmmakers. The co-producers are yet to be disclosed.\nAfolayan revealed the news on the sidelines of the African Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) that took place in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\"Ngugi is like the Wole Soyinka of Nigeria in Kenya and one of his books is going to be adapted into a film\". \"It's going to be South Africa-Kenya-Nigeria co-production and I'm representing Nigeria,\" Afolayan added.\nThe novel is moral and political tale in which Matigari, the protagonist, a freedom fighter, emerges from the bush in the political dawn of post-independence Kenya. He searches for his family and a new future , but finds that not much has since changed. The book deals with various themes, which include oppression, and exploitation, inequality, and betrayal.\nWhat is commendable and encouraging is that Africans are continuing to take a keen interest in telling their stories using film and cinema but more still needs to change. There is a lack of domestic investment in the film industry and the infantilism of it elsewhere on the continent is evident.\nRecently, global streaming giant Netflix revealed that it is injecting an $8 billion original production budget into Nollywood the world's second largest film industry. While this is an immense win for Nollywood, the investment points to the lack of domestic investment in the film industry and the infantilism of it elsewhere on the continent.\nAlthough Africa has shown the biggest progression of internet users in recent years, suggestively increasing access to local content, many African countries do not have a booming film industry like Nollywood.\nFunding, distribution and profitability are still sore points, the persisting 30-year old colonial heritages of filmmaking, distribution and exhibition, western preferences by viewers and lack of domestic investment are the main causes of an infantile film industry in most African countries. Censorship has also played a key role in undermining films even after the bypass all other production obstacles."}

He became a US citizen and in 2006 settled in Portland, Oregon. His problems began soon after 2010 when he went back to Khartoum, where he still had relatives, to start an electronics import business.\nIn Sudan he was summoned to the US Embassy on false pretenses and was told by two FBI agents from Oregon that they wanted to ask him a few questions about his mosque in Portland. When Fikre demanded a lawyer and hesitated to answer questions about people he had prayed at the mosque with but barely knew \u2013 the agents told him he was placed on a no-fly list. Although there was \u201cabsolutely no factual justification\u201d for that, his lawyer, Thomas Nelson, told RT.\nTaking threats into account, he still managed to fly to his relatives in Sweden. He concluded that he was not in fact deemed a serious threat and the FBI agents had been bluffing, although he wondered whether had he flown to a close US ally such as Britain that this would also have been the case.\nHe got a chance to find that out after he went to the UAE, one of the US\u2019s closet allies in the Middle East, and was suddenly arrested by the local police.\nFikre was held and tortured in UAE prison for 106 days from June to September 2011. During this time he was continually beaten and repeatedly asked about events in Portland, Oregon \u2013 the same questions that the FBI asked him earlier.\n\u201cDuring the torture he was always blindfolded, and so he could not see who was doing the interrogating and who else was in the room, although he was aware that there were others. With the exception that he could occasionally look underneath the blindfold and see pants, trousers, shoes and dress of that sort. Sometimes there was Western dress, sometimes there was Arabic dress,\u201d his lawyer explained to RT.\nAfter eventually being released \u2013 without any charges \u2013 Fikre managed to return to Sweden and over the next three years managed to prove that he had been tortured while in custody in the UAE, although he and his legal team are convinced they can not prove that this was at the behest of the US authorities.\n\u201cDuring the course of 3 years there, the Swedish authorities investigated what happened to him and they came to a conclusion that Yonas indeed had been tortured. Their problem was that they had a hard time proving that it was the FBI or the American authorities that instigated and performed the torturing. It was not a question of whether the torture occurred, it was a question of whether they can prove that the Americans were behind it,\u201d he explained.\nAlthough there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence, Thomas Nelson says they are having hard time proving the US authorities took part in the torture.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those difficult things because when the most powerful nation on earth wants to hide something, it can do it very easily.

Let me begin with a picture showing how we compare to Finland\u2014everyone\u2019s favorite educational success story and a country not noted for paying its teachers especially well. Then we\u2019ll talk some about the right way to make international teacher salary comparisons. After that, some more data.\nEven against modest-paying Finland, American teachers are underpaid. If we wanted to raise the relative salaries of American teachers to the level seen in Finland, we\u2019d require a 10 percent raise for primary school teachers, an 18 percent raise in lower secondary, and a 28 percent raise for upper secondary school teachers.\nWhat is the right way to make international comparisons of teacher salaries? The answer depends on why you think salaries are important. Is it because someone with a particular set of qualifications deserves a certain level of pay? Or perhaps some general level of fairness or equity? To an economist, the answer is rather different: you want to pay enough to attract really good people to become teachers in the first place and to remain in teaching rather than bailing out for a more lucrative career. That means that the right way to compare across countries is to look at how teacher pay within the country compares to pay in alternative careers that a person might consider when deciding whether to become a teacher.\nThe OECD has put together a set of comparisons of teacher pay to earnings of all college graduates. These are the numbers shown in the chart above, and the numbers used throughout this post. You can see in the chart that both Finland and the United States pay teachers less than they pay other college graduates, but Finland gets notably closer than we do.\nI picked Finland for the comparison in the chart above because, well because lots of countries aspire to be Finland when it comes to education. While paying better than the U.S., Finland is pretty much an average player when it comes to teacher pay. Most of the developed countries with which we compete pay much better. Here\u2019s the relevant picture taken directly from the OECD\u2019s Education at a Glance 2015.\nThe quick lesson is that in most industrialized countries relative teacher pay is higher than in the United States. To see the gap in a different way, the next chart tells how much the U.S. would have to raise upper secondary salaries to match relative salaries in a variety of other countries. Just as we saw for the example of Finland in the opening graphic, the gaps are even larger for upper secondary than for lower secondary.\nWhile American salaries aren\u2019t the lowest, many other countries not only pay better, but the gap is really, really big.\nThe simple summary: Other countries make teaching a more financially attractive career for college graduates than we do.\nThe facts are the facts. But allow me to predict one response to these facts: \u201cTeachers aren\u2019t motivated by money, they teach because they love it.\u201d Often true. And I\u2019ve noticed that the people who say that teachers teach for love are quite often themselves very good teachers. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to imagine someone who teaches well who doesn\u2019t like their students. However, it\u2019s very easy to imagine many, many potential teachers\u2014who would also love their students just as much\u2014who have made the decision to forego a teaching career in order to better provide for their family.\nDollars aren\u2019t the only thing that determines career choice. Prestige and working conditions matter too. (Finland pays a fair amount better than the U.S. The prestige attached to being a teacher is enormously higher.) My guess is that being a teacher has both more prestige and better working conditions in other industrialized countries"}

Setting its pricing at $9 per share yesterday, the stock opened up 27% higher at $11.40 on its first trade \u2014 a modest rise and by no means a bust. Things got even more positive as the day went on: it rose steadily throughout Thursday, and at market close market close it was at nearly 49% above its opening price, at $13.65 per share.\nThat puts Zendesk\u2019s current market cap at something between $940 million and $955 million.\nAt $9 per share for the 11,111,111 shares Zendesk was offering, this was squarely in the middle of the $8 to $10 range the company most recently projected.\nZendesk raised just short of $100 million \u2014 although that was some $50 million short of the amount originally planned for when it first filed for its IPO around a month ago. The $9/share price values Zendesk at around $632 million.\nZendesk, originally founded in Denmark but now based in San Francisco, is tapping into a couple of bigger trends at the moment.\nThe first is the general surge in enterprise startups over the last year or so, in the wake of several years of focus on consumer plays.\nAnd the second is the big shift to cloud services, tapping into the growth of better data networks and mobile devices with less storage, as a way to deliver them more efficiently.\nZendesk says it has some 42,000 customer accounts from 140 countries at the moment and has been growing quickly. Revenues in 2013 were $72 million, up 88% on a year before. The first quarter of 2014 to March 31 saw sales of $25.1 million, up 80% on the same quarter a year ago.\nBut while cloud-based businesses have been one of the biggest growth engines in enterprise technology, they have been doing so on a much thinner margin base than their larger, legacy competitors.\nZendesk had a net loss in 2013 of $22.6 million, down by some $2 million from the year before, while its net loss for Q1 2014 nearly doubled to $10.3 million. It looks like, for now, Zendesk will be taking a similar approach to growth by not focusing on positive net income. \u201cWe intend to invest aggressively to drive continued growth and market leadership,\u201d the company noted in its S-1. That has included making its first acquisition, of Singapore-based live chat help provider Zopim, for just under $30 million.\nWorth noting that Zendesk is not alone here, and in some ways is in healthier position if you are tracking revenues versus losses. Box, which has filed for a $250 million IPO, says that its 2013 revenues were $124 million but with net losses of $168 million. Some have floated the idea that Box will delay its IPO although the company has not confirmed those reports."}

It was a very long time ago, and I do consider it one of the worst decisions ever made. But I had just had my first child, and I just\u2026I don\u2019t know, I was a little housebound. [\u2026] It\u2019s really definitely a regret.\nTo be fair, dragging a new mother and her child down to New Zealand for a long film shoot on a project that was far from a sure thing is not ideal. Can you blame her? No one knew that the Lord of the Rings movies were actually going to work until the first one was in theaters, somehow working. Besides, the alternate universe where Thurman said yes to this role is the alternate universe where filming overlapped with Kill Bill, keeping her from taking on her greatest role.\nPlus, it\u2019s hard to argue against Miranda Otto\u2019s performance as Eowyn, who brought the perfect blend of ferocity and tenderness to the role. Plus-plus, Thurman was probably a little too recognizable for the part, especially since the Lord of the Rings trilogy benefitted from actors capable of completely vanishing inside their characters.\nNow we can toss this Uma Thurman tidbit on the pile of Lord of the Rings trivia for future generations to enjoy. It now sits alongside the story of how Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart reportedly turned down Gandalf the Grey. It\u2019s shelved next to Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s Frodo audition. It resides with the many, many actors who were apparently connected to Aragorn at some point, including Daniel Day-Lewis (!), Nicolas Cage (!!), Russell Crowe (!!!) and Vin Diesel (!!!!).

{"idx": "2417", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Will VW's Tennessee workers say yes to the UAW? Let's hope so.\nThursday is the second of three days of a union-organizing vote at Volkswagen's Tennessee auto assembly plant, and it's being tracked like a congressional special election. Is it a bellwether for the state of modern labor? Or is it a one-off that says nothing of significance beyond the confines of the VW factory floor?\nIt\u2019s a bit of both. The vote has attracted an extraordinary amount of outside interest and pressure, including misleading public billboards, bizarre claims on local talk-radio stations and a general frothing from the anti-union right that worker-management cooperation is the first step toward Stalinism. The organizing vote also seems to have brought out the worst in some Republican state politicians, who have threatened future financial help for VW projects if the United Auto Workers wins the election. As my colleague Jon Healey wrote Wednesday, that is an inappropriate threat.\nBut I go further: The politicians are wrong to oppose this (especially those who usually condemn government meddling in private business; why are they meddling now?). As is the Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform, which has been spending heavily to try to persuade the VW workers to remain unorganized (it's mystifying what a private labor agreement has to do with tax reform).\nVW has a history of using worker-management committees to help run its factories, resolve disputes and keep everyone involved in making its cars vested and happy. Similar labor-management committees cropped up in the U.S. in the 1970s and '80s. Under U.S. laws barring company-directed unions, if VW wants to establish a worker committee like the ones in Germany, the workers must first be represented by an independent union. VW has said fine, if that's the law and what its employees want, welcome to Chattanooga, UAW.\nThis is between VW and its workers, but the fear of a reinvigorated labor movement clearly has goaded the anti-labor right into action, which makes this an important election. If, against this headwind of propaganda and political opposition in a state with anti-union \"right-to-work\" laws, the UAW can win an organizing battle, maybe we're seeing a turning of the tide.\nIt's probably quixotic, but I'm hoping for a union win and fresh energy in the labor movement. (Full disclosure: I once spent 18 months on a picket line in Detroit in the 1990s, supported in part by UAW members). We often hear comments that the good-paying blue-collar union jobs of the past are gone forever, and they probably are. But it's not as if they evaporated into thin air; the work is being done, just in other countries. Federal labor and trade policies enabled that collapse. Steel is still being made, but not as much of it is being made here. That industry followed the off-shoring of the textile and shoe industries (which notably moved from labor-friendly Northeastern states to the anti-union South before going to lower-wage foreign factories). These days, it's call centers, technical assistance and research work that is moving to cheaper labor markets.\nUnions didn\u2019t kill those industries, and by extension the American middle class. This is the result of Washington\u2019s near-religious embrace of global free markets, and it\u2019s a shared faith among Republicans and Democrats, even those who win elections with union"}

{"idx": "2422", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Apple's impact on health care has been nothing short of revolutionary. Here's why.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't necessarily intend to revolutionize health care, but that's exactly what happened. Health care has changed dramatically since Steve Jobs first stood in front of an audience to introduce first the iPhone then later the iPad. Much of that change can be directly attributed to Apple.\nIt used to be said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away. That could still be applicable, but the opposite is true for doctors and Apple. Physicians love their iPhones and iPads.\nA study by Manhattan Research in 2011 found that 75% of physicians owned at least one Apple product. Vitera Healthcare's 2012 survey of health-care professionals backed up this high number. The company's study found that 60% of respondents used an iPhone and 45% owned an iPad.\nThe real revolution, though, has come from how physicians and other health-care professionals are using Apple's devices. Mobile applications opened the door for clinicians to instantly access a world of medical information at the point of care.\nFor example, WebMD's (NASDAQ:WBMD) Medscape application allows physicians to check drug interactions, look up information about procedures, and see medical news updates on the fly. Medscape ranks first among the most frequently downloaded medical apps for iPhones and iPads.\nYale University's School of Medicine even did away with paper materials for training upcoming physicians. The school provided iPads and wireless keyboards to all of its medical students. Other schools followed suit.\nHealth eVillages' experience underscores the transformational impact of Apple's technology. The not-for-profit organization provides mobile health technology to medical professionals in areas such as Kenya and Haiti. Lives have been saved that otherwise would have been lost, thanks to doctors in remote areas who use an iPad to access needed information.\nUse of Apple's products goes beyond serving as a reference tool, though. An application that allows radiologists to view MRIs as well as CT, PET, and SPECT scans on iPhones and iPads received FDA approval in 2011. More recently, the FDA cleared the way for privately held Welch Allyn to connect its portable ophthalmoscope to an iPhone for doctors to view retinal images using the company's app.\nApple perhaps unwittingly opened new horizons for patients also. By April 2012, the company's App Store included more than 13,600 health-related applications.\nA peek at some of the current top-selling apps shows how much Apple's technology has empowered patients. One application allows individuals to monitor their sleep cycles. Another provides a detailed guide to help expectant mothers through their pregnancies.\nPharmaceutical companies are getting into the act. For example, Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS) recently introduced an app for iPhones (and Android phones) that complements its weight-loss drug. The app allows patients to record what they eat and track their weight plus receive regular information updates.\nVital Art and Science recently gained FDA approval to sell its myVisionTrack product, which enables people with macular degeneration and other degenerative eye diseases to monitor their vision at home with their iPhone.

When she finally decided she was ready to open the store, after working here as a social worker, Mattes drew on what she had learned spending a work-study semester away from college under the tutelage of a New York City publisher. She invested her inheritance from the family estate in buying the building where the store is housed. Mattes also spent a field term with Otto Penzler at the Mysterious Bookshop in New York City.\nKate's Mystery Books hosts regular author readings, sometimes about one a week, more typically the third Wednesday of the month, in the evening at the store.

Delta claims it wants agreements with specific partners \u201cenforced,\u201d but their actions don\u2019t match their rhetoric.\nFirst, Delta has not gone through the established Department of Transportation process to address their complaint. Instead, they\u2019re asking the Trump Administration simply to freeze access to the U.S. market for two Open Skies partners. This would breach Open Skies and invite other countries to walk away from their commitments to the United States, which would harm jobs in Minnesota and across the U.S.\nOpen Skies agreements don\u2019t just cover passenger carriers like Delta, they also enable cargo carriers like FedEx to transport goods globally.\nFedEx relies on our network of Open Skies agreements to ship made-in-America products from Minnesota small businesses to customers across the world, which in turn creates local jobs. For example, in Minnesota\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, FedEx employs more than 1,500 team members. These jobs, and the local businesses relying on our supply routes to sell their products, would be jeopardized if we start dismantling our Open Skies agreements.\nFedEx cares about its customers and employees in Minnesota. That\u2019s why it has teamed up with Atlas Air Worldwide, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue Airways to form a coalition called U.S. Airlines for Open Skies to uphold these agreements and protect the thousands of jobs these agreements support.\nIf we really want to support Minnesota\u2019s businesses and entrepreneurs that help grow our state\u2019s economy, then we should uphold our Open Skies agreements.\nIt\u2019s time to stop insisting that the 38 Dakota warriors hanged in Mankato 150 years ago had it coming.

The violence inflicted by the brief uprising was real and tragic.\nBut what we need to be clear about today is that the Dakota were provoked, having lost their land, their means of self-support, their dignity, and their ability to survive because of the rules they had to live under.\nIf today\u2019s reflective Minnesotans want to point out what it was that white Christian Minnesotans did to the Dakota people that led to the uprising, decent people should not complain that only the Dakota were vile.

The paper\u2019s article Wednesday about the arrest did not identify the suspect by name.\nAccording to ABC, police flagged the woman in 2016 after noticing her several times near the embassy in Madrid, including in the presence of unidentified men. Police reportedly followed the woman and discovered her identity, leading counterterrorist researchers to monitor her activities online.\nOn Facebook, where the woman moderated one anti-Israel group with more than 2,000 subscribers, the researchers documented the suspect praising Hamas and speaking favorably about the murder of Jews, leading to her arrest.\nAcross Western Europe, authorities have increased their vigilance of hate speech against Jews following several jihadist attacks against Jewish targets in France, where in January 2015 a jihadist killed four Jews at a Paris kosher store, and Belgium, where four people were murdered the previous year in an armed attack at the Jewish Museum of Brussels.\nLast week, French police arrested a man in Marseille, France, Nacer Bendrer, on suspicion that he acted as an accomplice to the Frenchman currently on trial in Belgium for the museum killing, the RTL broadcaster reported.

It\u2019s their political disposition.\nEarly votes in Pulaski County were overwhelmingly Democratic and, in the extraordinary nail-biter of a Little Rock mayor\u2019s race, different from those of election day for some reason not so clearly partisan.\nIt may have to do with race, with a disproportionate number of blacks voting early and a much larger percentage of whites waiting until election day.\n\u2022 When the early votes were dumped about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday by the Pulaski County Election Commission, they showed state Rep. Clarke Tucker, the Democrat, with a sterling lead of 42,000 to 24,000 over incumbent Republican French Hill in the 2nd District congressional race. That suggested he might, with the addition of the election-day returns, build an eventual lead big enough in Pulaski to remain competitive as Hill inevitably routed him\u2014as he surely did\u2014in the raging red regions of Saline, Faulkner and White counties.\nBut, as the election-day returns trickled in, Tucker struggled to add to his margin. It was at this late-evening writing up only by 9,000, to 27,000, even as the election-day turnout was close to equal to the early-vote turnout. That was hardly enough to dent a Hill victory margin that appeared to be in the not-at-all-close 52-46 range.\n\u2022 In the extraordinary first-of-its-kind race for a higher-profile mayor of Little Rock, Frank Scott, the African American candidate, had a big plurality of nearly 38 percent\u201413,000 votes to 9,000 or so for Baker Kurrus and 8,000 or so for Warwick Sabin\u2014in the early voting. But in the election-day returns, Kurrus and Sabin ran close to each other and closer to him. He wound up with about 25,000 votes while Kurrus had only a few hundred more than Sabin, with both in the 20,000 range.\nIn the final analysis, the 2nd District re-proved itself red and embedded that way. The big blue island of Pulaski is not as blue as the suburban counties are red.\nAnd the mayoral race\u2019s likely runoff between Scott and Kurrus, with a few precincts still out at this writing, would pit eastern and southern Little Rock, which provide Scott\u2019s base, against west Little Rock, which is Kurrus\u2019 base. The deciders would turn out to be the midtown liberals who embraced Sabin, and whose leanings probably would be to Kurrus owing to his public-school service and Scott\u2019s social conservatism. But it could turn out more complicated than that\u2014for some voters, anyway.\nNationally, the story Tuesday was reminiscent of an old country song in which the woman tells the man he wasn\u2019t the wave, but just the water.\nThere was no Democratic wave.

Sharp, bright screen. Improved performance. Excellent interface. Cloud-based storage. Vast ebook store.\nNo adaptive backlight, waterproofing, or audiobook support.\nThanks to a sharp display and fast performance, Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite is the best ebook reader you can buy for the price.\nThe Amazon Kindle Paperwhite sends the Kindle Voyage packing. The Voyage already struggled to justify its high $199.99 price tag beyond the strength of its 1,448-by-1,072-pixel, 300-ppi E Ink Carta screen, and the latest Paperwhite has the same sharp display, without raising its original base price of $119.99. It also has increased RAM for faster performance, along with access to Amazon's superlative ebook store. The Paperwhite is the best ebook reader you can get for the price, and an easy pick for our Editors' Choice.\nFirst, it's worth mentioning there are a couple of different versions of the Paperwhite available. The standard Wi-Fi-only model costs $119.99 with \"Special Offers\" (Amazon's code for advertising, which is a full-page ad that appears onscreen when your Paperwhite is sleeping) and $139.99 ad-free. A version with 3G wireless connectivity\u2014so you can download books any time, without the need for Wi-Fi\u2014boosts the price to $189.99 with ads and $209.99 without. I tested the $209.99 version, but we're basing our rating on the base model, since most users will be fine with Wi-Fi and ads.\nLike the Voyage, the Paperwhite uses a six-inch Carta E Ink touch screen, with a resolution of 1,448 by 1,072 and 300 pixels per inch. Simply put, the display is terrific. Text is incredibly sharp and dark, and the screen is glare-free. I was able to read in direct sunlight, on the subway, on the bus, and everywhere else I carried it without issue. It's one of the best ebook reader screens you'll find, although it lacks the adaptive backlight in the Voyage, which is basically an automatic brightness sensor. And it doesn't get as bright as the Kindle Oasis, although you'll have no trouble seeing it in the dark. The Paperwhite is also missing the Voyage's page turn buttons on the left and right bezels. These are small nitpicks though, since the Paperwhite's brightness is easy to adjust via the onscreen menu, and the touch screen is perfectly usable for turning pages and moving around the interface.\nThe 3G version of the Paperwhite weighs 7.2 ounces and measures 6.7 by 4.6 by 0.4 inches (HWD). Placing it in a case will add to that, but it never felt too heavy or uncomfortable to read. The power port is still on the bottom, alongside an LED charging indicator and the Power button. Once again, there is no headphone jack, because audiobook support isn't available.\nUnfortunately, Amazon has yet to make its Kindle lineup waterproof, something that the Kobo Glo"}

Could 'all you can app' plans offer a solution?\nNot too long ago, almost one in two German mobile users didn't even know what LTE was. But after substantial infrastructure investment , speed increases , and marketing by Germany's mobile carriers, the majority of users are now aware of the technology and would adopt it \u2014 even if they're not so keen on paying for it.\n\"Germans are not reluctant to take LTE, but they are quite reluctant compared to others to pay for it,\" said Klaus B\u00f6hm, Deloitte Consulting's director of technology, media, and telecommunications in Germany. Deloitte recently completed a study, which looked at mobile consumer behaviour of people in over 20 countries across the world, including Germany as well as the UK and France, Russia, and the US, among others.\nB\u00f6hm says that German smartphone users are quite aware of LTE and its benefits, but that for many, the decision to adopt it simply comes down to cost.\nThe Alcatel One Touch Fire is now headed to Deutsche Telekom's Congstar brand.\n\"Germans are willing to use LTE, and the LTE infrastructure will be successful here in Germany, but the network operators will not be successful in upselling from 3G to LTE,\" B\u00f6hm said.\nIn fact, Germany was an early adopter of LTE \u2014 regulators in the country saw it as a great way to supplement limited broadband service in rural parts of the country, and carriers started rolling out the service for this purpose in late 2010. Because of these initial conditions of the early launch, \"the uptake is going to be relatively slow, if you compare it to the initial rate of uptake in the UK, where it launched on a completely different basis,\" said Rosalind Craven, senior research analyst at IDC.\nIndeed, mobile carriers began offering LTE-capable smartphones in 2012, which means that German mobile users haven't had all that much time to adopt the service \u2014 especially because Germans tend to be a bit slower to replace their old, non-LTE phones than mobile users in some other countries.\n\"There is a generalisation to be made that German consumers are a bit more prudent and cautious, and so the renewal cycle has been a bit slower than in other markets in Europe,\" Craven said.\nHowever, prudence doesn't explain everything.\nIn fact, according to the recent Deloitte report, a majority of current LTE users in Germany are not actually paying extra for 4G, but were either grandfathered into it, or got the service through promotions or by negotiating with their mobile providers. Many German smartphone users, it seems, are not willing to pay extra for LTE \u2014 at least not yet.\nIn terms of current smartphone plan options in the country, the main selling point of LTE connectivity is of course increased speed compared to 3G. For example, for its 3G packages, Vodafone advertises speeds of up to 7.2Mbps, while its advertised speeds of LTE plans start at 21.6Mbps, at an added cost of \u20ac10 per month.\nA main reason that smartphone users in Germany are less willing to pay the extra \u20ac10 (or more) for LTE packages may be the way in which mobile carriers introduced the technology.

We\u2019ve never seen this kind of thing before \u2013 at least, not so out in the open. Certainly there have been internal power struggles and plenty of palace intrigue, but this kind of left-right near unanimity, coupled with the brazen activism of the \u201cintelligence community,\u201d is unprecedented.

We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u2019 Trump said.\nThis linkage is, indeed, the missing link that is always absent from ostensibly libertarian critiques of Trumpian trade protectionism. Well, yes, it\u2019s quite true that tariffs are taxes, that they hurt consumers \u2013 i.e., everyone \u2013 and benefit only a few producers at the expense of the rest of us. Yet these libertarian critics never mention that we are also paying for the defense of our trading partners, a gigantic subsidy that is an essential part of the deal we make with our Asian and European protectorates. In exchange for giving, say, South Korea unobstructed access to our markets, Seoul essentially gives up its sovereignty by allowing US soldiers to occupy the country.\nTrump rightly derides this arrangement as a bad deal, and he is right about that \u2013 although you won\u2019t hear his libertarian critics give him credit for this insight for the simple reason that they are often indifferent or even hostile to the noninterventionist critique of \u201ccollective security.\u201d They drop the context of American imperialism as a system because they support institutions such as NATO and have jumped on the new cold war bandwagon.\nThey have this in common with the national security wing of the \u201cpermanent government\u201d which is avidly trying to oust Trump. The self-appointed guardians of the \u201cinternational order\u201d are not going to allow this White House to dismantle what they have spent so many years, so many tax dollars, and so many lives building up: an empire that limns the old British imperium. They simply cannot tolerate a US President who is capable of even raising the possibility of withdrawing from the Korean peninsula: that is beyond the pale as far as they are concerned.\nThat\u2019s the reason why we are seeing this unprecedented campaign against a sitting President. Trump threatens their whole system and the worldview it is based on. He is playing out his role as the Great Disruptor while the political, economic, and bureaucratic interests that are behind the sclerotic cold war era status quo look on with horror.

{"idx": "2446", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: After being invaded by Germany in the west and later by Soviet Russia in the east, the Polish government fled Warsaw but continued to fight from abroad. After Germany attacked Russia, the Russians decided to release their Polish prisoners of war, who then began re-forming into an army.\nIn April 1942, several of these Polish units landed in Persia and began a trek through a mountainous area heading toward Egypt and Palestine to re-group under the direction of the British Army.\nWhile in the mountains, the story goes that a group of soldiers happened on an Iranian shepherd boy who had found an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. (Supposedly the mother had been shot and killed.) Food was scarce, so the boy agreed to trade the cub to the soldiers for some canned meat.\nThe Polish soldiers had come from nothing, had lost everything during the war. The bear became so much more than just a mascot to them. He was a real boost to their moral.\nAt this point, Wojtek became an unofficial member of the 22nd Transport Company, Artillery Division, Polish II Corp. When the company relocated to Iraq, then Syria, Palestine and Egypt, Wojtek moved with it.\nWhile Wojtek was young, the soldiers nursed him with condensed milk placed in empty vodka bottles, then fed him fruit, honey and syrup until he was able to eat more solid foods. Knowing little about the care and feeding of bears, they eventually treated him as if he were just another solider, including giving him beer rations, which quickly became his favorite beverage. He also developed other vices over the years like smoking and eating cigarettes.\nDespite his smoking habit and seemingly a lack of proper nutrition for a bear, Wojtek grew to be a nice sized brown bear standing in at about 6 feet tall and weighing around 485 pounds. His favorite pastime was wrestling his comrades, though he also enjoyed a good game of tug of war.\nBesides these activities, Wojtek enjoyed playing with other animals. He was best friends with a Dalmatian belonging to a British liaison officer. The two animals would play and wrestle together. Not all animals were open to befriending the bear though. Wojtek at one point approached a horse in a field and was kicked in the head and neck several times. He reportedly stayed away from horses and mules after that.\nIn Palestine, Wojtek inadvertently helped capture a thief who broke into an ammunition compound. To the thief\u2019s surprise, besides ammunition, he found Wojtek, who often slept in there. Upon seeing the bear, the would-be thief made quite a commotion, which alerted the soldiers who then arrested the man. Wojtek was rewarded with a bottle of beer.\nAs the Polish Army came closer to entering the war zone in Italy in 1943, the soldiers pondered the problem of Wojtek\u2019s status, in that if he was to continue to accompany them, they\u2019d be bringing him to the front line.

Similarly, in a letter to Dr. Haseltine last week, Mr. Cooper said it did not matter whether discrimination was ''rational or irrational from a medical perspective,'' so long as it was not based on handicap.\nDr. Haseltine has carried out research on AIDS at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where he is chief of the laboratory of biochemical pharmacology. He is also an associate professor of pathology at the Harvard Medical School.\nIn a letter to Mr. Cooper on June 30, Dr. Haseltine said: ''To my knowledge, there is no evidence that transmission of the AIDS virus other than by intimate sexual contact or exchange of body fluids and/or organs has resulted in infection. What is called casual transmission such as is likely to occur in workplace settings will never pose a significant risk to uninfected co-workers.\nIn his reply, Mr. Cooper said that ''perhaps we are naive, but we are frankly surprised by the attention that has been focused upon the portion of our opinion'' discussing the transmission of AIDS.\nIn that section of the opinion, Mr. Cooper noted assurances from the Public Health Service that ''nonsexual person-to-person contact'' in the workplace did not create a risk for transmission of the AIDS virus.

According to a Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, 53 percent of Mainers oppose the ban and 41 percent support it. Six percent of voters are undecided on the issue, which has drawn significant spending by interest groups and may also be a sleeper issue in the Maine governor\u2019s race.\nThe poll of 441 likely voters has a 4.4 percent margin of error.\nWhen the newspaper asked the same question in its June poll, 48 percent of voters supported the ban, 44 percent were against it and 8 percent were undecided. The June poll also asked how familiar voters were with the issue. Thirty percent said they knew nothing about the referendum, and another 30 percent said they knew a little.\nThe new poll found that Mainers are becoming more familiar with the issue. Thirty-seven percent said they know a great deal about it and 29 percent said they know a fair amount. The number of voters who said they know nothing about the issue dropped to 8 percent, while those who know a little decreased to 25 percent.\nAccording to an analysis of the results, voters who know a great deal about the referendum continue to oppose a ban by a wide margin (65 percent to 31 percent) and those who have heard a fair amount oppose it by a smaller margin (53 percent to 39 percent).\nDemocrats slightly support the ban, 49 percent to 43 percent, while independents oppose it, 56 percent to 40 percent. Republicans oppose it 67 percent to 28 percent.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNH Survey Center, said the question could affect the gubernatorial race.

Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler may have to tread lightly.\nSmith said it might be unwise for Michaud to vocally oppose the bear-baiting ban.\nThere is some evidence that voters who wouldn\u2019t normally vote in the midterm election are motivated by the referendum.\nRachel Leichliter, 30, of Connor Township said she\u2019s largely undecided in the governor\u2019s race but leaning toward LePage because of the referendum.

As another letter writer (and last week's T&A feature) pointed out, the Alhambra in Bradford was on their schedule.\nI was particularly interested to watch the scene where they appeared at the famous (or should that be 'infamous') Glasgow Empire.

They will if the league is going to achieve a 2002 realignment during its three-day owners' meetings, anyway.\nMuch of the structure of the new eight-division, 32-team setup is in place. At least four divisions are already firmed up -- the NFC East and North, and the AFC East and West.\nLeft for the most contentious debate is which teams fill out the NFC West, AFC North and AFC South. That debate renews itself today in a Rosemont, Ill., hotel near Chicago. The key figures are the Ravens, Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals and the expansion Houston Texans, who will join the league in 2002.\nThe Ravens, Texans and Colts all want to be the fourth team in the AFC North with Cincinnati, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.\nThe Seahawks and Cardinals are headed for -- but don't want to join -- the NFC West.\nObviously, some teams will have to sacrifice for the good of the league, just as Ravens owner Art Modell did in 1969, when he agreed to shift his Cleveland Browns to the AFC with Pittsburgh and the Baltimore Colts. Wrestling with the NFL-AFL merger, the owners were deadlocked on realignment for the 1970 season.\n\"It was a tremendous sacrifice because we had great rivalries. [But] I had to break that logjam.\"\nAlthough the Browns, Colts and Steelers received $3 million apiece to relocate, Modell insists it did not influence his decision.\n\"The money was incidental,\" he said. \"The $9 million [total enticement] was on the table for four months. Anybody could've had it if they wanted to make a move.\"\nIn this realignment, one AFC team -- almost certainly the Seahawks -- will have to switch conferences. The bigger skirmish appears to be over which team will complete the AFC North.\nModell wants to stay with his old rivals, but doesn't have a vote.\nHouston's Bob McNair, who paid $700 million for his franchise and doesn't have a vote, either, wants to revive the old Oilers' rivalries in that division.\nIn all, commissioner Paul Tagliabue holds four proxy votes from expansion and relocation -- those belong to Houston, the Ravens, St. Louis and Tennessee. Passage of any plan will require 24 votes.\nThe Colts' interest in the North is for geographical reasons (Indianapolis is 90 miles from Cincinnati).\nTwo of those teams will wind up in the AFC South, instead, with the Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars. Here are two delicious new rivalries for the Titans: the Colts, with former Tennessee Vols quarterback Peyton Manning, and the Texans, who replaced the Titans in Houston. Only problem is, Tennessee doesn't want to be in the same division with Houston.\nThe league expects to eliminate several of the seven realignment proposals on the table today, then have a final vote tomorrow."}
{"idx": "2468", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Children sometimes resist taking the breaks they need. These tips can help get them to sleep smoothly.\nNovember 24, 2014, 11:22 a.m.\nAt different stages of their lives, babies, toddlers and preschoolers all need daytime sleep to help them function best. Getting adequate sleep is important for development and growth, both physical and mental.\nThe rule of thumb for naps is simple: Until about 5 months of age, babies will usually take three naps a day. Between 6 months and 18 months, they\u2019ll take two naps a day. Sometime between 18 months and 2 years (sometimes even earlier), they\u2019ll drop off to one nap a day. And somewhere between the ages of 2 and 4, kids will stop napping altogether.\nTransitioning from three to two to one to no naps isn\u2019t easy. There\u2019s usually an in-between period when children aren\u2019t really ready for a nap but are too tired without one. So what do you do if your toddler is resisting his nap? Or if you\u2019re the parent of a toddler who refuses to nap at all? Here are a few tips to help you smooth the transition to fewer naps or to help you get your toddler napping in the first place.\nIf your child knows that his afternoon nap always happens after lunch or after you read him a few books, for instance, then he\u2019ll know what to expect and will be less prone to fight you on it. In a world where very little is in their control, young kids function best when they know what to expect next and when they can be in charge of something in their own little worlds. If you stick to naptime at the same time in the same place every day, your child will come to find comfort in the routine.\nGive him some good quality stimulation and then some quiet time.\nJust after he wakes up in the morning, take your baby outside for some stimulation \u2014 run around the backyard or just take a short walk. Then, come back inside and start to wind down before naptime. Just like adults, toddlers need to slow down before they sleep. Before they take a nap, read them a couple of books, give them a warm drink or put on some soft music. Try to avoid the TV, because too much screen time can prevent them from drifting off to sleep.\nDon\u2019t miss the ideal nap window.\nWatch your toddler for signs that he is tired and ready for sleep. There are the obvious ones like yawning and rubbing of eyes, and the less obvious ones like quieting down and slowing the level of activity. Once a child is overtired (i.e., fussy and cranky), falling asleep will be much more difficult than if you hit the napping sweet spot. Usually, for very young babies, this happens about two hours after they wake up, but it can vary. Watch your child for his cues and try putting him down for a nap while he is drowsy but not overtired.\nDr. Marc Weissbluth, author of \u201cHealthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\u201d suggests temporarily making bedtime a little earlier to ensure that your child is getting enough sleep at night. Then he may only need one nap during the day as opposed to two. This also helps prevent late afternoon crankiness.\nYounger children sometimes resist taking the naps they need to get through the day. These tips can help get them to sleep smoothly."}

Exploring the state by RV is a great way to experience everything the east coast state has to offer. From the beaches of Maine's southern coast to the Maine Highlands, there's something for campers of all ages to enjoy in the state known as \"Vactionland.\"\nThe best times to go RVing in Maine is during fall, spring and summer, when temperatures are comfortable and driving is not inhibited by snow or icy conditions. Most Maine RV parks are open from Memorial Day to Columbus Day. Many campgrounds, like Halley's Point in Bar Harbor, offer discounted rates in the \"off-season,\" or fall. If you leave early enough in the fall you can catch the wonderful Maine foliage while river and lake waters are still ripe for fishing and swimming.\nRV parks near Maine's coast provides campers with the unique opportunity to access the state's numerous Atlantic beaches while maintaining access to freshwater lakes and streams. The Paradise Park Resort, for example, boasts a freshwater pond for paddle boating, but is still located in close proximity to Old Orchard Beach, the largest and most popular beach in Maine. Old Orchard is home to some of Maine's best ocean swimming as well as a water park, amusement park and arcade games.\nSeveral RV parks are located in the northern Maine region known as the Highlands. Mountain biking, river kayaking and canoeing are popular activities at Baxter State Park. Great hiking for campers of all ages is available at parks like Peaks-Kenny State Park, where slowing ascending trails lead to sprawling views of the surrounding wilderness atop Bible Point.\nHunting and fishing are staples of the Maine wilderness. In most areas, visitors are required to have hunting and fishing licenses. Licenses are required for fishing in inland waters or transporting fish taken from inland waters, while hunting permits are required for hunting of all kinds. White-tailed Deer are popular in the Aroostook Region while waterfowl and ruffed grouse are common game in the Penobscot area.\nMany Maine RV parks are small and customarily filled to capacity during the busy season.

Financial Turbulence on a World Scale?\nAfter the victory of the \u201cBrexit\u201d in the June 23 referendum, the world economy entered into an episode of turbulence: billions of US dollars disappeared from the principal markets in hours, with which the risks of a new banking crisis in Europe increased. According to Ariel Noyola Rodriguez , the rapid unraveling of the project of European Unity is highly improbable, even though in various countries there has been a call to leave the European Union, the majority of nations of continental Europe form part of the Eurozone and until now, with the exception of political parties of the extreme right, there are no political forces disposed to abandon the common currency.\nAlthough the principal surveys published over several weeks indicated that the British were convinced of their permanence in the European Union, the group in favour of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d) finally won in the referendum celebrated on June 23 with a margin of nearly four points: 51.9% voted in favour with 48.1% against.\nSurprisingly the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced his resignation moments after; the Pound Sterling registered its worst value since 1985; and the major stock markets collapsed. Both in the Asia-Pacific region as in the European Continent the markets fell between 6 and 10%. In fact, the imminent withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union opened a new picture of great uncertainty at a moment of extreme vulnerability for the world economy.\nAt the beginning of June, the World Bank reduced their prevision of growth for 2016 from 2.9 to 2.4%; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for their part noted that economic nationalism can undermine the free movement of commercial exchange and investment among countries; so that the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) is looking closely at the risks of a new \u201ccurrency war\u201d.\nThe fact is that international monetary cooperation is facing one of its major challenges and because of this, with the danger that credit markets may shrink from one moment to another, the European Central Bank (ECB) under Mario Draghi, and the Bank of England under Mark Carney joined the fray to make it clear that they would spare no resources to guarantee financial stability.\nOver the long day, but above all after the first signs that the \u201cBrexit\u201d had triumphed in the ballots, the ECB intervened violently in the sovereign debt market to avoid an increase in \u201crisk premiums\u201d of the bonds of the peripheral economies: Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal, etc. Meanwhile, the Bank of England had already prepared a powerful battery of 250 billion Pounds Sterling to defend their exchange in the face of attacks by speculators.\nThe Federal Reserve System (FED), under the mandate of Janet Yellen, established a series of \u201cswaps\u201d to provide additional liquidity along with other central banks of the Group of 7 (G-7, made up of Germany, Canada ,the United States, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom) in case the volatility of financial markets went out of control.\nBut the contingency plans of the monetary authorities were not sufficient. World stock markets registered losses of more than 2 trillion US dollars in less than 24 hours. It should be noted in addition that the chaos of the Pound Sterling occasioned a massive flight of capital from the London Stock Market, to immediately take refuge in Wall Street."}

{"idx": "2481", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Windows 7 has the potential to become a security target in 2010, according to researchers, although it's held up so far.\nJust days after Windows 7 was released to OEMs and partners in July, a serious vulnerability was reported in the operating system. However, Microsoft released an early patch, and no serious issues were reported in 2009.\n\"Many vulnerabilities did not affect Windows 7 itself but actually affected the release candidate of Windows 7,\" said Jason Miller, security and data team manager at Shavlik Technologies.\nWhile Microsoft has already issued the first security patches for the new operating system, expect more vulnerabilities to come, according to Zulfikar Ramzan, a technical director and architect with Symantec Security Response.\n\"As long as humans are programming computer code, flaws will be introduced, no matter how thorough pre-release testing is,\" Ramzan said in an e-mail discussing Symantec's recent trends and predictions report. \"And the more complex the code, the more likely that undiscovered vulnerabilities exist. Microsoft's new operating system is no exception, and as Windows 7 hits the pavement and gains traction in 2010, attackers will undoubtedly find ways to exploit its users.\"\nMicrosoft initiated its security development lifecycle (SDL) process as company-wide policy for developing its software in 2004. The policy likely has reduced vulnerabilities in software such as Windows 7, even though 2009 saw a record number of vulnerabilities in older Windows products -- approximately 80 bugs in all, including the infamous Conficker worm.\nSDL essentially is a framework for building security into Microsoft's software. Results from its use appear to be good so far.\n\"If Microsoft's metrics are to be believed -- and I do believe them -- then yes [SDL has been a success],\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education at ESET. \"The number of critical vulnerabilities found in the products under the SDL has dropped dramatically. The issue going forward is that critics will point out the vulnerabilities that make it through without the recognition of how many more vulnerabilities didn't make it through.\"\nAll software vendors face the challenge of responding to zero-day exploits. Much will depend on whether security experts choose to contact Microsoft privately about their discoveries or go public.\n\"I recall a time [in 2009] when a panic was created around a vulnerability in Windows 7 before Microsoft had a chance to research and disclose the actual information around the vulnerability, causing deserved embarrassment for the researcher,\" Miller said. He added that such a jump-the-gun culture among some vendors doesn't help anybody -- not Microsoft, not researchers and definitely not users.\nGoing public may force Microsoft to become more responsive, but the importance of a bug can be a subjective call.\n\"Generally Microsoft is responsive to bug reports,\" Abrams said. \"But there are cases when the nature of the bug is not adequately understood and it may be dismissed as far less of a problem than it really is.\"\nFor his part, Abrams suggests that Microsoft and vendors should play nicer this year.\n\"Both security vendors and independent researchers should report responsibly [to Microsoft],\" Abrams said. \"That said, the affected vendor, whether it is Microsoft or another company, needs to be responsive and transparently explain if a fix will take longer than seems to be reasonable.\""}

Protein also contributes to muscle growth, tissue repair, immune health, hormone production and enzyme synthesis. A wide variety of foods supply either protein or carbohydrates, while some offer both. Including them in a well-balanced diet promotes optimal health by giving you these nutrients as well as essential fats, vitamins and minerals.\nAnimal-based foods are one of the richest sources of protein you can consume. They are particularly beneficial because they are nutritionally complete proteins, meaning it provides the essential amino acids your body can\u2019t produce and must receive from your diet. These protein sources also furnish additional nutrients. Red meat, for example, gives you iron, while fish supplies heart-healthy fats. Milk and milk products offer calcium, and these foods are also a source of carbohydrate due to their lactose, or milk sugar, content. Other animal sources of protein include poultry and eggs.\nLegumes \u2013 peas, dry beans, peanuts and lentils, for instance \u2013 contribute both protein and carbohydrates to your meal plan. Because their protein content does not include all essential amino acids, they are considered to be lower quality than the protein from animal sources. However, combining complementary sources of these incomplete proteins, such as legumes with whole grains, provides you with the full range of essential amino acids. Legumes are a rich source of carbohydrates with a low glycemic index. These types of carbohydrates are a healthy addition to your diet because they don\u2019t cause a drastic spike in your blood sugar when you eat them.\nWhole grains supply you with significant carbohydrates along with a smaller amount of protein. Similar to legumes, the protein in grains is nutritionally incomplete, but consuming rice, barley, whole wheat or oats, for example, with legumes creates a high-quality protein to support your cells and tissues. Also similar to legumes, whole grains are a source of healthy, low-glycemic index carbohydrates. In addition, these foods contribute dietary fiber that promotes digestive health.\nNuts and seeds are another source of both protein and carbohydrates. Walnuts, pecans, almonds, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds contribute lower-quality protein that, in combination with either legumes or whole grains, offer a complete protein. Nuts and seeds also add carbohydrates and unsaturated fats to your diet. Some fruits and vegetables, especially the ones containing seeds you eat, supply limited amounts of protein, but their primary contribution is dietary carbohydrates in the form of sugars and starches. Apples, bananas, oranges and carrots are examples of foods that exhibit a low glycemic index that can help modulate your blood sugar. Fruits and vegetables also contribute vitamins, minerals and fiber to your diet.\nAnnigan, Jan. \"What Are Good Sources of Protein & Carbohydrates?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/good-sources-protein-carbohydrates-7463.html. 20 December 2018."}

{"idx": "2486", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Justice League Dark Animated Film On The Way?\nWhile most of the attention as of late has been directed toward DC's tumultuous live-action extended film universe and its ever-growing line-up of superheroic TV dramas, one shouldn't forget about the equally robust world of direct-to-video animated films based on the company's comic book properties. The current focus of DC's animated movie arm is Sam Liu and Bruce Timm's upcoming adaptation of the classic Alan Moore graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, which features the return of iconic voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to the roles of Batman and The Joker, and is also the first animated DC project to receive an R rating from the MPAA.\nFans have wondered whether The Killing Joke would signal a darker direction for the DC animated film universe going forward, and a new bit of info suggests that a darker path is indeed where things are headed. As first noticed by an eagle eyed Redditor named Andyporras, the BBFC has recently approved and classified something called A Sneak Peak [sic] at Justice League Dark, which will seemingly be a near 8-minute video preview that appears as an extra feature on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of Killing Joke. Odd spelling error aside, this classification by the BBFC serves to effectively confirm that a Justice League Dark film is next on the animated DC film slate, despite no prior mention of such a project's existence by either DC or Warner Bros.\nFor those unfamiliar, Justice League Dark was a monthly comic book series that ran from November 2011 to March 2015, and featured a team of DC's more supernaturally inclined heroes that handled bizarre situations not exactly tailored for folks like Superman or The Flash. The Justice League Dark roster changed occasionally as time went on, although a few of the more prominent members included John Constantine, Swamp Thing, Zatanna, Madame Xanadu, and Frankenstein's Monster.\nThe arrival of Justice League Dark to the film landscape will be the culmination of a fairly long journey, as writer/director Guillermo Del Toro had been trying to get a live-action movie adaptation of the series off the ground since 2012, only to see his project continue to end up back in development hell. Presumably due in part to the endless delays, Del Toro eventually abandoned the film in 2015, although DC and Warner Bros. maintain that it's still coming regardless.\nAt least some members of Justice League Dark were also planned to make an appearance on the recent Constantine TV series starring Matt Ryan, but NBC saw fit to cancel the show before those plans could come to fruition. While animation and live-action are certainly too very different branches of filmmaking, at least it looks like readers will finally get to see Justice League Dark hop out of the comic pages and onto their TV sets. With that said, one wonders how long it'll take fans to create a petition urging DC and WB to bring in Ryan as the voice of Constantine.\nThe existence of a Justice League Dark animated movie has yet to be officially confirmed, but we'll keep you updated on any further news."}

South Dakota Mines (2-7, 0-2 RMAC) countered with a 13-2 spurt of its own, with eight of those points coming off the hot shooting hand of Troy Brady, who connected on a pair of 3-pointers, the second of which pulled the Hardrockers even at 25-25.\nSenior guard Wade Miller quickly put Dixie State back on top with three free throws after he was fouled on a 3-point attempt. Then after an SDM score, Miller drilled connected from downtown to put the Blazers back up 31-27 before DSU settled for a 33-31 halftime advantage.\nDixie State pushed its lead to as many as nine points on a couple of occasions in the second frame and enjoyed a 62-53 advantage following a pair of Price free throws with 6:09 remaining. However, the Blazers could not deliver the knockout blow as the Hardrockers managed to make it a one-possession game again after a Damini Hayes lay-in and free throw pulled SDM to within three at 65-62 with 2:44 left.\nPrice made it a two-possession game after a transition bucket with just less than two minutes to play.

Well, here's a brief rundown. Early Monday morning, MarineMax issued a \"fiscal 2007 update\" -- a.k.a. an \"earnings warning.\" Citing \"increased softness\" in the boating industry, CEO William McGill knocked a good 31% off of his firm's previous earnings estimates for this year, predicting same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits and an earnings range that centers on about $1.45 per share.\nAlthough they're not as good as we had been led to believe, those numbers actually don't look too bad.

One possibility: MarineMax said it expected same-store sales growth of 14% this first quarter of 2007. To get to mid-single digits over the course of the year, MarineMax's business is going to have to slow down an awful lot. Thus, McGill appears to be saying things will get a lot worse before they get any better.

Such a planet must have an enormous atmosphere that converts the deadly X-rays and high-energy particles of the pulsar into heat.\nAlthough pulsars regularly blast out deadly gamma rays and X-rays, alien planets in orbit around them could theoretically be habitable, a new study finds.\nHowever, these pulsar worlds are likely not friendly to humans \u2014 according to the study, the planets' environment would be more like the bottom of the sea on Earth.\nPulsars rotate extraordinarily rapidly, up to thousands of revolutions per second, and they flash like lighthouse beacons \u2014 hence their name, which is short for \"pulsating star.\" They regularly blaze with gamma rays and X-rays and spew out energetic particles. According to the new study's researchers, the Milky Way galaxy hosts about 1 billion neutron stars, about 200,000 of which are pulsars.\nDespite the violent nature of pulsars, they can still have planets. In fact, the first exoplanets that astronomers discovered orbit the pulsar B1257+12, located about 2,300 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo.\nThree worlds are known to orbit B1257+12, one of which is about one-fiftieth Earth's mass, while the other two are \"super-Earths\" about four times Earth's mass. Since these three exoplanets were discovered in 1992, astronomers have also discovered one Jupiter-size world around the pulsar PSR J1719\u20131438 and another Jupiter-size world around PSR B1620-26, which is a binary system containing a pulsar and a white dwarf star.\nNow researchers suggest that life could exist on those pulsar-orbiting planets. \"Despite emitting deadly particles and radiation, pulsars might have an habitable zone,\" study co-author Alessandro Patruno, an astrophysicist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told Space.com.\nSince there is life virtually wherever there is water on Earth, astronomers often judge a world as potentially habitable if it exists in a zone where liquid water could survive on its surface. In the new study, researchers found \"habitable zones\" could exist around neutron stars.\n\"Such a habitable zone can be as wide as the one that exists around normal stars,\" study co-author Mihkel Kama, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge in England, told Space.com.\nThe researchers noted the habitability of planets around pulsars depended on at least two key findings. For one, atmospheres a million times thicker than Earth's are likely needed to protect any life on their surfaces from pulsar radiation. This would make conditions on these worlds similar to ones found in Earth's deep seas.\n\"The atmospheric pressure you find on the surface of these planets is comparable to or even higher than the pressure you have in the Mariana Trench,\" which at 36,000 feet deep (11,000 meters) is the deepest known point on Earth's surface, Kama said.\n\"However, since we know that life exists in the depths of our ocean, some form of life might certainly exist in these high pressure and warm environments,\" Patruno said.\nAnother key finding was that habitable worlds around pulsars are likely super-Earths with masses up to 10 times"}

The companies are knitting together hardware and software to work more cohesively in a system, and also establishing hypervisors, secure boot layers, and segmented areas - much like sandboxes - in which code could be executed without compromising a system.\nMost mobile device users are not tech savvy, and haven't secured devices with passwords or pins. Few devices have security software to prevent malware, and trojans running on social networking apps could collect personal information and send it back to rogue servers, he said.\nARM is improving its security layer called TrustZone to prevent such attacks, Chandra said. The layer establishes a trusted execution environment in which code can be safely executed without affecting the entire system.\nThe company also wants to eliminate users from having to use multifactor authentication and entering multiple passwords, Chandra said, adding that there are more secure ways to log-in to websites.\nHe gave the example of the FIDO authenticator, in which users can login through fingerprint scanning or face recognition. The log-in generates a private key that is encrypted, sent to a FIDO server, which then decrypts the key. That emerging technology works within TrustZone, which protects private keys.\nThe form of authentication is being promoted by the FIDO Alliance, which was established early last year and boasts members such as ARM, Google, Microsoft, Bank of America, MasterCard, PayPal, Samsung, Visa, Lenovo and others.\nIt's also important to make sure servers are ready to deal with different security layers in mobile devices and the new authentication techniques, said Ruby Lee, professor of electrical engineering at Princeton University.\n\"Security is not only a top to bottom issue.

But there is still a long way to go before North African schools match international best practice, or even Middle East and North Africa (Mena) averages, and the shortcomings are widely acknowledged.\nAn executive opinion survey run by the World Economic Forum (WEF), for example, puts most of the region towards the bottom of global league tables when it comes to the quality of education. Out of 144 countries surveyed, Algeria is ranked in 131st place, Egypt in 139th and Libya in 142nd. Morocco is best-placed at 104th (Tunisia and Sudan are not covered by the survey).\nThe poor performance of the education systems can be clearly seen in the low literacy rates. Despite its relatively high standing in the WEF rankings, the worst country in this respect is Morocco, with a literacy rate of just 56 per cent for those aged 15 or older, with 69 per cent of men and just 44 per cent of women able to meet basic standards of reading and writing.\nMauritania does not fare much better, with a literacy rate of under 58 per cent. Sudan, Egypt and Algeria all have a rate of 71-73 per cent, with Tunisia slightly higher at 78 per cent and Libya the clear leader in the field, with a literacy rate of 89 per cent.\nAcross North Africa, women are far less likely to have basic literacy skills, although the Libyan female literacy rate of 83 per cent is higher than the national rate for any other country. Libya has the advantage of great oil wealth and a smaller population than all of its neighbours, with the exception of Mauritania. That wealth means it can afford to have almost as many teachers as Morocco, a country with more than five times as many students. Under former leader Muammar Gaddafi, the country was also planning a massive university building programme that would have seen at least 25 new or enlarged institutions constructed at a cost of $3bn-5bn.\nInvestment projects in Libya remain in a state of flux, but even if those particular plans are not revived, the potential is there for large-scale investment in education in the future \u0096 a luxury that other countries in North Africa do not have. However, as Libya\u0092s poor rankings in the WEF survey show, good education is not simply a matter of how much money is spent.\nLibya actually has the lowest level of education spending relative to gross domestic product (GDP), at 2.7 per cent, of any country"}

You open the door of your fridge and the light goes on, right? What if the light in your fridge could stay on and be programmed to help your veggies taste better or be more nutritious? Why? Well, it turns out that that head of cabbage on your grocery shelf isn't just sitting there as long as it's not too far after harvesting. Researchers have found that it can still respond to daily cycles of light and darkness and build up its own circadian rhythms, changing its biochemistry to adapt to the daily cycles.\nWhy is that important? Joining me now is Janet Braam. She is chair and professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice University in Houston and one of the authors of a paper published this week on this research in the journal Current Biology. Welcome to the program.\nDR. JANET BRAAM: Thank you.\nFLATOW: So our veggies are sitting there in the supermarket, and they're doing what?\nBRAAM: Well, they are still alive. They are still responding to external stimuli. What we've shown is perhaps surprisingly, they can respond to light-dark cycles and really change their metabolite accumulation to different times of day.\nFLATOW: They change their metabolism as the sort of a circadian rhythm for my cabbage?\nBRAAM: Right, right. So when the crops are growing in the field, they respond to the light-dark cycles, and they - all plants have a circadian rhythm, so they have patterns of behavior that they control or they - that are under the influence of their circadian clock. And when you harvest vegetables and fruits, these vegetables and fruits really stay very much alive even though they've been removed from the whole plant. But then when we store them under constant conditions like in constant light in the grocery store, their circadian rhythms begin to dampen. And so then they lose the ability to show these rhythmic behaviors.\nFLATOW: And when they're doing the rhythmic behaviors, there's got to be a good reason why they're in a behavior; they're doing something.\nBRAAM: Right. We know from basic plant biology research that plants have these circadian clocks, and we know that they use them in part to respond or to prepare for seasonal changes. But in addition, we recently found that these circadian clocks are also very important for plant defense against insect attack. So plants are able to turn on their defenses at a time when insects are most likely to seed. So in that way, they can prepare for attack before it actually happens. And this is clearly advantageous. Plants are much more resistant to insects if their clocks are functioning properly.\nFLATOW: And when they get - when you put them under the 24"}

She entered a guilty plea and, as I am not a proponent of California's ridiculous capital punishment system, will receive, in my opinion, the maximum and appropriate punishment.\nOne remaining item concerns me: the judge's refusal to lift the gag order. The initial gag order had merit, to ensure the jury was not tainted, to guarantee a fair and impartial trial and to protect the privacy of the Cantu family. Now following a guilty plea, everything but the privacy issue is no longer relevant.\nAs a free democracy it is our constitutional right to be informed if and how our judicial system is working. This far outweighs the privacy issue. One of the most vital aspects of a successful democracy is transparency.

Yale\u2019s head coach Kylie Stannard and the head coach of Hartford Athletic, Jimmy Nielsen, joined Downs as he signed his first professional contract. The Connecticut native will now represent his home state as Hartford embarks on its inaugural season. This is the first time a Yale men\u2019s soccer player has gone professional in 14 years and exemplifies the rise of the Yale men\u2019s soccer program.\nLed by Nielson, Hartford Athletic is the newest team in the USL, the second division of American professional soccer. In the press conference, Nielsen noted that when he first took the head coaching position at Hartford in August, he was asked if he would take any local players. While it was a goal for Nielsen, it was not a necessity, and he insisted he would only take local players if they were good enough. Downs proved that he fit the bill.\nIn fact, Downs is the only local player on the squad so far. Nielsen \u2014 who played in England, Major League Soccer and his native Denmark \u2014 has already signed seven players from outside the US, including four from Denmark.\nAt the conference, Downs was lauded for his numerous accomplishments, work ethic and character. Raised in Lakeville, CT, Downs studied and played soccer at the Hotchkiss School before taking his athletic and academic talents to Yale. During his time at Hotchkiss, Downs volunteered for the Right to Dream Academy, a soccer academy that educates and trains talented young players from West Africa. Downs himself took three trips to Ghana to help in the classroom and on the field.\nAt Yale, Downs continued to develop himself as a player, student and citizen. A three-year All-Ivy recipient, Downs was named to the first team this year. In his senior season, Downs started all 16 games. He finished his career with 65 total appearances for the Elis, posting nine goals, 15 assists and 33 points.\nThis year, Downs helped lead the team to their first winning season since 2011, and all four of Downs\u2019 years have seen increasing total team wins. He has been named to several regional and local honor teams, including the United Soccer Coaches All-Northeast Region Third Team and the Google Cloud Academic All-District First Team.\nIn the classroom, Downs is an economics major with an impressive 3.8 grade-point average.\nAt the end of the press conference, Downs, Stannard and Nielsen all thanked Downs\u2019 teammates for their support and role in shaping Downs as a player. In addition to praising Downs for his success, Stannard took the time to acknowledge his hopes for the soccer program in the future: a professional signing every year moving forward.\nDowns will start training with the team in less than two weeks before the season opener on March 9.\nCate Sawkins | cate.sawkins@yale.edu ."}

They securitized a greater portion of debt to pass the home loans onto investors and their stock prices correlated more closely to the downturn and ensuing bailout.\nThe banks\u2019 loans also suffered from higher delinquencies during the downturn.\nWhat the economists could not determine definitively was the banks\u2019 motivation for lobbying. If banks were looking to generate income at society\u2019s expense, then it would make sense to curtail their lobbying.\nIf banks were concerned mainly about short-term profit and not thinking about the long-term consequences, then executive compensation practices should be changed, the report said. And if banks just wanted to inform lawmakers, and were overoptimistic about their prospects, it would be more difficult to suggest reforms.\nWhen the bubble burst, banks that spent more on lobbying received \u201ca bigger piece of the cake\u201d from the $700 billion bailout in the fall of 2008.\nAs examples, the report cites Citigroup Inc (C.N) spending $3 million to lobby against the HR-1051 Predatory Lending Consumer Protection Act of 2001 as well as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) spending $1 million to lobby on banking and housing issues.\nHR-1051 was never signed into law, nor were 93 percent of all bills promoting tighter regulation from 1999 through 2006. However, two bills that significantly reduced restrictions in the mortgage market became law, the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 and the American Dream Downpayment Act of 2003.\nCitigroup and Bank of America each eventually received $45 billion worth of bailout funds, more than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) or other large commercial banks.\nNow that the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill has passed, big banks have been lobbying aggressively against restrictions they believe are too harsh. Among the top items on the industry\u2019s lobbying agenda are stronger capital regulations, as well as a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, new rules on derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading.\nOn Tuesday, the House Financial Services Committee voted to delay implementation of derivatives reform for 18 months. Although few expect any such measure to clear the Senate or be signed by the president, some executives on Wall Street are pressing for slower rulemaking.\nThe economists\u2019 report outlined the negative impacts of bank lobbying, but Igan said that this time around, Wall Street\u2019s interests may be aligned with the broader economy \u2014 if only by happenstance.\nShe"}

And they both prefer similar habitat and similar food \u2014 hard structures likely to hold crabs and shellfish.\nOf course, both species are around the rest of the year, too, but they become abundant in winter in northwest Florida. Particularly in the case of the sheepshead, they tend to aggregate in large schools as they prepare for the spawn in early spring.\nCatch one sheepy at this time of year, and you may load up with a limit of eight \u2014 note that\u2019s down from the 15 that were allowed a few years back. The size limit is still 12 inches. Black drum have a slot limit, 14 to 24 inches, and the bag is five daily.\nFinding the fish is a matter of running from one piece of hard structure to another until you connect. In clearer water near the passes, it\u2019s often possible to see sheepshead as they graze on barnacles on bridge and dock pilings. The same is true at the large piers extending into the Gulf when the surf is moderate.\nThey also gather in the black water of inside bayous around deeper docks and bridges, but can\u2019t be seen here. The docks along the ICW from Destin to Fort Walton Beach are known as particularly productive. And of course the jetties are always worth checking at all Panhandle passes.\nFor those who take time to scout out wrecks and rock piles in the deeper water of the large bays, these locations also produce exceptionally well, and get less pressure than more obvious spots. Both sheepshead and black drum also gather in oystery holes in the deep back-country creeks like those at the east end of Choctawhatchee Bay.\nThe basic tactic is to fish a thumbnail-sized piece of fresh-cut shrimp on a size 1 J-style hook with enough weight to get it to bottom. Other baits that work well are sand fleas, fiddler crabs, oysters and barnacles, but none of these stay on the hook as well or are as readily available as shrimp.\nMany anglers like to rig with a 12-inch dropper above the weight, so that they can feel the bite without the fish having to move the lead. Braided 15-pound-test on a 7-foot medium spinning rig and 3000-size reel is a good rig. Many prefer fluorocarbon leader in 15 to 20 pound test, because it\u2019s a harder line than mono and less likely to get nipped by the sharp teeth of the sheepshead, though if the \u2018head makes a direct bite on fluoro that gets cut, too.\nIt can be tricky to hook sheepshead because of their relatively small and very hard mouths, designed to grind up shellfish. What works best is to keep tension on the line and when you feel the bait pulled or moved steadily, make a slow, firm pull, then start reeling immediately without allowing any slack. A sharp snap-set often jerks the hook out of the fish\u2019s mouth. Black drum, on the other hand, usually hook themselves \u2014 the same steady hook set works fine for them.\nWhile it\u2019s possible to catch some of each species by simply dropping a line around hard structure, it\u2019s much more effective to chum."}

Tina Tchen, upon urgings by the Smollett family, asked Foxx to help the actor\u2019s case.\nNow the Chicago Police Union is calling Foxx\u2019s conduct during the investigation \u201chighly suspicious.\u201d They have also called the federal government to investigate her conduct on the case.\nInvestigators have text message exchanges between Foxx, Tchen, and a relative of the shamed actor.\nAlthough the Smollett relative has not been named, it has been shown that his sisters see to have close ties with the former aide, Tchen.\nTchen and Smollett\u2019s sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, were captured in a photograph attending an event at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.\nIt has also been noted that both of Smollett\u2019s sisters worked for the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012.

He also once danced on stage with Michelle Obama, in a video that had gone viral from an event last year. However, this was all before Smollett created a hoax to stage a hate crime committed against himself.\nAs the facts come out, it appears that the Smollett family first contacted Tchen and asked her to help them with the case. Tchen then texted State\u2019s Attorney Foxx asking her to get the case elevated to the FBI. Foxx tried to comply with the former White House aide\u2019s wishes, and contacted Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson and ask him to let the FBI take on the case. But Superintendent Johnson refused to let that happened.\nFoxx then reported back to Tchen that she had tried to do it.

In May, it was widely reported that Davis's identity had been stolen at least 13 times. The controversy over LifeLock's advertising ultimately cost the company $12 million in fines.\nGranted, most of us won't plaster our Social Security numbers all over billboards. But real threats exist out there, and it is important to protect your identity. Are online identity-protection services worth the cost? Can you trust them? Are there more-effective ways to protect your personal information without the services of a specialized company? We did some digging, and here\u2019s what we found.\nCriminals can steal your identity through a variety of ways, including phishing scams, malware on your PC, and even rooting through your trash for sensitive paper documents. You can defend yourself against such attacks by keeping an eye out for phishing tactics, running antimalware utilities, and shredding documents.\nOne method of identity theft that you can't directly guard against is a data breach against a company--such as a bank--that you do business with. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, 498 such breaches occurred in 2009. Often criminals will sell personal information harvested from data breaches to other crooks on online black markets. Criminals could use your identity for anything from opening bank or credit card accounts to seeking medical care using your name.\nTo make matters worse, laws requiring companies to disclose data breaches are spotty: Some states have tough reporting laws, but no national standard exists. In other words, you could do everything right, and still have your identity stolen without realizing it. No wonder there's a market for identity-theft protection services.\nIdentity-theft protection services typically monitor your credit or public records for any suspicious charges, or offer other identity-theft safeguards, for a monthly fee. In some cases they provide services to help clean up the mess left behind in the wake of identity theft and assist in rebuilding your credit. Banks frequently offer several degrees of identity-theft protection to their customers, as well.\nYou won't find any hard and fast guidelines about what to look for if you decide to buy into an identity-theft protection service. \"Consumers need to do their homework,\" says Jay Foley, executive director with the Identity Theft Resource Center. Before signing up, you should ask what these companies offer, and evaluate whether their services fit your needs.\nAccording to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, identity-theft protection services don't monitor certain types of identity theft, such as prior instances of identity theft, Social Security number fraud (a point of contention with the LifeLock advertising), debit/check card fraud, criminal identity fraud (that is, a criminal assumes your identity when arrested), and medical fraud (a criminal assumes your identity when seeking medical attention). Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearninghouse, notes that these sorts of crimes \"are more difficult to recover from than financial identity theft.\"\nPrivacy Rights Clearninghouse provides a list of the sorts of services you should look for in an ID-theft protection service. In particular, you should determine what sorts of credit-monitoring services the company provides (which credit bureaus it gets reports from, how often it obtains reports, whether you can have unlimited access to your credit reports and scores), whether the company provides services you can't do by yourself or find elsewhere, and what"}

Here are a few tips to help you out.\nCardio is something we need to do in order to lose weight but it\u2019s something almost everyone hates. It tends to be boring and long and for people living a fast-paced life, this is not the best way to exercise. High intensity interval training ( HIIT for short) is one of the most effective ways to do cardio.

Sticking in the 5-8 rep range is considered to be the best as this puts your muscles under more strain the weights that will allow you to do 10 \u2013 12 reps. However, you need to be careful and know your limit when doing this as the heavier you go the more dangerous it can become.\nThis is one of the most important things you can do but most people ignore it. Over time our bodies get used to the exercises we do and they tend to decrease the effectiveness. Because of this, it\u2019s important that you change your work out from time to time. Six weeks is a good interval for you. You can repeat some exercises but try to change the majority as this will challenge your body more. On the other hand, it can also make things fresh and interesting.\nNo matter how much you work out the food you eat can have a huge impact on your health and wellbeing and you need to make sure that you look into these things.

I spend a lot of time in my car each week and was wondering if I can apply feng shui principles to my car; or, is feng shui only for the home?\nFeng shui principles can apply to any environment we spend time in, including your car. Between commuting, shopping, family activities, appointments and other scheduled events, we spend a lot of time in our cars, which are connected to us energetically, so taking care of them can ensure maximum energetic support when we are away from home.\n1. Wash your car regularly. A dirty car rejects positive energy, while a clean car draws positive energy to you.\n2. Keep your car\u2019s interior free of clutter and rubbish. The negative impact of clutter and rubbish is intensified by the small interior space of a car. Old papers, wrappers, bottles, cans and unpleasant smells create chaotic and stuck energy. By removing these things from the seats, floor, glove compartment, trunk and any other storage areas, you symbolically free the path to move forward smoothly in your life and career.\n3. Name your car. Giving your car a name is a sure way to form a strong connection to it. When you create a connection to your car by \u201cpersonifying\u201d it, you will naturally take better care of it. Using decals or vanity plates can also foster that personal connection.\n4. Add something meaningful. Using symbols promotes sensory well-being. The symbol need not be seen and can be anything: a special stone that reminds you to take care of your health, a smile-enhancer in the form of a photo of your pet or child, or a favorite charm. You can place these symbols in your coin holder, glove compartment, or by hanging them on your rearview mirror.\nIn feng shui, every color has certain attributes and energetic characteristics based on the five elements. If you are purchasing a car, consider choosing the color based on the elemental energy you would like to have more of in your life. If you already have a car, read the color symbolism below to see what energy your car embodies and how it serves you.\nFire \u2014 Red, orange, purple, burgundy and coral represent expressiveness, inspiration, brightness, wealth, abundance and power.\nEarth \u2014 Earthly colors such as brown, yellow, beige, and sandstone bring the energy of reliability, patience, nurturing, grounding, stability and balance into your life.\nMetal \u2014 White, silver, gold, bronze, copper and other metallic colors bring clarity, logic, perfection, intelligence, strength, resilience, organization and focus into your life.\nWater \u2014 Navy blue, black, charcoal and gray represent wisdom, flow, relaxation, creativity and comfort.\nWood \u2014 Green, teal, olive and medium blue bring the energy of growth, expansion, strength, vitality, flexibility and generosity into your life.\nEverything is connected and symbolism is in everything. For example, when I see clutter in the environment, I know the inhabitants have \u201cclutter\u201d in the mind or in the form of accumulated weight on the body or feel tired or held back in life. Consider the following symbolism when maintaining your car.\nEngine: Career and life path. Keep your engine in shape to give drive to your career.\nGas tank: Wealth and abundance.\nTo avoid feelings of \u201crunning on empty,\u201d fill your gas tank as soon as you notice that it is low.\nRearview mirror: Wisdom.

With an assist from Stanley Newman, sitting in between us, it fit exactly and David and I agreed to collaborate, with Stanley bowing out. David filled the grid, I wrote a first pass on the clues and we bounced the clues back and forth until we reached consensus.

{"idx": "2559", "prompt": "Continue the following text: This article originally appeared on Real Clear Markets on March 7, 2017.\nAutomatic payroll withholding to help workers save for retirement should be a no-brainer. Both conservatives and liberals worry that Social Security will lack funds to pay for promised benefits after 2030. At the same time, about one-third of workers are \u201cnot too confident\u201d or \u201cnot at all confident\u201d they will have enough money to live comfortably when they retire. Under these circumstances it seems sensible to make it as easy as possible for workers to save for retirement in the workplace. Twelve years ago George W. Bush proposed giving workers the option of placing up to 4% of their wages or $1,000 in private retirement accounts. (The funds would have come from workers\u2019 Social Security contributions.) Oddly, however, most conservative lawmakers are opposed to practical steps to put retirement savings plans in every workplace. This position seems puzzling in view of conservatives\u2019 opposition to raising taxes to pay for future Social Security pensions. If Social Security benefits must be trimmed to keep the system solvent, it makes sense to offer all workers, including those without a company pension plan, a simple way to accumulate private retirement savings.\nAt the moment a sizeable fraction of employees works for companies that do not offer a 401(k) or any other kind of retirement plan. The exact percentage of workers who lack access to a plan depends on the category of employee and the source of statistics. Full-time workers between ages 21 and 64 are more likely to be offered a retirement plan compared with part-time employees, teens, and older workers. Even in the favored group of full-time, prime-age workers, about one-quarter are not offered a savings plan at their place of work. The statistics for workers in small firms are much worse. Only about half of workers in companies with fewer than 100 employees is offered a retirement savings plan.\nAmong employees who are offered a retirement plan, the take-up rate is very high for workers employed in both large and small companies. In many private retirement plans, of course, workers are enrolled in the plan whether or not they choose to participate. Employers make contributions into the plan for all the workers they hire, perhaps after a brief waiting period. Even in plans where workers must elect to participate by making voluntary contributions, however, enrollment rates tend to be very high. Participation rates in voluntary savings plans can be boosted still further if workers are automatically enrolled as soon as they\u2019re put on a company\u2019s payroll. Employees in these \u201copt-out\u201d plans can affirmatively elect to drop out of the savings plan, but experience shows that relatively few make this choice.\nPlainly, most workers recognize the need to set aside part of their pay for retirement, especially when their employer fails to offer a traditional pension. When enrollment in a retirement plan is simple and when savings are automatically subtracted from wages in each pay period, the great majority of prime-age workers will accumulate retirement savings. Even if many end up saving too little, all will have the opportunity of saving something. Most will accumulate more than would be the case if they were forced to save outside of a workplace plan.\nIf Social Security benefits must be trimmed to keep the system solvent, it makes sense to offer all workers, including those without a company pension plan, a simple way to accumulate private retirement savings.\nLegislators in five states, including California, Illinois, and Maryland, have passed laws mandating that most private employers offer their workers automatic enrollment in a retirement savings plan.

He mischaracterized Dr King's dream saying it was to make everything equal in everybody's house. Sharpton said MLK did not fight simply to put one black family in the White House.\nMLK was a Republican. And yet, Al Sharpton addressed a congregation of ill-informed blacks, lying to them about MLK's mission. Sharpton thrives on keeping racial tension, suspicion and hate alive.\nTo maintain relevance and his cherished seat of power at the Democratic Party round table, Sharpton must continue to deliver a mind numb monolithic black vote; proving himself to be an asset to the furtherance of their social justice agenda.

UK researchers accidentally uncovered the lurking networks while probing Twitter to see how people use it.\nSome of the accounts have been used to fake follower numbers, send spam and boost interest in trending topics.\nOn Twitter, bots are accounts that are run remotely by someone who automates the messages they send and activities they carry out. Some people pay to get bots to follow their account or to dilute chatter about controversial subjects.\n\"It is difficult to assess exactly how many Twitter users are bots,\" said graduate student Juan Echeverria, a computer scientist at UCL, who uncovered the massive networks.\nMr Echeverria's research began by combing through a sample of 1% of Twitter users in order to get a better understanding of how people use the social network.\nHowever, analysis of the data revealed some strange results that, when probed further, seemed to reveal lots of linked accounts, suggesting one person or group is running the botnet. These accounts did not act like the bots other researchers had found but were clearly not being run by humans.\nHis research suggests earlier work to find bots has missed these types of networks because they act differently to the most obvious automated accounts.\nThe researchers are now asking the public via a website and a Twitter account to report bots they spot to help get a better idea of how prevalent they are. Many bots are obvious because they have been created recently, have few followers, have strange user names and little content in the messages.\nIt was \"amazing and surprising\" to discover the massive networks, said Dr Shi Zhou, a senior lecturer from UCL who oversaw Mr Echeverria's research.\n\"Considering all the efforts already there in detecting bots, it is amazing that we can still find so many bots, much more than previous research,\" Dr Zhou told the BBC.\nTwitter deserved praise for its work on finding and eliminating bots, he added, but it was clear that skilled hackers had found ways to avoid official scrutiny and keep the bots ticking over.\nThe pair's most recent work had uncovered a bigger network of bots that seemed to include more than 500,000 accounts.\n\"Their potential threats are real and scary due to the sheer size of the botnet,\" he said.\nIt was hard to know who was behind the collections of fake accounts, said Dr Zhou, although there was evidence that a small percentage of the accounts had been sold or rented as they were now following Twitter users outside the main bot network.\n\"What is really surprising is our questioning on the whole effort of bot detection in the past years,\" said Dr Zhou. \"Suddenly we feel vulnerable and don't know much: how many more are there? What do they want to do?\"\nA Twitter spokesman said the social network had clear policy on automation that was \"strictly enforced\".\nUsers were barred from writing programs that automatically"}

His former law partner, Stamford Probate Judge Gerald Fox Jr., administered the oath, ending the six-and-a-half-year tenure of Gov. M. Jodi Rell.\nIn his speech after taking the oath, Malloy said the state is at a \"crossroads of crisis and opportunity.\"\nMalloy said he is optimistic about the future, but it will take \"shared sacrifice\" throughout the state.\n\"Today I see an economic crisis, an employment crisis, both fueled by an anti-business environment,\" he said, calling for bipartisan cooperation on tackling the state's financial problems. Malloy praised his late mother for pushing him, the youngest of eight children, past his childhood disabilities.\nThe first Democratic governor in 20 years, Malloy told a crowd of about 2,600 in the William A. O'Neill Armory his now-familiar story of overcoming physical and learning disabilities to graduate college with honors, then lead his hometown for 14 years, through a period of unprecedented growth.\nAfter a 15-minute parade around the Capitol, Malloy entered the armory to a standing ovation and shared the podium at the armory with his family, lieutenant Gov. Nancy Wyman and other constitutional officers, all Democrats who swept the recent election. All but Wyman, who was sworn in during a morning ceremony in the Capitol, also took the oath of office prior to Malloy.\nNikki O'Neill, widow of the last Democratic Gov. William A.

Business leaders complain the state is hostile to job creation. Electric rates are among the highest in the nation. The state's cities are struggling.

{"idx": "2567", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A recent late-night walk with my border collie Zoe has transported me back to one of the darkest, dreariest days of my 30-year journalistic career. Following her gaze down a utility easement east of Bryan Park a half mile south of downtown Bloomington, I saw a young whitetail deer, frozen by our presence, hauntingly backlit by a streetlight half a block to the south. Since then, I have read documents from, and stories about, the Bloomington-Monroe County Deer Task Force, which is poised to recommend that city deer be shot.\nBoth the weather and the mood were cold and dark in Brown County State Park that Saturday nearly two decades ago. The story described the weather as \u201ca steady rain that vacillated between a cold, dank mist and outright deluges.\u201d The roads leading to the park gates were lined with anti- and pro-hunt protesters and counter-protesters when the first shot was fired at 7:32 a.m., two minutes after the hunt began.\nRoughly 100 Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials and conservation officers kept the public out until the shooting ended eight-and-a-half hours later.\nThroughout the day, hunters emerged from the hills and valleys with dead whitetails draped over their shoulders. The animals ended up in mountainous piles at check-in stations located throughout the 16,000-acre park. Hunters got to keep one for themselves and donated any others they killed to a food bank to feed the hungry.\nOpponents had challenged the Brown County hunt in court, only to have an Indiana Court of Appeals panel, which included former Monroe Superior Court Judge John G. Baker, unanimously refuse to stop the historic event the day before it occurred. Never before had an animal been intentionally killed in an Indiana state park.\nThe 463 hunters were permitted to kill as many as 1,389 deer that day. Still, despite missing the target by more than a thousand, Indiana Department of Natural Resources officials declared the day a success.\nMy first exposure to urban deer predated by a decade and a half our recent Bryan Park encounters \u2013 first east of the park, then inside it and now west of it. In 1995, I read a New York Times Magazine story titled \u201cRats with hooves\u201d that detailed their migration into major metro areas like Philadelphia. It included tales of deer chowing on urban vegetation, such as gardens and flowers, the same story some Bryan Park neighbors relate today. Spurred by the Times piece, I penned an Aug. 10, 1995, H-T article titled \u201cSouthern Indiana again a home where the deer and coyotes roam\u201d that explored how human development patterns and wildlife management have caused deer populations, along with wild turkey and coyote, to explode in rural and urban areas.\nDeer and turkey had been hunted to extinction in Indiana by the late 19th century and were reintroduced in the 1930s, when New Deal-era programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps began reclaiming lands as federal and state forests, parks and wildlife areas. As late as the 1970s, wildlife experts told me, entire townships in Lawrence County were devoid of deer, largely due to poaching. Coyotes had most likely always had a remnant population in the state.\nAs the public lands were managed for wildlife and hunting was controlled, humans occupied the deer\u2019s territories, creating ideal conditions for them to flourish.

The targets are usually elderly and vulnerable homeowners who are cold-called or door-stepped by gangs posing as tradesmen.\nThey seem plausible and offer to repair guttering, roofs or driveways. Once the 'work' is carried out, the conmen turn nasty, demanding anything up to \u00a350,000 for a few hours' labour.\nAny protest is met with threats and when the victims cave in, they are frogmarched to the labourers' van and driven to their bank. Then, while the thugs lurk outside, the victim is forced to withdraw cash.\n'We have a lot of complaints about this crime,' says Steve Playle of Surrey Trading Standards.\nPlayle who is based in Leatherhead, Surrey, believes that the culprits are itinerant crooks, possibly part of travelling communities, who circulate lists among themselves of people who have succumbed once and who, the criminals believe, might well be worth targeting again.\nThese 'sucker lists' usually feature elderly, single women, often living in isolated locations or quiet suburbs.\nPlayle became so concerned last year that he involved Surrey Trading Standards, banks, building societies and the police in an initiative to try to stamp it out. The scheme relies on encouraging bank staff to recognise customers under duress. And it is starting to work.\nAndrea Lucas, a cashier with Lloyds TSB in Woking, played a pivotal role in the arrest of several criminals in May. Her quick thinking saved one Lloyds customer \u00a3 19,000 and helped the police to catch a gang that they had been tracking for months. Mike Hill, the manager of the town centre branch where the incident happened, says: 'The customer came in with an adult and a child aged seven or so.\nIn the privacy of a back office, 24-year-old Andrea immediately phoned Trading Standards' rapid response team. Meanwhile, the branch's CCTV cameras were trained on the suspects.\nWhile they waited, says Hill, another member of staff chatted with the customer to keep him at ease. The man cannot be named, but was 'clearly confused and vulnerable', according to branch staff.\nAs the wait dragged on, the adult suspect left the building, but the child remained and appeared to be watching the victim.\nThe Trading Standards team arrived soon after, closely followed by police. After a chase, the man outside the branch was arrested along with one other in the same gang.\nFor Playle, it was a significant coup. He says: 'It is horrifying to think that had they been successful, they might have targeted this vulnerable person again.' He knows of cases where victims have not only lost their entire savings, but have also been terrified and harassed.\nSurrey Trading Standards chalked up another victory recently after a woman phoned to say she was facing demands for \u00a32,000 from a gang who initially promised to tarmac her drive for \u00a335.\nThe men drove the woman, from Farnham, Surrey, to a bank to withdraw the cash, but because of the woman's call, police were waiting at her home when she returned.\nThe men involved were arrested but later released and the gang leader remains at large. Surrey Trading Standards impounded their vehicle.\nAccording to banks, it is difficult to assess the scale of this type of crime, but it is significant.\n\u2022 DON'T do business with uninvited doorstep sell"}

There\u2019s the abundance of food and the potential for family conflict. There\u2019s the addition of tons of tasks to your list. It can be overwhelming, no doubt.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased to share some insight from experts at the Eating Recovery Center on how to overcome these kinds of obstacles and stay healthy.\n1. Have a plan. Dr. Ovidio Bermudez, MD, chief medical officer and medical director of child and adolescent services at Eating Recovery Center, stressed the importance of communicating with your treatment team.\nCreate a plan for the holidays that emphasizes recovery, and prepare for the what-ifs that might come up, he said. For instance, consider how you\u2019ll navigate the stressors that used to trigger a relapse for you. Consider the many healthy options you\u2019ll use to cope with stress and potential challenges.\nIf you do find yourself overeating or resorting to disordered eating behaviors, be gentle with yourself. The holidays are the hardest time of the year for individuals with eating disorders and you are not expected to be perfect. It is important to remember that a healthy relationship with food takes practice. You wouldn\u2019t expect a piano student to play a concerto perfectly in front of an audience would you? Use any slips this holiday season as opportunities to reinvest in your recovery rather that beat yourself up and add to the pain.\nTry focusing on the holidays in a broader context with an emphasis on what you value. This can help individuals in recovery from an eating disorder shift from getting lost in the details that may trigger feelings of anxiety, sadness or fear.\nWhen we focus on the \u201cbigger picture\u201d during the holidays, the chance to spend time with friends and family, finding [a] present for a loved one or the opportunity to slow down and recognize what you are grateful for, the holidays no longer focus on eating disordered behaviors, but rather our values.\n\u201cRemember that you are celebrating and honoring traditions, both within your family and, when applicable, of your religious and cultural upbringing,\u201d said Karen Trevithick, PsyD, CEDS, clinical director of outpatient services at Eating Recovery Center.\n4. Focus on relationships. Eating disorders tend to narrow your world, and separate you from the people in your life. During the holidays, instead of isolating yourself, try to connect with others.\nTurn the focus from food. Make togetherness, rather than food, the central theme of your holiday season and seek opportunities to plan and attend events that do not center around a meal.\nAvoid \u201coverbooking\u201d your schedule. Prioritize your health and wellbeing over attending every holiday party, and be realistic about what you can manage.\nSurround yourself with people who have healthy relationships with their bodies and food. If possible, bring a trusted family member or friend with you to holiday gatherings for support.\nBy the way, you might find this post on holiday coping helpful. Stay tuned tomorrow for insight on supporting a loved one with an eating disorder during the holidays.\nHow will you navigate the holidays?

Stepping away gives you some room to breathe (and yes, maybe to cry).\nAs Sanchez-Burks says, \"Crying is emotional information.\"\nPay attention to what your tears are telling you. After your cry, take a second to self-reflect. Ask yourself what prompted the sobs. Are you stressed? Hungry? Fatigued? Fed up?\n\"If somebody feels such a powerful emotion, there's something that needs to be brought into the open,\" Sanchez-Burk says.\nAnd if the crying doesn't stop?

Nowadays, Vail Resorts just acquires the opposition.\nI made several more trips to Whistler over the years, never really grooving to the coastal skiing concept, although I loved the size of the place and the steepness and challenging nature of its terrain. I also really liked Vancouver and its international flare, although Whistler itself sort of struck me as a purpose-built and somewhat charmless ski village (compared to faux Bavaria).\nMy last trip up the Sea-to-Sky Highway was in 2010 when I took several weeks off from my day job covering energy and politics at the Colorado Independent and worked for the Olympic News Service as a sequel to my misadventures at the 2006 Torino Winter Olympics.\nAll the talk in Vancouver and then Whistler, where I covered the alpine skiing events, was of a possible takeover by Vail Resorts given the economic struggles of Whistler parent company Fortress Investment Group. That 2010 acquisition obviously never happened, but clearly Vail kept its eye on the Canadian resort and its huge clientele base of destination, international skiers.\nWhile American ski racers cleaned up at Whistler in 2010, including downhill gold for Vail\u2019s Lindsey Vonn and a combined gold for Bode Miller, the weather was atrocious as rain lashed the lower reaches of the courses and forced delays in five of 10 alpine events.\nI wrote about the implications of coastal Winter Olympics given the vagaries of climate change, including quotes from two-time Olympic gold medalist Ted Ligety on the topic after he was shut out at Whistler. Now that Vail has announced plans to acquire the place, I\u2019ll probably have to discontinue use of its \u201cPissler\u201d nickname (even though I first heard it from locals).\nI did have a few good ski days up there during the Games, with excellent powder at higher elevations, and the sheer size and dramatic scope of the place cannot be denied. Taken together, Whistler-Blackcomb offers more than 8,000 acres of skiable terrain, dwarfing even the sprawling mass of Vail Mountain at 5,200-plus acres.\nObviously, I prefer the drier continental snowpack of Vail and Utah, but Whistler makes a great addition to the Epic Pass and should prove especially enticing for skiers from Australia and Asia, which reportedly comprised a quarter of Whistler\u2019s destination guests at one point.\nI might even give the place another try now that it\u2019s set to be on my ski pass for the 2017-18 ski season. Certainly the $50 million Vail pumped into Park City paid off last season, creating a much more diverse and interesting ski product. It will be interesting to see what they do with Whistler.\nAnd to be clear, Whistler is an amazing mountain, and the terrain in that part of the world is not to be missed."}
{"idx": "2577", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Oil-field digital technology provider cuts costs to beats estimates.\nRigNet Inc (NASDAQ:RNET) reported its second-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday. While its revenue was affected by the downturn in the oil market, the company's bottom line improved as it cut costs. Because of that bottom-line improvement, as well as its strong balance sheet, the company believes it's well positioned to continue delivering solid results despite the near-term challenges in the energy marketplace.\nRigNet reported second-quarter revenue of $75.1 million. That represented a 6.9% decline over the prior year and 3.3% over last quarter and missed analysts' estimates by roughly $1 million. Driving this decrease was the significant downturn in the oil market, which is shrinking drilling budgets and therefore RigNet's market opportunity.\nDespite the weaker revenue, RigNet delivered a noticeable improvement on the bottom line, as it delivered cash earnings of $15.4 million, or $0.86 per share. That represents a 3.8% increase from the year-ago quarter and a 7.5% increase from last quarter. Meanwhile, GAAP earnings came in at $0.34 per share, which was a vast improvement from last quarter's $0.06-per-share loss while also beating the consensus estimate by $0.08 per share. Driving this better-than-expected result were adjustments that RigNet made to its cost structure, as general and administrative expenses fell 23% quarter over quarter to $16.4 million.\nThe company also kept its capex spending at bay, spending only $8.1 million during the quarter, which is significantly lower than the $11.4 million it spent in the year-ago quarter. This development resulted in a significant increase to the company's unlevered free cash flow, which surged 44.1% year over year to $10.4 million. As a result, the company's balance sheet remains very strong, with $61.5 million in cash against just $73.5 million in debt.\nRigNet expects the market to remain challenging in the near term, as the continued weakness in the oil price is a big headwind for customer spending. That said, it maintains a very strong financial position, which will enable it to execute its long-term growth plans even under current market conditions. Further, the company has the capacity to pursue acquisitions if a compelling opportunity is available.\nRigNet delivered a better-than-expected quarter thanks to come cost-cutting, which drove bottom-line growth even as the top line continues to shrink. The company will need to continue to keep its costs down as the oil market remains weak, with few signs of improvement especially after oil plunged 20% last month from its recent peak. Still, RigNet has the financial strength to weather this storm and wait for conditions to improve in the future."}

Or something.\nShapiro, writer and producer of a flurry of popular movie classics like \"Pillow Talk,\" \"Operation Petticoat\" and \"Touch of Mink,\" briskly tells the tale of David Russell, a man obsessed with saving John F. Kennedy to prevent his brother's subsequent death in Vietnam.\nObsession meets opportunity when David crosses paths with an eccentric scientist named Koopman who claims to have invented a time machine. One thing leads to another, David zips back to 1963 Dallas to stop Kennedy's assassination, but arrives too late to thwart Oswald and moreover is mistakenly fingered as the presidential assassin.\nTragicomic misadventure ensues, as David's girlfriend and Koopman travel back to try and save David (each time changing everything that happens later --as if history is penciled in, and all reality is relative).\nShapiro's tale unfolds swiftly and deftly, not unlike a screenplay, never lingering too long with any one insight or emotion as if for fear the audience will get up and leave. There are marvelous passages and some strong, visual writing.\nBut it all tumbles forward too neatly and inevitably, and David's narration is so terribly passionate and earnest it seems almost satiric.\nIt's a weird book; unapologetically pro-Kennedy (although the fine Collier/Horowitz biography \"The Kennedys\" even quotes Robert Kennedy to the point that, had his brother John lived, he would have continued the Vietnam War). You keep feeling Shapiro's gift for light, romantic comedy struggling up through the overwrought prose.\nYou keep wishing it would surface.\n\"Replay,\" a Literary Guild selection, similarly involves time travel back to 1963, and a passing attempt to save Kennedy, but it is a broader, sturdier, more traditional novel.\nGrimwood tells the story of Jeff Winston, a beleaguered journalist who dies in 1988 only to be mysteriously reincarnated at age 18 in 1963, with his life to live over again. He makes millions this time betting on things like the World Series and the Kentucky Derby, he lives an even emptier (but wealthier) life than he did before, and then dies again in 1988 and goes back to 1963 to . . . \"replay\" it all over again.\nAnd then again. And again.\nUnlike Shapiro's protagonist, Winston never radically changes the world's history, but each time he replays his life he does it differently, striving all the while to understand why he's caught in the cycle, what he's supposed to learn from it.\nIt's a fascinating premise, yet aside from some sharply drawn socio-historical references and backdrops, Grimwood seems content to construct a series of pithy pulp experiences for his protagonist, and an encyclopedia of pulp romances: the hedonistic sexual tigress, the frigid heiress, the pure college sweetheart, the brilliant true love who's also replaying her life. . . ."}

Peter Moore is a more assured, low-key sort, but he's forceful, and EA Sports titles are a good draw. Kelly Zmak from Radical Entertainment could certainly sell a game on late night television, to bring up someone who may not be a household name.

In some cases where an overheating Note 7 has caused damage to a person\u2019s home, some reports suggest Samsung isn\u2019t paying up.\nThe curious case of Samsung\u2019s Note 7 device should be rather well known by now, but in a nutshell it involved a smartphone design that permitted overheating to the point of combusting or exploding, in around 100 cases of the 2.5 million or so issued. This often occurred even after the phones were replaced with a supposedly safe alternative, and some incidents resulted in damage to homes or vehicles.\nIt\u2019s in those latter cases where something other than the phone was damaged that Samsung is purportedly not being quite so generous. The Guardian cites three cases where those with homes damaged by their toasty handset have been given the cold shoulder by the Korean manufacturer.\nIn one case involving a man who\u2019s bedroom was damaged by fire, smoke and \u201cchemicals,\u201d the damage is estimated at $9,000. So far, Samsung\u2019s best offer for recompense has been to offer a depreciated value for the affected items.\nIn another case, a firefighter from South Carolina believes his Note 7 was responsible for a portion of his house burning down. His garage was completely destroyed by a blaze that started overnight. The fire also caused extensive damage to his vehicles, much of the home\u2019s electrical wiring, a water heater, and some priceless family heirlooms.\nAlthough admittedly it has not been confirmed that the Note 7 was responsible, a Samsung employee initially said that they would move him into a hotel and pay for his meals. However, Samsung Fire and Marine, the insurance firm for the company, later said it wouldn\u2019t foot that bill. The man is still negotiating with Samsung, having first contacted them several weeks ago.\nIn the final case, a man from Richmond, Virginia, who claims his nightstand was damaged by a burning Note 7, has only had messages from Samsung indicating that the company is interested in retrieving the phone. As in the aforementioned cases, he is keen to hold on to the device until Samsung agrees to compensate him for the damage.\nIn each of these instances the Consumer Product Safety Commission has been contacted and it is conducting its own investigation into the Samsung Note 7 debacle. While it continues looking in to the matter, the CPSC has urged all customers to hand in their Note 7 to guarantee that they do no further harm to the owners or others."}

A new study suggests just 1 minute of vigorous exercise three times weekly can benefit health just as much as longer, conventional endurance training.\nResearchers found subjects who engaged in 1 minute of intense cycling three times a week showed significant health benefits.\nLead author Martin Gibala, professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, and colleagues recently published their findings in the journal PLOS One.\nIt is no secret that exercise is good for health, reducing the risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and a wealth of other conditions.\nThe 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise each week, or a combination of the two.\nHowever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than half of adults in the United States meet these guidelines.\nWhile the reasons for not exercising vary, \"lack of time\" is one of the most common, especially with Americans' increasingly busy lifestyles.\nBut the new research from Prof. Gibala and colleagues challenges this excuse, after finding just short bursts of intense exercise are just as beneficial as longer endurance training.\nIn a previous study, the researchers found that sprint interval training (SIT) produced significant health benefits.\nThis 10-minute training program included three 20-second \"all-out\" cycle sprints, performed in between 2 minutes of low-intensity cycling. The program also included a 2-minute warm-up and a 3-minute cool down.\n\"This is a very time-efficient workout strategy,\" notes Prof. Gibala. \"Brief bursts of intense exercise are remarkably effective.\"\nFor the new study, the team compared the SIT program with a moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) program. This 50-minute program included a 2-minute warm-up, followed by 45 minutes of continuous cycling at a moderate pace, and a 3-minute cool down.\nThe researchers enrolled 27 sedentary men to their study, all of whom were matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and VO2 peak - a measure of the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during aerobic exercise.\nSome of the men were required to engage in three weekly sessions of either SIT or MICT for 12 weeks, while the remaining men were assigned to a control group that did not exercise.\nAt the end of the 12-week training period, the researchers found that both the SIT and MICT groups experienced similar health benefits from their exercise regimes, compared with the control group.\nIn detail, both groups showed improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, insulin sensitivity - how the body regulates blood sugar - and levels of mitochondria in skeletal muscle.\nMitochondria are the \"powerhouses\" of cells, and reduced mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle has been linked to poor insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.\nBased on their findings, Prof. Gibala and colleagues suggest that engaging in just 1 minute of vigorous exercise three times a week is just as beneficial as the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week.\n\"Most people cite 'lack of time' as the main reason for not being active.

As a mother you blame yourself, I thought perhaps because I had her late in life I could be the cause of this.\nSkyler\u2019s feminine traits started showing through around the age of 2. As Seth, he didn\u2019t care for the same interests his brother, Archie, and stepbrothers, Chayse, 17, Dayne, 21, and Jye, 22, did.

He wasn\u2019t into Thomas the Tank Engine and Legos.\nInstead, he would ask sister Nykisha to take him to the girls\u2019 section of stores, ignoring Thomas the Tank Engine and Lego sets to play with the Barbie dolls, tiaras, and dresses.\nSkyler\u2019s father, Brett, recalls everyone thinking \u201cSeth\u201d was just going through a phase with his girl interests, but it became more apparent as she got older. Dr. Strathis diagnosed Skyler with \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d which is when a person feels they were born into the wrong body representing their sexual identity. A series of probing questions were asked to Skyler before he was diagnosed. He was asked about favorite colors, toys, friends, and ideas about forms of playing.\nWhen the 6-year-old was allowed to live as a female instead of a male, Seth\u2019s transition made him immediately happy.

And then there was Bristol.\nWhether or not she deserved to win or deserved to be on the finale, most everyone had a strong opinion one way or another.

She had been suffering from lymphatic cancer.\n'The cancer was incredibly aggressive and over the past few days, Duchess became increasingly weak and more lethargic,' Gary West, executive vice president of animal health, said in a statement.\nDuchess had been diagnosed with the cancer two weeks ago after zoo officials noticed she had a loss of appetite and lethargy. An ultrasound test revealed the cancer.\nWest said efforts were made to make Duchess 'as comfortable as possible' in her final days. She could be seen peeking from underneath her blanket in her enclosure, too weak to get up.\nDuchess was born in the Borneo jungle, where she was orphaned at a young age. She arrived at the Phoenix Zoo when she was two, and was one of the park's first animals when it opened in 1962.\nIn the zoo's early days, she would tour local businesses as part of fundraisers and became comfortable with human contact, officials said.\nA mainstay of the zoo and one of its most popular attractions, Duchess was feted with an all-day celebration in March 2010, marking her 50th birthday.\nShe was given a frozen treat with her favourite fruit inside, a giant birthday card signed by zoo-goers and a 'Happy Birthday' song from visitors.\nIt kicked off a fundraising campaign for a $4 million orangutan exhibit, which opened in April 2011.\nIn her life, Duchess gave birth to seven offspring who are now at zoos across the country. She outlived four of her children.\nShe leaves behind a daughter, Bess, a granddaughter, Kasih, and the lone male, Michael, at Phoenix Zoo. Among her other offspring across the country, she leaves behind a great grandchild.\nOfficials at the zoo mourned the passing of Duchess, but noted that it is common for orangutans to live 30 years in the wild and an estimated 40 years in captivity.\n'Although we are deeply saddened by Duchess's passing, she long surpassed the number of years that orangutans live in zoos and preserves, as well as in the wild,' the zoo's president, Bert Castro, said in a statement.\nKeepers at the zoo became emotional as they talked about their relationship with Duchess.\n'I spend more time in a day, in a week, in a month than I do any human in my life,' senior keeper Bob Keesecker told News 12.\n'What I remember really is my relationship with her.

But don\u2019t let that lead you to make a hasty purchase.\nWhile Chicago has been partying about the Blackhawks\u2019 heart-stopping win this week, in other cities they\u2019re partying about the runup in home values. Case-Shiller\u2019s latest data, out Tuesday, showed that while our recovery is chugging along, in many other cities the market is zooming.\nBut Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, suggested Tuesday that do-or-die last-minute shots like Dave Bolland\u2019s are best attempted on the ice, not in home purchases.\nIn cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Las Vegas, where Case-Shiller says prices in April were more than 20 percent higher than where they had been a year ago, Yun says, \u201cpeople are being forced to make rush judgments about one of the most expensive purchases in their lives.\u201d Tight inventory, fast bidding, and the prospect of paying much more just a month or so down the line prod buyers to make a hasty decision that they might regret later.\nBut in Chicago, where prices rose a healthy but not scary 9.3 percent for the year\u2014below the top 20 cities\u2019 average of 12.1 percent\u2014there\u2019s less frantic haste. \u201cIn Chicago, people can take the time to make a more financially comfortable decision,\u201d Yun said.\nYun said this to me in a private interview after making a forecasting presentation to members of MORe, the association of suburban Chicago real estate agents. If his comment sounds like he was trying to put lipstick on a pig, he wasn\u2019t. Chicago is at last recovering healthily: that 9.3-percent price growth was above six other major U.S. cities, pulling us up off the lower rungs for the first time in a while.\nChicago\u2019s large \u201cshadow inventory,\u201d or the number of properties in some stage of foreclosure that haven\u2019t yet been seized by the banks, is problematic now and could become more so later. The big shadow inventory is caused largely by Illinois\u2019 judicial foreclosure process that prolongs the time that a distressed property waits to return to the open market. This keeps potentially buyable homes from joining the available inventory, and keeps potential buyers hoping for more low-priced homes, so they put off buying conventional homes that are on the market.\nThat shadow inventory, Yun pointed out, could become an even bigger liability\u2014if more downward shocks to the economy occur and stomp down buyer confidence. \u201cThere won\u2019t be buyers to buy them when they come on the market,\u201d he said.\nBut he\u2019s not forecasting any big downturns, either nationally or in Chicago. Chicago has two weights on its shoulders: a higher-than-the-norm unemployment rate and a hugely suppressed homebuilding industry. One hurts the demand side, the other the supply side.

There\u2019s something about the chance to work closely with the land, to have more chooks than suburban living allows, to grow one\u2019s own fruit and vegetables, that I yearn for. I know this is not a unique dream\u2014the possibility of escaping into the country seems to hold out a tantalising promise to many of us. Poets and writers have been romanticising the country, the pastoral life, since at least the 3rd century bc when Theocritus poetically idealised rural life in his Idylls. In this literary tradition, happiness was associated with the simple, natural life of the shepherd tending his flocks. The opposed image was the corrupt city, with the bitter competition of its inhabitants for ever more worldly goods.\nClearly, country life is not simple or innocent like this. The predominant images of the country these days are more consistent with our nightmares than our idealisations. Rural areas are portrayed both as redneck wastelands and as places that were formerly pleasant, but have now been devastated by drought\u2014natural and economic. We pity their lost schools, banks and other community resources while fearing their xenophobia. Or so it seems through our popular media.\nAnd yet the dream of escaping to the country for a different, fresher life remains strong. So what are the possibilities for such a move? What are the consequences and costs? And why is the idea of uprooting and starting again in the country such a tantalising one? Two recent books, David and Gerda Foster\u2019s A Year of Slow Food (2001) and Patrice Newell\u2019s The Olive Grove (2000), give a sense of the dreams and realities of particular kinds of rural life. Both trace the move from the city to the country, but the country life they moved to is markedly different from our conventional imaginings.\nIn the mid-1970s David and Gerda Fostermoved from Sydney to a rundown house in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and began the process of rebuilding the house and living off the land. Twenty-five years on, A Year of Slow Food charts a year of growing and cooking almost all their food. Written in journal form, it details the week-by-week activities while also reflecting on the 25 years past. It\u2019s an engrossing tale, ranging from what it was like bringing up eight children to managing their menagerie of chooks, cows, pigs and bees. Fittingly, each chapter ends with a (usually) mouth-watering recipe from the week\u2019s produce.\nIn the mid-1980s Patrice Newell was tired of her life as a television presenter, and with her partner, Phillip Adams, bought Elmswood, a farm in New South Wales\u2019 Upper Hunter Valley. The Olive Grove follows her attempts to make the 4000-hectare property sustainable by farming biodynamic beef cattle and starting an olive grove. It, too, is fascinating in its details\u2014from managing cattle in a drought to the taste of fresh olive oil and the politics of water management.\nOut here, around the hills of Gundy, no one is watching.

It was their dad who broke a long-time custom of arranged marriages between the two families, and so the twins must pay the price for his non-conformity to tradition. The sisters of course refuse, because they\u2019re in love with their respective boyfriends played by hunk actors Dingdong Dantes and Zanjoe Marudo.\n\u201cKimmy and Dora have to discover on their own why this is happening to them all of a sudden.

Although the Terriers gave up the ball a good amount themselves, their zone never allowed Holy Cross to get comfortable when the Crusaders (12-10, 3-6 Patriot League) were on offense.\nHoly Cross turned the ball over seven times in the first half, leading to several easy baskets for BU in transition. All night, BU defenders got into passing lanes and pestered Holy Cross ball handlers.\nAt the break, the Terriers led 30-26, but the score was not that close for long. BU went on a 21-9 run to start the half after big plays from junior forwards Max Mahoney and Tyler Scanlon.\nFirst, Mahoney raced down the floor for a putback dunk, forcing the Crusaders to call a timeout 2:16 into the half. Then, Scanlon came up with the steal and a dunk that sent the crowd into overdrive.\nA few minutes later, Mahoney made the crowd erupt again, scoring on a basket with a foul after a loose ball bounced off multiple players and sent a few to the floor. When the dust cleared, BU had a 51-35 lead and had effectively ended the game.\nThe duo of Scanlon and Mahoney was unstoppable against Holy Cross.

{"idx": "2632", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A new book exposes false assumptions behind GOP and Democratic strategies.\nIn April, a child born somewhere in California made Hispanics the state's largest racial-ethnic group, replacing whites. Texas will be majority-Hispanic by 2020. In Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, and South Dakota, Hispanic populations have doubled since 2000.\n\"If the past is the prologue, the more than 53 million souls who make up this (mostly) new American community may well rewrite the political history of the United States,\" social scientists Matt Barreto and Gary Segura write in their new book, Latino America. And yet, they say, Republican and Democratic strategies toward Hispanics are largely built on false assumptions.\nMyth #1: Hispanic racism and/or antagonism toward African-Americans threatens the Democratic coalition. \"Latinos are not immune to the racism that is prevalent in American society,\" Segura told me via email, a follow-up to an hour-long conversation about the book. But their analysis of voting data, coupled with polling that measures racial attitudes, found two clear differentiators between whites and Hispanics.\nFirst, Hispanics are significantly less likely than whites to present racial hostility. Second, while the racial attitudes of whites are strikingly predictive of their voting behavior, there is virtually no correlation among Hispanics between attitudes and action.\nIn other words, the most bigoted Hispanics were no less likely to vote for Barack Obama than the most tolerant Hispanics. Among whites, antiblack attitudes almost always led to a vote against Obama.\n\"Racial resentment, or animus, while not altogether absent among Latinos, did not play a meaningful role in shaping their preferences in the 2008 election,\" Segura and Barreto wrote in Latino America.\nMyth #2: Hispanics are religious conservatives, ripe for GOP appeals. The authors' polling suggests that Hispanics are generally less likely to support abortion rights than whites, but only by a margin of about 10 percentage points. On marriage equality, Hispanics are at least as supportive, and in some cases are more liberal than whites.\nBut these aren't issues that generally determine how Hispanics vote. When asked to name the two \"most important\" problems, the combined total for all moral/values issues never rises above 3 percent. In a December 2011 study conducted by the authors, overwhelming majorities of Hispanic voters said they don't want ministers giving them political direction; don't want politicians relying on their personal religious beliefs; and think politics should focus on economic kitchen-table issues, not social issues.\nIn other words, like on matters of race, Hispanics hold strong views about social issues, but don't predicate their votes upon them.\nMyth #3: Hispanics are \"self-reliant\" conservatives, ripe for GOP appeals. Nearly three-quarters of Hispanics tell pollsters that if minorities don't do well, they have only themselves to blame. Among whites, voters sharing that view almost always support small-government conservatism. Not so among Hispanics.\n\"In fact,\" the authors write, \"though a significant majority of Latinos express support for self-reliance, supermajorities of Latinos also reliably embrace a greater role for government. Latino Americans evidently see no contradiction of the two views.\"\nHispanics tend to believe that government growth is a consequence of big social challenges, and they trust government more than the free market to improve the lives of Americans"}

That is only a little over four years from now, so the agency decided it had to expedite the bidding process pending EHIA approval.\nRatanachai said Egat would need at least a year to finalise the selection of the contractor, and then construction would take another four years. Because of the tight schedule, tendering and other contractor-selection work had to be done in parallel with the EHIA process.\nOn the other hand, if the project is unable to get the EHIA green light, it will not go ahead and the bids will be scrapped.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha told Krabi residents who came to Bangkok and staged the protest at Government House that his regime would review the project, but he urged them to allow Egat to go ahead with the tendering process while the EHIA was under way.\nMeanwhile, the National Reform Council\u2019s energy reform committee has submitted its report on the sector\u2019s restructuring to increase competition, efficiency and energy security.

The debate continues to rage, and no doubt you have your view.\nBut this piece is less about how Bob chose to die, and more about what really killed him. For he had a particularly deadly form of lung cancer called mesothelioma, and he got it, as all sufferers do, from exposure to asbestos, still present in buildings everywhere.\nHe was diagnosed just one month ago, and he was already on hefty doses of morphine and still doubled up in pain. No-one ever survives mesothelioma; they can\u2019t cut out the cancer, and chemotherapy is ineffective.\nI\u2019ve seen it up close. More than 20 years ago, I visited a street in Clydebank, close to where my mother had grown up. Every second or third house, someone was suffering from \u2013 or had already succumbed to \u2013 lung cancer, asbestosis or mesothelioma.

I expected those many lumps to be soft, but they were rock hard, and I thought of knitting needles sticking out from the inside. This then was mesothelioma. He died two days later.\nHe had worked in shipbuilding when the Clyde led the world. So did most of the men in the street.

The court ruling appears to have seriously hobbled the FCC's ability to enforce its network neutrality principles, which call for nondiscriminatory treatment of different applications traveling over public networks, among other things.\nBut Klinker told eComm he isn't afraid of carriers creating \"walled gardens\" of selected content turn the Internet into the equivalent of cable TV. They also would have a hard time selling network management programs based on \"discrimination,\" he said. What consumers really want are steps to ease delays during times of heavy usage, according to Klinker. BitTorrent even has its own mechanism for doing this, called Micro Transport Protocol, and has rolled it out to the users of its software.\nCarriers probably won't try to be gatekeepers against certain websites or Internet-based services because the steps they would have to take, he said.\n\"For example, if (carriers) wanted to extract a rent from Google, one of the carriers in this room is going to have to blink first and block Google,\" Klinker said. The greater threat to the Internet may be Apple's \"feudal\" approach to the Internet, he said. Apple has come under fire for controlling access to popular, lucrative platforms of its own creation, such as iTunes and the iPhone App Store.\nMost people basically want net neutrality, so it would be hard for carriers to justify network management measures that are seen as discriminatory, Klinker said. What consumers will embrace are moves to ease congestion during busy times.\n\"Management practices devoted to this problem, I think, are totally defensible,\" Klinker said. He used the analogy of ambulances traveling quickly through crowded streets because other drivers pull over for them. \"Neutral and priority can -- in fact, they do -- coexist,\" he said.\nThis is the principle behind Micro Transport Protocol, Klinker said. The system instructs BitTorrent to take up unused capacity on a network so, for example, it will hold back during a busy work day to let more critical applications maintain their performance, he said. When it senses delays, it slows down, helping other applications maintain low latency.\nBitTorrent has been developing Micro Transport Protocol for several years. In January, it declared the software stable and provided it as an automatic update to users of the company's own BitTorrent client. (Users who don't choose to"}

Williamson had a career-best 35 points to go with 10 rebounds in the loss.\nWhile the Blue Devils were at one point considered to be national title favorites this season, Pippen felt Williamson had to think more about the big picture and that the athletic forward has already proven himself midway through the 2018-19 season to be worthy of the No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft.\nMore: Does highlight-reel dunking overshadow Zion's overall greatness?\nPippen, a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, said Williamson is \"definitely going to be the No. 1 pick.\" Mock draft boards either have Williamson or his Duke teammate R.J.

The discovery may lead to a new treatment for the neurodegenerative condition.\nA 44-year-old man with two copies of a mutation in a gene called APP first showed signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in his mid-thirties. Yet his relatives with a single copy of the mutation \u2013 including an 88-year-old aunt \u2013 seem to be protected from the disease, new research suggests.\nMimicking this single-copy condition with a drug could offer a new way of treating Alzheimer\u2019s, says Fabrizio Tagliavini, a neurologist at Carlo Besta National Neurological Institute in Milan.\nTagliavini\u2019s team uncovered the mutation in a person who showed signs of early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s but who lacked mutations in other genes associated with this inherited form of the disease.\nOnly a small percentage of Alzheimer\u2019s cases are linked to a single, inherited mutation, yet researchers have made great strides in understanding the more common late-onset form of the disease by studying these mutations.\nThe gene in question, APP, makes a protein called A-beta, which sticks together in the brain and blocks neurons from communicating with one another. Many researchers argue that such clumps underlie the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, such as memory and speech difficulties.\nSix of the patient\u2019s relatives with one copy of this mutation show no sign of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, while a younger sister with two copies has some cognitive problems, but not full-blown Alzheimer\u2019s, Tagliavini says. This stands in stark contrast to other mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, where a single copy is enough to cause the disease.\nIn a bid to explain this difference, Tagliavini\u2019s team analysed cells taken from the 44-year-old man. His cells developed far more A-beta clumps than cells extracted from people without normal APP.\nWhen the team mixed normal and mutant forms of the protein, the mixture clumped far less often than mutant protein or normal protein alone. This could be why the patient\u2019s relatives with one copy of the mutation seem able to stave off Alzheimer\u2019s, he says.\nRecreating this situation with a synthetic protein could offer a new way of treating the disease in people with two copies of the APP mutation, Tugliavini says. Indeed, his team found that a mutant protein just six units long (proteins are usually much longer) is enough to keep the proteins from aggregating into clumps.\nThis kind of smaller protein has a better chance of travelling from blood vessels, across the blood-brain barrier and into the brain, but Tagliavini admits the potential therapy will need much more tinkering \u2013 not to mention testing. \u201cWe are very far from this point, but we can work on this,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThere are other anti-aggregation therapies that are much further along,\u201d notes Rudolph Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who was not involved in the study.\nTanzi founded a company called Prana Biotechnology that is now testing one such therapy in patients, but Tanzi says the more Alzheimer\u2019s drugs that are in development, the better.\nWhatever happens, the newly discovered APP mutation will change how researchers think about the genetics of the disease, he says.

The meeting was more of a guide though, and it didn't have any restrictions put into place to stop any demolition. That means the city could not stop a demolition permit.\nThe only way to stop these kind of changes is if the homes have a historic design permit.

The dominance of Russia which had lasted for 200 years was questioned by new actors, primarily the United States, Turkey and Iran. The South Caucasus, with its vital links to the Black Sea, Central Asia and Middle East, and its rich natural resources (primarily oil and gas in the Caspian Sea) became a complex battleground aggravated by internal problems such as the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan due to territorial claims of the former with regard to the latter\u2019s Nagorno-Karabakh region.\nWhile the geopolitical conditions of the 1990s were defined internally by ethnic conflicts, the creation of statehood, and the transition from communism to a market economy, external factors were connected with the arrival of the new powers \u2013 the US, EU, Turkey, Iran on one side, and efforts by Russia to maintain control on the other. A wave of \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d in 2003-2005 further changed the political landscape of the regional states and increased the possibility of ending Russian influence in post-Soviet space. However, despite losing its influence in the 1990s, Russia, due largely to enormous profits from oil, gained the momentum to strengthen its position by 2008.\nThe Georgian-Russian War had adverse effects on the image of the West in the region. The verbal support from the US, EU and NATO was not enough to counter the Russian offensive. Russia showed assertively that it would resort to force rather than yield its influence in the South Caucasus. Accordingly, attempting to secure NATO membership by regional countries has posed a direct threat to their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Post-Soviet countries realized that Russia is still a mighty power, and the West is not willing to confront her for the sake of small post-Soviet states.\nFurther, the US-Russian \u201creset\u201d declared by the Obama administration sent a clear message that relations with Russia are much more significant for the American administration and its Western allies than relations with other former communist states. However, many experts might not agree with that conclusion as they point out that the West continues to boost its relations with post-Soviet countries through the EU\u2019s new Eastern Partnership initiative, NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace program and other political and economic channels, the treatment of US allies like Azerbaijan and Georgia in regards to the April 2010 Washington Nuclear Security Summit speaks for itself.\nOn the other side, Russia\u2019s bold foreign policy in its so-called \u201cnear abroad\u201d, in various political and economic manifestations, was seriously damaged by the global financial crisis. The Russian economy endured great losses which affected its ability to sponsor its allies or show its influence as an economic power. Thus, the former Soviet countries appreciated the importance of economic relations with the West and the need for reform of their economies. Exclusive reliance on Moscow proved to be shaky. Even the new president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich, a staunch Russian ally, paid his first foreign visit to Brussels, exhibiting the desire of the new Ukrainian leadership to move closer to the West in terms of its economic preferences.\nThe victory of Yanukovich in the latest elections in Ukraine changed the colour of the 2004 \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d which brought his predecessor, Viktor Yushchenko, to power.

But the Mobile Market has a wide variety of items including fresh produce, according to Cousins.\nThe Mobile Market has around 25 volunteers per market with jobs ranging from unloading the truck to client registrars and food distributors.

It also puts him head and shoulders above the average Republican.\nBut let\u2019s not praise him too much on that account; much the same could be said of Ted Cruz. Because politically the two of them are so much alike, it is instructive to compare Kavanaugh with that villainous Texas Senator.\nOn the other hand, Kavanaugh is said to be a nice guy. As much or more than his qualifications, the GOP public relations line on him focuses on what a fine, husband, father, neighbor, and colleague he is. Perhaps he really is. But why should anyone who doesn\u2019t have to live with or otherwise deal with him on a personal basis care?\nCould it be that his handlers don\u2019t want anyone to think of him in the same frame as Cruz or, for that matter, the president who put his name forward? Niceness marks a clear difference between him and them.\nHis opponents emphasize the harm Kavanaugh will do if confirmed. They are right; his presence on the court will make the judiciary a bulwark of reaction for at least a generation.\nBy all accounts, Kavanaugh is at least as reactionary as Clarence Thomas, the most reactionary Supreme Court Justice in living memory. His confirmation will put every scintilla of social progress towards which the Supreme Court has contributed in recent and not so recent decades in jeopardy.\nUnlike a Supreme Court Justice\u2019s purported niceness, this is something everyone should care about.\nKavanaugh\u2019s views are malevolent. The sad fact is, though, that this is not unusual in the federal judiciary and in \u201cconservative\u201d academic precincts. Quite to the contrary, what Kavanaugh thinks about politics and law is, in one form or another and in varying degrees, widely accepted \u2014 and also preposterous, indeed, idiotic, on its face.\nIt remains to be seen how much of an ideologue Kavanaugh is, and how much of a capitalist stooge. Practicing \u201cconservatives\u201d in the United States are more often stooges than not.\nWe can only hope that in the battle for the soul of Brett Kavanaugh, the ideology wins out. Thanks to its connections to a kind of legal theory and practice, and to a related strain of conservative political philosophy that, however dubious its merits, is at least not idiotic, Kavanaugh\u2019s ideological commitments may be the best, if not the only, weapon against Kavanaugh-style idiocy available to us.\nSuppose that the American \u201cexperiment"}

{"idx": "2662", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: We all know that the kibbutzim failed as a social experiment: those that thrive today operate on markedly different principles than those of their utopian forebears. Having learned quite a lot about how and why so-called \"intentional communities,\" I really think we need to take another crack at building an alternative to single-family living arrangements. No, I don't mean we need to build more multi-family apartment buildings or condos, though we should certainly do that. I mean I think we need to encourage families and couples to \"double up,\" i.e., to live in closer quarters with strangers. If this sounds to you like Soviet-style communal apartments, you're on the right track.\nIt's quite common for recent graduates and single people to live in group houses or with roommates, first and foremmost to better spread costs and secondarily for comradely companionship. There is a sense that one ought to \"grow out\" of this phase of life, as though there is something slightly juvenile about living in such jumbled-up circumstances, and of course marital intimacy demands privacy. Or so we've come to believe.\nBut given the tremendous environmental costs of our housing stock, I think we need, as individuals, to start considering truly radical measures. Building new houses to Passivhaus standards (i.e., houses that maintain a consistent temperature without costly HVAC systems) is something we ought to aggressively pursue. A more immediate solution would be to use our existing housing stock more intelligently.\nBetween now and 2050, we will in all likelihood add well over 100 million people to the current US population of 100 million. And of course we've grown accustomed to steadily consuming more housing per person, even in the heart of our metropolitan areas. Some see this as a happy byproduct of rising affluence, and that's easy to understand. At the same time, it has encouraged a tremendous, absolutely perverse waste of space and energy. The mortgage interest deduction has something to do with this, and getting rid of it is almost certainly impracticable politically speaking.\nThe most effective way to \"communalize\" living arrangements in the privacy-conscious United States would be some kind of economic calamity. We don't want that.\nAnother way would be to sell it as an attractive alternative to anomie. And that's already happening. Shrewd developers are building vast \"condotels\" in cities across the country. These buildings, a longstanding obsession of mine, offering a wide array of hotel-like amenities to residents. Other buildings have full-time \"activity coordinators\" who are there to facilitate social interactions among residents, the kind of thing that you'd expect organically. Of course we can't expect that given the anonymity and heterogeneity of big cities, and the work schedules of the affluent.\n\"Co-housing\" communities, a middle ground between communes and private homes, are becoming increasingly popular among boomer retirees. This strikes me as a model that can and should spread.\nThe four couples, two widows and two who are now living solo live in eight individual town houses, grouped around an inner courtyard. Still under construction is the \"common house\" with a living room and a large kitchen and dining room for communal dinners; upstairs is a studio apartment they will rent at below market value to a skilled nurse who will provide additional care. It is their own self-styled, potluck utopia.\n\"It's an acknowledgment that intimacy doesn't happen by chance,\" said John Jungerman, 84"}

That will be addressed at a future hearing because the prosecution filed Wednesday what Roberto called an argument at the \"11th hour\" about the statute of limitations.\nAccording to the prosecution's filing, they argue the failure to report should not be dropped because law provides for it to be considered a continuing offense. Roberto contested after the hearing this morning that the law does not allow that.\nThe defense attorneys told the judge that they want the prosecution to turn over all of their investigation notes to see the evolution of the investigation. They said that could be important in seeing what witnesses, like McQueary, told police over the course of their multiple interviews.\nThe attorneys are also seeking more specific information about the alleged false statements, but Beemer told the judge the prosecution has provided information that's specific enough.\nCurley and Schultz are charged with lying to the grand jury investigating Jerry Sandusky, who has since been convicted of child sexual abuse.\nCurley is on administrative leave from his job as athletic director, while Schultz resigned as the senior vice president for finance and business in November.\nBoth men have maintained that they are innocent.\nNo trial has been scheduled yet."}

And first-class Air France was like a high-speed version of the court of Caesar Augustus. I expected to see a suckling pig butchered before my eyes as twinkly-eyed stewardesses (as they were called) carried jeroboams of Champagne for carousing passengers.\nAnd then everyone went to sleep for four hours. Not as refreshing as I'd been led to believe.\n(One small first-class story: The 747 had and presumably still has an upstairs part of first class.

And I got mad at everything in aviation.\nWhen planes were late and crowded, when ticket agents suddenly turned surly (nursing private grievances, I figured) and passengers became impatient and testy, there was no fun to be had. Then they put televisions in the waiting rooms, and cattle-call seating, and one foil-wrapped pretzel for your chewing pleasure - it was a bad scene.\nThe entire day of travel itself was no fun at all - rides to and from the airport over crowded superhighways, hotels that did not seem aware of one's existence, meals at haphazardly picked restaurants - or, worse yet, business meetings with old bagels and stale water.\nI would complain bitterly in the evening, having finally settled down only long enough to have to get up and go find some food, and I was told that I was powerless over these events, and I said I'd always been powerless; it just didn't seem that way before.

Of the 46 finalists, eight have been selected from the social impact category and will pitch in front of a live audience, a panel of judges, and top VC firms from around the world.\nSo who are this year\u2019s most innovative disruptors in the realm of social impact? Their breadth is impressive, and their goal collectively remains to make the world a better place, whether that is in the realm of safe drinking water, energy, science or technology.\nThe startup company is focused on commercializing disruptive technologies that help in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in women and children. The company focuses specifically on cancer, autoimmune diseases and childhood illnesses and aims to commercialize the most promising technologies in human diagnostics in an age of rapid innovation.\nThis genetic engineering startup created the Microbial Design Studio, a machine that will allow researchers, designers and innovators to test and research with microbial design and experimentation. One of the greatest value-adding elements of this technology is its aim to be inexpensive, easy to use and adequately sized, allowing the technology to be disseminated to the countertops of next-gen researchers.\nThis company designed the DayOne Waterbag, a 10-liter personal waterbag with patented technology that allows for the treatment, purification and storage of water. With the technology this personal waterbag provides, it can be easily distributed to survivors of natural disasters that may live in areas where water has become contaminated.\nThis Berlin-based company is creating products powered by solar technology to bring the world sustainable energy sources. Benefiting communities without electricity, this sustainable energy business is championed by designers and engineers alike, developing a product that brings both utility and high-quality design to communities that need it most.\nWith the tag line \u201cFireproofing the world, safely,\u201d this company has developed patent-pending and eco-friendly fire safety products that combat solid and liquid fires. Many fire retardant products include chemicals that are very harmful to the environment, and this is where Miraculum has found its differentiator. With no other clean technology solution in this market available, Miraculum\u2019s products can be used in both preventative and active firefighting situations.\nThe Tycycler is a non-motorized device designed to help informal waste workers recycle tires in Africa in a way that is affordable and efficient in comparison to the process used today. When wasted tires are burned, carcinogenic smoke is emitted and economic activity that could result from recycled tires is prevented. The few options that do exist for recycling tires are inefficient. The device first prototyped in Nigeria earlier this January will motivate informal workers to recycle tires through its ease of use and affordable engineering.\nThis company is innovating a new model for jaundice treatment through a product called SnugLit. The product uses a new approach to phototherapy that allows newborn infants to be held by their mothers and family members during their treatments, thus creating more efficient hospital procedures and using best practices in early-life bonding for infants and their mothers.\nThis Nigeria-based company has developed an incentivized method to give low-income communities the ability to find value in waste through cleaning up their neighborhoods. By deploying a fleet of low-cost bicycle-powered collection vehicles (wecycles), workers are able to collect materials and supply them to local waste management authorities, ensuring both cleanup and an active supply of materials for the recycling industry.\nFor these eight companies, innovation means leveraging technology, science and"}

There was even a small increase in federal government job openings.\nIt's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.\nThe so-called \"job skills gap\" is a major problem plaguing the U.S. economy, and it's a key issue that the next president will have to tackle. It's one of the many reasons why the economy has been beset by slow growth for years.\nIt also helps to explain why there are still high numbers of discouraged workers and people working part-time even though they want full-time jobs. Part-time workers are much more likely to live in poverty and live without benefits like health insurance or paid sick leave.\nThe skills gap is also one of the reasons why U.S. worker productivity has slowed. Experts across the board say job training programs and apprenticeships are a key ingredient to fix the problem.\nPresident Obama has spent a record amount on apprenticeships during his tenure in an attempt to reverse the long-term trend of a decline in apprenticeship programs.

The text released Thursday showed the Senate legislation would still make major changes to the nation\u2019s health care system, repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, drastically cutting back federal support of Medicaid, eliminating Obamacare\u2019s taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others. The Senate plan however would keep Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to help people pay for individual coverage.\nMcConnell\u2019s decision to keep the details tightly under wraps until Thursday was intentional and aimed at winning over his colleagues out of the public spotlight, but the secretive process has infuriated Democrats \u2014 and aggravated plenty of Republicans, too.\nMcConnell has very little room for error \u2014 he can only lose two Republican votes and still pass the bill.\nThe legislation will also have to undergo parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that it meets the strict requirements on what can or can\u2019t be included in a bill under the budget reconciliation process.\nMedicaid has been one of the central sticking points in the debate. The bill would continue the enhanced Medicaid expansion funding from Obamacare until 2021 and then phase it out over three years. This is a concession to moderates, who weren\u2019t pleased that the House version would end the enhanced support for new enrollees in 2020.\nThe Senate bill would also largely maintain Obamacare\u2019s premium subsidies structure, but tighten the eligibility criteria starting in 2020. Fewer middle class folks would get help because only those earning up to 350% of the poverty level would qualify, rather than the 400% threshold contained in Obamacare. But it would also open up the subsidies to enrollees below the poverty level so those living in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid could get some assistance.\nThe bill would also aim to shore up the existing Obamacare market by allocating funds for the cost-sharing subsidies until 2019. This will placate insurers, who were distraught by Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to continue making these payments, leading many carriers to hike rates or drop out of the exchanges for 2018.\nCNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report."}

{"idx": "2700", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The enormous tropical rain forest carpeting the Amazon Basin in north-central South America is famous for its globally outstanding biodiversity and luxuriant suite of indigenous human cultures. One of the planet\u2019s great wildernesses, it\u2019s also an international symbol of environmental destruction, long gnawed at by logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. The terrain of the basin as well as that of its bounding regions exerts profound effects on Amazonian ecology, and a basic understanding can further the ecotourist\u2019s appreciation of the landscape, the wildlife and the cultures.\nThe Amazon Basin is one of several major structural lowlands in South America, separated by up-warped highlands; others are the Orinoco and Chaco-Pampa basins. Sprawling across about 2.7 million square miles, the Amazon Basin is almost as big as the conterminous U.S., and ranks as the largest of the world\u2019s drainage basins. The ancient bedrock underlying the basin is mostly covered by thick layers of sedimentary materials, stemming both from the depositions of rivers draining the Andes and surrounding highlands and from a period when the basin lay beneath a shallow sea, some 2.6 to 5.3 million years ago. Topographically, the basin cants extremely subtly to the east. The great Amazon River, which flows more than 4,000 miles across the basin to the Atlantic, likely once drained to the Pacific, but the uplift of the Andes shifted its course to make the epic eastward journey.\nThe normal flooding cycles of the Amazon and its tributaries see the rivers spilling their banks and fanning out over the gentle topography of the basin floor. The inundation, which generally occurs in waves across the basin between December and May, spreads river sediment far and wide, a process that over time builds the extensive floodplains, or \u201cv\u00e1rzeas,\u201d across which the channels meander. So great is the weight of the annual flood that the South American continent depresses several inches as it spreads and rebounds as it retreats. Terraces, stemming from down-cutting by rivers through the old sea bed, separate these bottomlands from the older basin uplands, called \u201cterra firme,\u201d which lie above the annual floods.\nThe Amazon Basin is bounded on three sides by highlands and one by the Atlantic Ocean. West rise the Andes, source of the Amazon and the second-highest mountain range on Earth, after the Himalayas. Mount Mismi, the volcano in the Peruvian Andes that sources the Amazon, looms over 18,000 feet high. North of the basin are the Guiana Highlands; south of it are the Brazilian Highlands. Both represent blocks of the South American shield, the exposed portion of the continent\u2019s ancient core bedrock. The Guiana and Brazilian highlands angle toward each other in the east, so the Amazon Basin narrows as it approaches the Atlantic.\nTropical rain forest \u2013 the biggest on Earth \u2013 covers two-thirds of the Amazon Basin. Much of this lies on the terra firme uplands, but seasonally inundated bottomland rain forest occupies the floodplains in two basic types: the v\u00e1rzea, along so-called whitewater rivers, and the igap\u00f3 along blackwater and clearwater streams.

Once those steps are complete, the green bank could be launched and its governing board appointed. It could then start financing projects, Foley said.\nFunding for the green bank could come from a variety of sources. Foley said he will advocate for the county using public money to help launch the fund.\nOther organizations, such as the Gund Foundation, Cleveland Foundation, Key Bank, city of Cleveland and Council on Smaller Enterprise have been meeting with the county for months to help develop the idea. They could contribute money to the fund as well, but those details have yet to be worked out, Foley said.\nThe Coalition for Green Capital suggests that green banks should be launched with no less than $25 million in available capital, according to Foley.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t move forward until we know there\u2019s enough money in the fund,\u201d Foley said.\nThe Coalition for Green Capital, based out of Washington D.C., is the only organization that offers consulting to help develop green banks, and it has developed all the green banks currently operating in the country, according to Monday\u2019s Board of Control agenda.\nMost other green banks in America exist at the state level, such as those in Connecticut, New York, Nevada, and Colorado, but there is a county-level green bank in Montgomery County, Maryland as well, according to the coalition\u2019s website."}

There are countless smartwatches for tech nerds who\u2019d rather glance at their wrists to check messages than reach for their smartphones. And thousands of people are already seeing the world differently with the help of the Internet-connected eyewear, Google Glass.\nEven with the possibilities these devices offer today, gadget lovers can expect technology companies to stretch the wearable concept further this week in Las Vegas at the International CES event, the industry\u2019s annual trade show.\nSeveral companies are expected to unveil wearable devices that are easier to use, extend battery life, and tap into the power of gestures, social networks and cloud computing.\nThe wearables wave is still in its early phases. Many of the technologies on display will offer a glimpse of the future \u2013not necessarily products that are ready for the mainstream consumer.\nIndustry analysts\u2019 estimates for the growth of wearables are rosy. Research firm IHS says the global wearables market \u2014 which also includes health products like hearing aids and heart-rate monitors \u2014 could top $30 billion in 2018, up from nearly $10 billion at the end of 2013.\nWhile some of the growth will come from an aging population that requires more health-related monitoring at home, devices like the Fitbit Force activity band \u2014 which tracks a wearer\u2019s steps, calories burned, sleeping patterns and progress toward fitness goals \u2014 are also expected to gain popularity as deskbound workers look for new ways to watch their waistlines.\nAt this week\u2019s show, companies are likely to introduce improvements in wearable screens and battery life, says Shane Walker, an IHS analyst. The two are linked because the more a device tries to do, the more battery power it consumes. This creates demand for innovative low-power screens, but also for ways to interact with devices that don\u2019t rely on the screen, such as using hand gestures and voice.\n\u201cWith wearable technology, it\u2019s all about battery consumption,\u201d Walker says.\nWhat\u2019s driving the boom in wearable device innovation is the recent widespread availability of inexpensive sensors known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

However, the economy is expected to rebound by the end of the year on the back of a recovery in the European Union, Russia's main trade partner, said Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst from Investcafe.\nA slower economy means reduced profits and less money that could be spent on wages and bonuses. And whatever funds become available are distributed across a few key employees, the Hay Group study said.\nThis leaves others with what they have, and they are bracing themselves for a fight against the growing cost of living.\nAn average living wage in Russia, which is the minimum income necessary to service essential bills and buy food, is 6,827 rubles ($211) per month. It is about 31 percent bigger than the official minimum wage of 5,205 rubles decreed by President Vladimir Putin this year.\nIn comparison, the average wage in Moscow is projected to reach 60,000 rubles ($1,860) per month in 2014 and 70,000 rubles in 2016, Itar-Tass reported.\nTo bridge the gap between Russia's living wage and minimum wage, the federal government would have to spend 55 billion rubles ($1.7 billion), former Deputy Health and Social Development Minister Alexander Safonov said. This is highly unlikely in the current economic climate, with the state already committing 20 trillion rubles to modernize the military for the period until 2020, experts said, New Izvestia reported.\nDmitry Chervyakov, a former steelworker from the Zlatoust Steel Mill in the Chelyabinsk region, brought up the problem of low wages at a meeting with then-President Dmitry Medvedev two years ago.\n\"[A steelworker] at our factory receives 13,000 rubles ($403) [per month],\" he said. \"But the work is very hard.

Because a car wash requires more supplies, utilities and employees when it's doing a high volume of business, car wash owners can expect high variable costs. In fact, almost all of the costs associated with running a car wash are variable ones.\nYour employees are a significant source of costs. Salaries, benefits and employee training can cost thousands of dollars each month. If your business is successful, you may need to hire more employees or promote part-time employees to full-time status. The costs of paying overtime -- one and a half times the employee's hourly rate -- and covering your share of payroll taxes can creep up steadily as you gain more business.\nYou can't run a car wash without soap, wax, cloths, car fragrances and similar items. The amount you'll spend on these items is directly tied to how much business you're doing. A successful car wash will have to invest much more in cleaning supplies and may decide to operate a small convenience store stocked with cards, foods and similar items. This can cut into your profits, but buying in bulk may help reduce the amount you spend.\nCar washes can quickly run up high utility bills. You'll have to pay the costs of electricity and water, and if you offer hot-water treatments, your costs can go even higher. The more cars you service, the more utilities you'll use. You might opt to pay for cable or Internet service as your client base increases, but because these utilities usually charge a flat fee, your costs won't vary after you sign up.\nSuccessful businesses have to review and revise contracts and may even face lawsuits from customers or employees. The more business you do, the more likely it is that you'll run into a legal problem, and the cost of an attorney can become a variable business cost. Likewise, you may have to contract with advertising agencies, and the amount you spend can depend on how much business you're doing. The costs of most professional services will generally increase along with your customer base."}

Armies had not changed their battlefield tactics in response to new, highly destructive weapons, resulting in massive casualties. Rising calls from British political leaders, the media, and the public demanded action to break the stalemate. British strategists responded by opening a new front in the east with two strategic objectives: drive Turkey out of the war by attacking Constantinople, and open a route to beleaguered ally Russia.3 The decision to open a second front in the east in 1915 ultimately failed to achieve Britain\u2019s strategic objectives during the first full year of World War I. British leaders pursued short-term, politically expedient military objectives in Turkey that were both ancillary to their military expertise and contrary to achieving the overall ends of winning the war by defeating Germany. This article examines the disastrous results of the attempt to open a second front and the disconnect between Allied strategic ends and means.\nWith combat in France and Belgium characterized by hopeless direct assaults on entrenched enemy positions, British strategists began planning for a new direction.4 First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill contemplated amphibious operations in the North Sea to increase pressure on Germany. He proposed a joint Anglo-French amphibious assault along the Belgian coast designed to outflank German positions on the Western Front, liberate the port of Zeebrugge, and prevent Germany from using Zeebrugge and Ostende as submarine bases.5 Ultimately, the British failed to convince the French to participate, effectively scuttling Churchill\u2019s North Sea plan.\nBritish political and military leaders next focused attention on Turkey and the possibility of military operations to seize the Dardanelles,6 attack Constantinople, and open a line of communication to Russia. Secretary of the War Cabinet Maurice Hankey, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, and Churchill advocated military operations against Turkey on the Gallipoli Peninsula.7 They agreed that the Ottoman Empire was weak and that \u201cGermany [could] perhaps be struck most effectively, and with the most lasting results on the peace of the world through her allies, and particularly through Turkey.\u201d8 Thus, within weeks of the outbreak of war, British attention turned east.\nAt the end of August 1914, Churchill formally requested that Secretary of State for War Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener organize a group of naval and military officers to plan for the seizure of the Gallipoli Peninsula, \u201cwith a view to admitting a British Fleet to the Sea of Marmara\u201d and eventually knocking Turkey out of the war.9 Representatives of the War Office and the Admiralty met and concluded that an attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula was not a militarily feasible operation.10 Director of Military Operations Major General Charles Callwell11 presciently observed that a campaign in Gallipoli was \u201clikely to prove an extremely difficult operation of war.\u201d12 He proffered that an operation in the Dardanelles would require a force of not less than 60,000, with strong siege artillery, echeloned into Turkey in two large waves.13 Kitchener also disagreed with opening a second front, but for different reasons. He was reluctant to divert troops from the continent, which he viewed as the primary focus of effort for the British.\nKitchener further assumed that once news of the arrival of the British fleet reached Constantinople, the entire Turkish army in Thrace would retreat, leaving Turkey to British control.22 Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, argued that once the fleet moved through the Dardanelles, \u201ca coup d\u2019\u00e9tat"}

Their top three: Efficiency, autonomy and being a part of the team. \u201cThe organizations that best promote these traits will and enable high performers to thrive,\u201d says Christina Janzer at Slack.\nWhat do the Sci-Fi team leaders know about team building that we don\u2019t? We couldn\u2019t call Captains Kirk, Picard, Reynolds, or Drummer because they are fictional characters. So we called some present-day real-life humans who have made a study of team building.\nThese are their top ten traits of high-performing teams.\nOne thing about space ships: Everyone knows the mission. Explore new worlds? Save the universe from a destructive life form? Outrun a post-apocalyptic police state? Everyone knows why they are on the ship, where the ship is going, and for what purpose.\nOften, though, experts tell us, managers assume the team knows the mission better than they actually do.\nMeasure productivity all you want, tweak the workspace, take weekend forays into the woods for team building. But if you never talk about what you are doing and why, your team won\u2019t get on board to go to the ends of the universe with you.\nEveryone worries about the day the machines will achieve sentience. What you should worry about instead is the day your team achieves it.\nYou have seen it in science fiction. The crews of Serenity and Enterprise know they are a team. The individuals identify as crewmembers and constantly consider how their actions affect the rest of the crew. They don\u2019t need their leader to be perfect. They need him to fulfil his role as team captain.\nDoes everyone like and respect Captain Kirk? Probably not. But if he does his job, they can focus on engineering or science. Does everyone trust Jayne Cobb on Serenity? Not completely. But they all \u2014 even Cobb \u2014 know their survival depends on him fulfilling his role. When the team is bigger than any individual, it all works.\nA key element of a team, according to Elzinga, is that there is a sense among its members that they are, \u201cgoing on a journey together.\u201d Not only in the \u201cTo boldly go where no man has gone before\u201d sense but also in the Bruce Tuckman theory of group dynamics sense.\n\u201cThe team knows it is in the process of \u2018forming, norming, storming, performing',\u201d says Elzing, quoting from the well-known Tuckman theory. \u201cIt has taken on the job of its own introspection. It accepts responsibility for becoming a better team.\u201d And part of this"}

Who were the protesters and what were their goals? At the barricades in central Kiev there were Ukrainian and EU flags, as well as portraits of the poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), considered as a spiritual father of Ukrainian identity, and of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) who was, depending on your point of view, either a great patriot or a Nazi collaborator. And there were pictures of five Ukrainian activists, treated as martyrs after they were killed during the clashes in Grushevsky Street.\nMaidan Nezalezhnosti, Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the epicentre of the protests that had been taking place across Ukraine for three months, was filled with tents pitched by sympathisers from every part of the country: from Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, the strongholds of nationalism, but also from Lugansk and Donetsk, the big cities of the industrial east, which have always felt close to Russia. Cossacks wore their traditional costume. Women brought black bread and ham to the men standing guard. There was a pervasive smell of tea, cabbage soup and wood fires. During the week, the few thousand activists went about their day-to-day business; on Sundays, tens of thousands came to hear speeches by opposition leaders, pray and sing the national anthem, tirelessly.\nThe protest movement emerged in November last year, after Yanukovych suspended negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union (1). Independence Square was gradually transformed. The first to arrive were a few thousand pro-European partisans, but as repression began the square became a symbol of revolt against a corrupt and mercenary political system for many others \u2014 initially a revolt against the Yanukovych system, but also a rejection of the opposition parties, out of their depth in this crisis.\nThe involvement of several nationalist groups \u2014 a small but highly visible presence \u2014 and of ultra-radical, non-democratic movements without European sympathies has produced different reactions. Their presence was used actively by Russia, and to some extent by Yanukovych\u2019s government, to discredit the movement. But it also raised fears of a possible takeover of Independence Square by the far right \u2014 even though a popular movement was behind the protests and any attempt to categorise it in political terms would be an over-simplification.\nThe far right is largely modelled on the nationalist movement that developed from the 1920s, when most of what is now Ukraine was divided between Poland and Soviet Russia. From the start it was shaped by a variety of influences: Italian fascism, the partial collaboration \u2014 for pragmatic or ideological reasons \u2014 of some of its representatives (such as Bandera) with Nazi Germany, the participation of several Ukrainian battalions in the massacre of Jewish and Polish civilians during the second world war.\nPolitical scientist Andreas Umland, who teaches at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said: \u201cThere are no objective historical accounts of Bandera\u2019s [career].

However, Air Force officials said the bulk of the $86 million added to the fiscal 1999 Defense appropriations bill to fix these problems will be spent on upgrading the plane's communications equipment and Defensive Management System.\nSix of nine existing bombers have been modified and upgraded to what is known as a Block 30 configuration, the most up-to-date configuration that incorporates all the latest technological advances, said a spokesman for the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The other three aircraft are configured in a Block 20 configuration, which provides minimal combat capability, and they are not scheduled to reach Block 30 status until July 2000.\nIn the early years of the stealth bomber program, many observers formed an opinion about the aircraft's capabilities by looking at Block 10 trainer versions, which no longer exist, Zelinski said.\nLt.

Most in the crowd expected to hear him concede defeat for his nation. After all, thousands of American-led coalition forces were sweeping through Iraq. Kunfuth held up what he said was a bulletin from Reuters news service.\n\"The Americans,\" he read, \"have accidentally fired a nuclear missile into British forces, killing seven.\"\nA stunned silence immediately overcame the room. Then Kunfuth shouted \"April Fool's!\"\nDespite a few such enormously inappropriate and maladroit examples, the prank played to salute the first day of April remains an honored tradition through most of the world.\nThe origins of April Fool's Day go back, some say, to 16th Century France, others say, further. In some accounts, the day of trickery is tied to a rite of spring, in others to the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. In 1983, an Associated Press story attempted to set the record straight, quoting Joseph Boskin, a history professor at Boston University, who had researched the subject.\nHe said that the practice began during the reign of Roman emperor Constantine, when his court's jesters and fools claimed they could do a better job of running the empire. Constantine allowed a jester named Kugel to be king for a day. Kugel passed an edict calling for nothing but absurdity on that day, and the custom became an annual event. Shortly after the AP story ran, it came to light that Professor Boskin was a prankster and the explanation was just one more April Fool's Day prank.\nAlex Boese (pronounced burr-za), on the other hand, is a historian of hoaxes. He has collected scores of them in his 2002 book, \"Museum of Hoaxes,\" and his Web site www.museumofhoaxes.com. He has recently published \"Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other BS.\"\n\"When I was a grad student in history at the University of California San Diego,\" he said. \"I'd read references to hoaxes and pranks, track them down and make notes on them. Then I started going through microfilm for various newspapers looking at the April 1 editions going back into the 19th Century. You have to go through the whole week though, because the hoax isn't always identified as such right away.\"\nBoese's research turned up an announcement in the April 1, 1878, edition of the New York Graphic newspaper, that Thomas Edison had invented a machine able to transform soil directly into cereal and water directly into wine, thereby ending world hunger. Newspapers throughout America copied the article, heaping lavish praise on Edison.\nThe Buffalo Commercial Advertiser was particularly effusive in its praise, waxing eloquent about Edison's brilliance in a long editorial. A few days later, the Graphic reprinted the Advertiser's editorial in full, placing above it a simple, triumphant headline: \"They Bite!\"\nBoese said he thinks that prank worked because Edison had invented the phonograph just the year before, and the nation thought he was a miracle-worker."}

{"idx": "2748", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Press reports indicate that National Security Advisor John Bolton wants the United States to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and that he will inform the Russians of this when he visits Moscow October 22-23. Washington certainly has grounds for withdrawal: Russia is violating the agreement. But doing so now would be a mistake.\nRonald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the INF Treaty, which banned all U.S. and Soviet land-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The landmark agreement resulted in the destruction of nearly 2,700 missiles as well as their launchers and gave a boost to the broader U.S.-Soviet relationship as the Cold War wound down.\nConcern about the treaty\u2019s future arose in 2014, when the Obama administration charged Russia with violating the treaty by testing a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile of intermediate range. Trump administration officials in 2017 charged that Russia had begun deploying the missile, known as the 9M729.\nThe Obama administration and, at least initially, the Trump administration set the goal of bringing Russia back into compliance. In December 2017, Washington announced an \u201cintegrated strategy\u201d to press Moscow to return to compliance.\nSo far, the strategy does not seem to have worked.\nBolton\u2019s position comes as no surprise. He views arms control with disdain. He has long called for withdrawal from the INF Treaty, was a driving force behind the U.S. decision in 2001 to leave the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and opposed the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.\nRussia\u2019s failure to correct the violation gives justifiable grounds for leaving the treaty. But is it the smart thing to do now?\nFirst, the United States will get the blame for killing the treaty. Moscow has vigorously denied the U.S. charge and claims the United States is in fact the one in violation. U.S. evidence of the Russian violation is highly classified, so the public debate will devolve into an exchange of charges, counter-charges, and denials. Given the low credibility of the Trump administration, Washington will have a hard time winning that debate.\nSecond, once the United States withdraws from the treaty, there is no reason for Russia to even pretend it is observing the limits. Moscow will be free to deploy the 9M729 cruise missile, and an intermediate-range ballistic missile if it wants, without any restraint.\nThird, the U.S. decision will prove controversial with European allies and others who continue to see value in the treaty. It\u2019s hard to feel too much sympathy; no European leader has raised a public stink with the Kremlin about the Russian violation, and there\u2019s little to suggest the violation was protested much in private at high levels. Still, this is the kind of question where the U.S. position would benefit from alliance solidarity.\nFourth, the United States currently has no missile that it could quickly deploy to match the Russians. The \u201cintegrated strategy\u201d included a treaty-compliant research and development program for a U.S. intermediate-range missile (development is allowed short of flight-testing), but it provided little money.\nEven if the Pentagon were to build the missile, however, a big question remains: Where could the United States put it?

UCLA piled up 439 yards on an afternoon that coach Chip Kelly\u2019s playcalling was dynamic, tailback Joshua Kelley running behind the sturdy blocking of a three-tight-end set for the game\u2019s first touchdown.\nSpeight easily compiled his best day as a Bruin, completing 26 of 35 passes for 335 yards and two touchdowns with one interception that came on a tipped pass. Tight end Caleb Wilson snagged 11 of those passes for a season-high 164 yards and two touchdowns.\nUCLA endured many of the same bugaboos that have hurt it since the season opener. Mo Osling ran into a punt returner. The run defense yielded 281 yards. One Bruins drive in Arizona State territory ended in a failed fourth-down conversion when a guard fell and another on the Speight pass that was tipped and intercepted by cornerback Chase Lucas.\nThe Bruins helped themselves late in the second quarter when cornerback Darnay Holmes intercepted a Manny Wilkins pass intended for receiver N\u2019Keal Harry and ran it back 31 yards for a touchdown.\nBut the 14-10 lead that Holmes\u2019 highlight provided was short-lived. Wilkins immediately guided the Sun Devils (6-4, 4-3) on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended with his five-yard touchdown pass to Nick Ralston with 58 seconds left before halftime.\nUCLA played catch-up for the rest of the game.\nThe Bruins had a chance to take the lead early in the fourth quarter on a drive that ended when Kelly elected to punt instead of going for it on fourth and five from Arizona State\u2019s 40-yard line.\nThe Bruins appeared to be sunk when Arizona State proceeded to drain more than eight minutes off the clock, Wilkins reaching the ball over the goal line for a one-yard touchdown that gave Arizona State a 31-21 lead with only 3 minutes 56 seconds left.\nThat\u2019s when Speight showed why Kelly had given him the start despite freshman Dorian Thompson-Robinson having fully recovered from the injury that sidelined him last weekend against Oregon.

They are between the ages of 11 and 17. Warren County could only find placements for two children within their community and the other three were placed in Clark, Lawrence and Montgomery counties.\nThese are a few examples that illustrate how Warren County is struggling with the hard facts that they are having to permanently terminate parental rights of those who are lost to opioids and that they are having to place the children in other counties. This happens partly Because there are only 50 licensed foster care homes in Warren County which has a population of 246,000 residents.\nChildren Services is hoping that the county will respond to the dire need for more foster homes and open their houses and hearts this holiday season. Warren County, like Ohio, is in the grip of what is arguably the worst epidemic ever. Approximately 60 percent of the estimated 220 children in the agency\u2019s custody are placed outside of the county due to a limited number of residential and group homes. The out-of-county placements create a whole new set of issues for children, families, and county workers.\nWorkers are spending a considerable amount of time grappling with the unique challenges of either driving to visit the children in various counties or having to arrange for the children to be brought to the county for two-hour weekly visits to connect with their parents and siblings.\nIf the children remained in Warren County, they could maintain connections to their families, school friends and communities without any interruptions in the services they need and the activities they participate in.\nWarren County Children Services Director, Susan Walther, believes there are strong benefits to keeping children within the county and negatives when they are removed from their homes, neighborhoods, schools, activities, and communities.\nMoving the children out of county may seem to be a drastic measure but one of the effects of the opiate epidemic is that it has further complicated the child welfare system. Children Service is not seeing parents who are able to get clean and stable to bring their children home. Statistics show that 85 percent of addicted patients will relapse within one year of recovery. That\u2019s why children are often being placed into the custody of a kinship caregiver or placed for adoption.\nOverall, Walther believes the agency has coped very well with the opioid crisis by focusing on permanency for children and by working with families to seek out relative placements. Since 2010, there has been a 62 percent increase in children being placed with relatives statewide.\nThe primary need is for children aged 7-17. Foster parents need to be over the age of 21, have an available bed in their home and be willing to invest in the future of a child in need. Training and financial reimbursement are provided.\nChildren Services partners with many local service providers to help foster parents manage educational, medical, behavioral, and special needs of the children under their care. This team approach supports differing perspectives and has consistently promoted the best interest of children.

He knew other house hunters would have the trophy home in their sights, so he had to pull the trigger fast.\nJosh had been pre-qualified by his VA specialty lender, Veterans First; therefore, he already knew that the home was in his price range. He quickly made an offer that was accepted by the builder/owner. The purchase price exceeded the VA loan limits of $417,000 in his county by about $16,000, so Josh was concerned that maybe that would present a problem.\nA common misconception about the VA loan limit\u2014$417,000 or more in high-cost counties\u2014is that it\u2019s the highest loan amount a borrower can obtain using their benefit. On the contrary, an eligible, qualified individual can obtain a loan above the county VA loan limit as long as a down payment is provided to secure the portion of the loan amount not guaranteed by the VA.\nIn Josh\u2019s case, he ended up paying only about a 1.4% down payment to purchase the large home. A conventional loan in today\u2019s market may require borrowers to pay 20% or more in down payment. By using his VA loan benefit, Josh avoided having to pay up to $80,000 in cash out-of-pocket while and avoiding private monthly mortgage insurance premiums that come with other low-down-payment loan programs.\nSince November 2013, Josh and his family have been enjoying their big rustic house in Boise, Idaho. And, Josh has plenty of free space on his walls for more big game trophies.\nFor more information on buying a big home with a VA loan, call an experienced VA-approved lender."}

China Telecom operates the country\u2019s largest fixed-line network and is a relative newcomer to the mobile market.\nChina Telecom\u2019s shares, which have risen by about a fifth this year, extended earlier gains after Reuters exclusively reported the plan, rising as much as 5.5 percent to an intraday high of HK$4.95 and outperforming the Hang Seng Index\u2019s 1 percent gain.\nSeparately on Wednesday, China Telecom said in a statement that its president and chief operating officer, Shang Bing, had resigned to become deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.\nChina has 896 million mobile phone users \u2014 bigger than the entire population of Europe. Its three telecommunications operators are China Mobile Ltd, China Unicom and China Telecom.\nSo far, China Unicom is the only operator to offer the iPhone after signing a three-year agreement with Apple in 2009. Its deal with Apple is not based on a revenue-sharing scheme, unlike some operators in other countries. For example, in the United States, Apple has a revenue-sharing agreement with AT&T Inc on iPhone sales.\nIn May, China Telecom\u2019s chairman, Wang Xiaochu, told a news conference that the carrier had contacted Apple to launch the iPhone based on CDMA (code division multiple access) technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s expected to happen this year. China Telecom already has the required technology and it all hinges on the content of the agreement. As we all know, it\u2019s not easy to negotiate with Apple,\u201d a source close to the company, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\nChina Telecom is expected to introduce the iPhone in November, said another source, declining to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\nOfficials with China Telecom declined to comment, while Apple officials were not immediately available for comment.\nIn June, a media report said bigger rival China Mobile could offer iPhones from September, although analysts said it was unlikely that Apple would support the carrier\u2019s TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous code division multiple access) technology.\nA more likely scenario was for Apple to support China Mobile\u2019s 4G LTE (long-term evolution) technology, which would only be available either in late 2012 or 2013, they said.\nIf that is the case, China Telecom would be next in line to offer iPhones."}

Whether it is adhered to in 100 per cent of cases or 99 per cent of cases is an open question.\nDamodaran: In the Economic Survey chapter on demonetisation, your prognosis of growth following it is not very sanguine or bullish. Isn\u2019t it different from the government\u2019s as well as the RBI\u2019s views?\nIn this post-truth world that we live in, one response is how do you cope with this post-truth. Surely, another response must be that we resist this post-truth. It was really important for at least the team that we come out with a completely fair and balanced assessment.

{"idx": "2775", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If you want to wind up a Pole of a certain age, there is no more reliable means than quoting the old myth about Polish lancers charging at German panzer divisions in the second world war.\nThe story feeds a stereotype about Polish men being hopelessly romantic, hopelessly moustachioed idiots who would actually gallop their horses at big steel tanks.\nEven this newspaper fell into the trap less than two years ago, when a columnist described the mythical charge as \"the most romantic and idiotic act of suicide of modern war\". We had to append a speedy correction admitting that we had \"repeated a myth of the second world war, fostered by Nazi propagandists\".\nThe most likely origin of the legend is a skirmish at the Pomeranian village of Krojanty on the first day of the German invasion, 1 September 1939. Polish lancers, whose units had still not been motorised, did indeed charge a Wehrmacht infantry battalion but were forced to retreat under heavy machine gun fire. By the time German and Italian war correspondents got there, some tanks had arrived and they joined the dots themselves.\nThe story was used first by the Nazi propaganda machine and then by its Soviet counterpart, to portray Polish officers (who were killed by Stalin en masse the next year) as absurdly careless about the lives of their troops.\nWhat is most irritating to Poles about this particular fable is that it trivialises the Polish contribution to the allied war effort, reducing it to a single moment of whimsy.\nIn fact, as the war historian and Times columnist Ben Macintyre recently wrote: \"The Polish contribution to allied victory in the Second World War was extraordinary, perhaps even decisive, but for many years it was disgracefully played down, obscured by the politics of the Cold War.\"\nMacintyre points out that one in 12 Battle of Britain pilots was a Pole, and some 250,000 Polish troops served with British forces, while a huge, largely forgotten role was also played by the Polish resistance.\nThe Home Army, as it was called, is thought to have been about 400,000-strong, and inflicted serious damage on German occupying forces throughout the war. The French resistance only grew to that size after D-Day, when the tide had already turned. But while the French were able to lead the liberation parade into Paris, the Polish Home Army and its memory were crushed by the country's new Soviet occupiers, with western acquiescence."}

His organization, Traditional Ecological Knowledge Elders Group, wants an herbicide banned in traditional First Nations territory.\nWhen Raymond Owl hunts and forages for medicines in woodlands around his Northern Ontario First Nation, he routinely finds blistering, withered plants and seldom sees game. The forest is part of a tract of land sprayed with glyphosate, the active ingredient in an herbicide used to expedite the growth of coniferous trees after clear-cutting. And Mr. Owl argues the effects of the chemical impede traditions on which his culture hinges.\n\"You don't want to take a chance on it,\" he said. \"If you go up the road here where they sprayed, everything is black, like a forest fire.\"\nNot only does the forest near Sagamok Anishnawbek First Nation \u2013 about an hour's drive southwest of Sudbury \u2013 yield fewer fruits, he said, but his people are reluctant to take from the bush in case the flora and fauna are contaminated. Mr. Owl refuses to harvest in these affected areas; and for roughly two decades, he's noticed marked changes to the environment.\n\"If the forests weren't sprayed, we would harvest as we please without any fear.\"\nMr. Owl, 73, co-founded an organization called the Traditional Ecological Knowledge Elders Group (TEK) to protect a large swath of forest along the northern shore of Lake Huron between Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury that totals about 5.1 million hectares. TEK says glyphosate is harming their traditional territories, ways of life and consequently infringing upon their vested rights as First Nation people.\nAfter two years of sending letters to provincial and federal officials, TEK organized a peaceful demonstration of about 50 First Nation elders and activists on Parliament Hill. They held placards emphasizing their discontent with what they consider a \"poison.\"\nThey want the department to abolish the use of glyphosate in their territories. TEK has been pressing Health Canada and the Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) for a moratorium. But the group has made little headway.\nCalls placed to forestry and helicopter companies in early September revealed that glyphosate was used in the area during the spraying season. And MNRF said it was considering the moratorium request, but never followed up with a timely decision after telling The Globe and Mail it would.\nGlyphosate was designed by Monsanto in the early 1970s and is the most widely sold herbicide in Canada. The agent is deployed by air over portions of Ontario forests to eliminate unwanted plants \u2013 like underbrush \u2013 from stifling the early growth of coniferous trees, which are harvested for commercial use.\nAnd it is quite effective. That's because it's systemic (it impacts the entire plant), said Paleah Black Moher, head of environmental exposures at CAREX Canada, a surveillance project studying exposures to known and suspected carcinogens in the country. \"How it works is essentially stopping the enzyme that is responsible for producing amino acids, which are the basic building blocks of growth.

{"idx": "2785", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Do you need to be a vegetarian to lead a healthy life?\nCan a vegetarian diet add years to your life?\nA new study suggests the answer could be yes. After examining the health records of 73,308 people for an average of nearly six years, researchers discovered that vegetarians were 12% less likely to die during that period than people who ate meat more than once a week.\nResearchers from Loma Linda University in California recruited members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, who are strongly encouraged to follow a vegetarian diet. As such, 52% of the sample fit into one of four categories of vegetarians: 7.6% were vegans (avoiding eggs, dairy, fish and other meat), 28.9% were lacto-ovo-vegetarians (who ate dairy and eggs but avoided fish and meat), 9.8% were pesco-vegetarians (who ate eggs, dairy and fish but avoided other meat) and 5.5% were semi-vegetarians (who ate eggs, dairy and fish regularly but ate other meats only once a week). The remaining 48.2% of people in the study were classified as nonvegetarians.\nFor the vegetarians in the study, the diets were not a passing fad. Pesco-vegetarians had been following that diet for 19 years, on average, and vegans had cut out meat, dairy and eggs for 21 years, on average. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians had not eaten fish or meat for 39 years, on average.\nDifferent types of vegetarian diets produced different types of benefits. For instance, compared with nonvegetarians, those who followed a pesco-vegetarian diet reduced their risk of death from any cause by 19% during the course of the study. In men, the diet also reduced the risk of death due to cardiovascular causes by 34%; in women, it reduced the risk of death due to ischemic heart disease by 49%.\nMen and women who followed a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet reduced their risk of death from any cause by 9% during the study period. And vegan men were 55% less likely to die as a result of ischemic heart disease, 42% less likely to die of cardiovascular causes and 28% less likely to die of any cause compared to nonvegetarians.\nThe results were published online Monday by the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\nNone of this proves that vegetarians live longer than nonvegetarians \u2013 the study volunteers will have to be tracked longer to see if that is true. But the results to date are certainly consistent with the idea.\nThe study authors speculate that vegetarians had fewer life-threatening health problems because they aet more fiber and avoided saturated fat, factors known to boost heart health. But the researchers didn't know why men were so much more likely to benefit than women.\n\"The biological effect of dietary factors on mortality may be different in men and women,\" they speculated. More studies are needed to figure this out, they said.\nAlso puzzling was why the vegetarian Seventh-day Adventists did better than a group of British vegetarians followed as part of another long-term study. The American vegetarians ate more fiber and vitamin C than their British counterparts, but it's not clear that this explains the difference, they noted.\nDoes this mean you should become a vegetarian?

One of them allows you to remotely root any WeMo device, and the other one allow you to do cross-site scripting, and execute arbitrary code inside the Android app for WeMo devices,\u201d said Tenaglia, speaking to CSO Online on Friday.\nThe WeMo product range launched in 2012 and today includes several devices, including connected room heaters, coffee makers and humidifiers. Belkin claims to have sold 1.5 million devices to date.\nPrior to the demonstration on Friday, the researchers disclosed these vulnerabilities, with Belkin issuing updates for the firmware (10884 and 10885) for the SQL injection vulnerability in November, and for the mobile application (now version 1.15.2) in August.\nThe SQL injection vulnerability led the Invincea Labs duo to carry out a \u201ctextbook\u201d SQL injection attack.\nIn this case, researchers found they could inject data into the databases used by the WeMo devices, to take control of the Belkin WeMo Switch device (*the flaw is also presence in WeMo-compatible Crock-Pot, and most likely in other WeMo devices too).\nThe WeMo mobile app, which is available for iOS and Android, lets users create \u2018rules\u2019 to control Belkin devices. As one example, one such rule may be for a connected lamp to automatically turn off each night at 10pm.\nThese rules can be configured on the app and pushed to the Belkin WeMo device over the local network as an SQLite database file. On receiving the file, the device decompresses it and uses a set of SQL queries to pull rule information from the new database and update its in-memory rules.\nTenaglia and Tanen found an SQL injection flaw in this configuration, potentially enabling attackers to write an arbitrary file on the device in a location of their choosing, and for the device to execute on the file.\nThere is no authentication or encryption used for device communication over the local network, meaning anyone \u2013 and any device - can send the malicious SQLite file to the Belkin device assuming they are on the same network.\nTenaglia and Tanen exploited the flaw to create a second SQLite database on the device that would be interpreted as a shell script by the command interpreter. They placed the file in a specific location from where it would be automatically executed by the device's network subsystem on restarting the device.\nOn restart, they gained root control over the device and could run Telnet (although they say hackers could run anything at this point),). Tenaglia and Tanen said at the conference that this technique could be used for DDoS attack or causing the IoT product to malfunction, such as overheat.\n\"We could easily run Mirai on this\u2026.

High performance SSDs routinely sell at 50 cents per gigabyte, and value SSDs sometimes dip into the 35 cents per gigabyte range.\nWe can point our finger at several reason why SSDs have become so cheap over the last two years. Lithography shrinks have reduced the cost of flash, higher adaption rates are also a factor. Another reason is a good 'ol price war between FabCos (Fab Companies: SSD makers that also produce NAND flash - Crucial, Intel, Samsung, SanDisk and Toshiba/OCZ Storage Solutions) with guaranteed access to flash pulled the pin on the grenade and steadily decreased the cost of consumer SSDs.\nLower retail prices also mean lower margins per retail product sold.

All rising executives are opposed to it.\nCertainly you also have been opposed to deadwood all your life, even if you were among us executives who didn't rise very far.\nThen one day you're past 60 and aren't invited to the meeting in which the new boss discusses deadwood.\nInstead, you sit alone in your office, hyperventilating and asking yourself, \"Am I being classified as deadwood? Is the ax aimed at me?\"\nYou don't want to quit. You find work an essential part of your life, meaning that you can't pay the mortgage without it, having invested in oil just before oil prices collapsed.\nIf you've been classified as deadwood, you'll know the signs. Suddenly you'll be moved to another office, which is next to the men's room and so small that you go outside to put on your coat. Your parking space is transferred to an adjoining county and you share with three others a secretary who takes dictation at the approximate speed that messages formerly were chipped onto stone.\nHow does one who wants to keep working avoid becoming deadwood after 60? If heads must roll, must one of them be yours when the new boss says, \"We need young, aggressive people with fresh ideas\"?\nIt isn't easy. Once you had fresh ideas, but that was in the 1950s. You can dye your hair, if you have any left. If you have no physical disabilities, you can walk fast in the office, even when not going anyplace, while trying not to pant. You can look busy, even when you're doing nothing, and say things like \"Oh, wow!\" and \"Go for it!\" instead of using colorful World War II expressions like \"Hubba, hubba.\"\nYou can even avoid, with great difficulty, offering your opinion when it's not solicited and starting your sentences with \"From my long experience . . .\"\nBut from my long experience, I can tell you that nothing helps. When they classify you as deadwood, you're dead.\nMy only suggestion for avoiding deadwood status is to own a company, if at all possible. Then you're never called deadwood. You're called \"Sir\" or \"Boss,\" and you're allowed to keep your office.\nUnfortunately, many of us are never able to own a company. In a few cases, you can overcome the handicap. You can marry somebody who does."}

Will Iron Man, Captain America and the remaining crew be able to put a stop to the Mad Titan? Can they bring back Spider-Man, Black Panther and Doctor Strange?\nDisney and Marvel have kept remarkably quiet on the upcoming sequel, but small details have emerged thanks to trailers, chatty actors and the occasional leaked set photo. Here\u2019s everything we know about the fourth Avengers movie.\nAvengers: Endgame reaches cinemas on 26 April 2019, just over a year after Infinity War was released.\nThe first official trailer for Avengers: End Game was released last year and featured Iron Man stranded in space, Captain America searching for a way to defeat Thanos, and Ant-Man hoping to get into the Avengers' facility. Watch the trailer at the top of this article, and click through our breakdown of it below.\nThose fans were proven right following the release of Captain Marvel, when another new trailer dropped. Interestingly, Tony Stark is pictured back on Earth and Brie Larson's Carol Danvers facing off against Thor (not in a fight, but a stare off).\nSoon after, one final trailer was released, featuring the superhero team heading off to fight Thanos, as well as a first look at the Mad Titan post-The Snappening. The events depicted seem to still be from early in Endgame, as the team are not wearing their white Quantum Suits (more on those later).\nA clip from the film, showing Captain Marvel, Captain America and Black Widow coming up with a plan to defeat Thanos has also been revealed \u2013 much of the footage was previously seen in the trailer.\nFor quite some time, no-one knew what the fourth Avengers movie would be called. First, the Russo Brothers \u2013 who directed Infinity War and return for the sequel \u2013 confirmed that the movie would not be given the subtitle Infinity Gauntlet.\nThey initially claimed that the title was not said during Infinity War, which ruled out the title Endgame as the phrase was used during Infinity War. As we now know, the brothers were hiding the real title all along.\nAsked later about the length of the film, the Russo brothers said that the run-time was still around the three-hour mark, with reports later claiming Marvel were considering having an interval in the film.\nThe film was listed as three hours and two minutes long on AMC theatres\u2019s official website, with the time later being removed from the webpage for the film. That length has since been confirmed by Marvel.\nThanks to License Global magazine \u2013 the same publication that offered the world first synopsis for Infinity War \u2013 we have a short, very non-spoilery summary of what to expect.\nChris Evans has confirmed that he\u2019s hanging up the shield after the next Avengers, strongly implying that Captain America may die. And while the actor has said that his character\u2019s death is not a sure-fire thing, fans are expecting the honourable Captain to perish at some stage.\nAnother possibility is Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr has been demanding increasing pay for each Avengers outing, with some estimates putting his salary for Infinity War and Endgame at around $200 million. Can the studio afford to keep paying the actor such massive amounts? Considering Infinity War grossed upwards of \u00a32 billion, they certainly can \u2013 but do they want to?

Instead, it wants to turn its failure to be relevant into a case of victimhood.\nMy heart bleeds for Opera.\nI have no love for Microsoft. I think that's clear from my writings. But I respect it as a competitor and despise companies that ask governments to rectify their own inability to build products that anyone wants.\nIn its complaint to the European Commission, Opera said Microsoft hurts it and other makers of browsers because the protocols it uses in its Internet Explorer deviate from the standard protocols that define how Web sites work with browsers.\nBecause Internet Explorer is distributed with the ubiquitous Windows operating system, it has an insurmountable edge in market share, the complaint said. That forces Web-site owners to design their sites for Internet Explorer's particularities instead of the standard protocols, Opera said. That leaves alternative browsers, which Opera said adhere to the standards, at a disadvantage.\nWith all due respect to Opera, though there are sites that only seem to understand Internet Explorer (written by developers who barely deserve to carry that title, since all they seem to know how to do is piece together applications using Microsoft's tinkertoy tools), the number is so few as to be almost meaningless. I can't remember the last time I used one. In fact, if anything I've been forced into using Firefox because CNET only works with it (instead of my preferred Safari browser).\nSuch is life. Get on with it.\nMary Jo Foley is right: trying to set web standards through litigation like this is ill-advised and will likely result in consequence no one, including Opera, wants.\nThis isn't a case of Microsoft against Opera. It's a case of Microsoft against the industry, with equally powerful players (like Google) on the other side. Google doesn't need the EC to help it out. It has something called competition going for it. Regulation is a distraction.\nCould it be that Opera emasculated its own efforts long ago by trying to sell a browser into a market that had decided that browsers are free? It changed this policy, but perhaps it would have been relevant had it not waited so long. Opera provides a good browser but, let's face it, there is no room in the market for a small independent browser.

{"idx": "2813", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Like Big Data? How about container-based virtualization? MapR thinks these are two great tastes that taste great together, and is introducing the Converged Data Platform for Docker to make it all work.\nIf virtual machines are what made the cloud possible, then containers are what will make the cloud elegant. Think about it this way: as a computing entity, an entire virtual machine is a pretty coarse, hefty resource if what you're really looking to do is distribute a single application.\nContainers, on the other hand, let you deploy an application, its dependencies and its environment in an efficient vessel that fits pretty tightly around them and can be pushed into both cloud and on-premises environments very efficiently.\nThis notion of easily deployed applications is pretty meaningful to Hadoop ecosystem vendor MapR. That's because its \"Converged Data Platform,\" beyond go-to-market rhetoric, focuses on the use of clusters running MapR-FS (an HDFS-compatible File System), MapR-DB (an HBase-compatible NoSQL database) and MapR Streams (a Kafka-compatible streaming data engine) as distributed application platforms.\nIn other words, instead of setting up a cluster running a full Hadoop/Spark distribution, with all of its companion projects and tools, MapR targets a scenario where just the file system, database and streaming data infrastructure are in place, serving as the core runtime for mission-critical applications (MapR calls them \"converged apps\") that run right on top.\nApps running on these clusters sure sound like they'd be perfect for containerized operation, don't they? Yes, but there's a catch. To make the persistent resources of a Hadoop cluster be visible to apps running in containers, you need some hooks, from the latter to the former. And so MapR has attacked that very problem.\nWith the Converged Data Platform for Docker, which MapR is announcing this morning, running containerized apps on MapR clusters can apparently work quite well. The combination of a POSIX client for containers and the new MapR Persistent Application Client Container (PACC) allow converged apps in Docker containers to see running MapR clusters, just as if the apps were deployed directly to a virtual machine or physical server.\nContainerized converged apps can run on-premises or in the cloud. And the MapR clusters they target can run in either environment as well. You can even mix and match, for hybrid environments (for example, having the container running on-premises against a cloud-based MapR cluster, or vice-versa.\nWith this release, MapR is making clear that its model is very different from Cloudera and Hortonworks. Rather than selling a mere customized Hadoop distribution, the company instead sees itself as selling an enterprise application platform for data-centric computing. Yes, that platform happens to be based on Hadoop and YARN and, yes, it mixes in proprietary technology.\nBut whereas at one time, it seemed like that cocktail of open source and home-grown Hadoop technology was the story, now that approach really seems like a means to an end. The real goal for MapR is to be an Enterprise data company. Big Data, small data, streaming data, the cloud -- and now containers -- are pieces of that puzzle. But MapR isn't selling the pieces, it's integrating them, and aims to help its customers do likewise."}

But North Carolina, like Illinois, Maryland, Texas and Virginia, has steadfastly clung to the old game of politicians manipulating election maps to keep their party and themselves in power.\nIn North Carolina, reformers have challenged the Republican legislative leadership in no fewer than seven different lawsuits. In response, federal courts have ordered two congressional districts and 28 legislative districts redrawn to correct for what the courts decided were illegal, racially discriminatory maps imposed by the Republican-led legislature in 2011.\nThe big issue now is partisan gerrymandering \u2013 whether the maps for North Carolina\u2019s 13 congressional districts have been unconstitutionally stacked to favor the Republican slate statewide. A three-judge federal court has already condemned the legislature for drawing maps \u201dwith invidious partisan intent\u201d and thrown out those maps. Now the case, brought by the public interest group Common Cause, goes before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday.\n\u201cWhether it is Democrats or Republicans manipulating election maps, gerrymanders cheat voters out of true representation,\u201d asserts Karen Hobert Flynn, national president of Common Cause. \u201cThe Supreme Court has the opportunity to set a clear standard that will restore a meaningful vote to millions of Americans disenfranchised by gerrymanders in North Carolina, Maryland and across the country.\nA parallel suit is working its way through the North Carolina state courts. Filed by Common Cause and the North Carolina Democratic Party, it also accuses the Republican-dominated legislature of illegally drawing the boundaries of state legislative districts to favor Republicans.\nEqually striking, broad bipartisan coalitions have just recently sponsored bills into the General Assembly to reform how North Carolina will draw its election districts in the future. The most far-reaching calls for establishing a tripartite commission \u2013 Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2013 to take over drawing election maps in 2021. It would bar any plan designed \u201cfor the purpose of favoring a political party, incumbent legislator or Congress member\u201d or based on the use of political or election data in drafting the plan \u2013 key ingredients for rigging election maps.\nSuch bills have surfaced in years past and gone nowhere. What makes this year different is that already, more than half of the 120 members of the lower house have signed on as co-sponsors of the two reform bills, Republicans as well as Democrats. So if a vote were taken, presumably one of those reform bills would pass.\nWhat is impossible to tell, reform advocates say, is whether Republican lawmakers are co-sponsoring reform bills because they fear eventual defeat in the courts and in elections and want to have a hand in drafting new reform laws, or whether the reform bills are simply a tactical ploy that will be buried in committee by the GOP leadership if the Supreme Court allows the current GOP-gerrymandered system to stand.\nWhat is indisputable, however, is the frank admission of partisan gerrymandering by Republican leaders like Rep. David Lewis, chairman of the legislature\u2019s redistricting committee. Lewis has admitted drawing district lines to deliver Republicans a 10-3 majority in the state\u2019s"}

Holman, a fourth generation Oregonian, and former Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, died from the effects of old age on Sept. 3, in Salem. He was born in Portland on June 7, 1914, and was reared in the Molalla area where he attended both grammar and high school. Ralph graduated from the Northwestern School of Law, now Lewis & Clark Law School, in 1937 and was admitted to the practice of law the same year. He practiced in Portland until 1942 when he was inducted into the Navy, serving as a Chief Petty Officer until discharged in 1946. In 1937, he married Louise Mariam Oesch of Portland, who died in 1989. His closest relatives are nephews and nieces. Upon his discharge from the Navy, he joined the law firm of Butler and Jack in Oregon City which, subsequently, became Butler, Jack, Beckett and Holman. In 1950, he was appointed Circuit Judge of Clackamas County by Governor Douglas McKay, in which position he served until he was elected to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1965. While a trial judge, he was a member of a Committee on the Administration of Justice established by the Legislature. As chairman of its subcommittee on Juvenile Law, he was instrumental in the passage of a law permitting the termination of parental rights of parents of abused children, thus making them eligible for adoption. At the request of the other members of the Supreme Court, he drew the plan for establishment of the Oregon Court of Appeals, which was presented to the State Bar Association and which was created by the Legislature. Ralph was a life member of the Board of Trustees of Lewis & Clark College and served as Chairman of the law school budget committee until the law school budget was subsumed into the greater school budget. He was given a distinguished graduate award by Lewis & Clark Law School as well as the Aubrey Watzik award by Lewis & Clark College. The Ralph M. Holman Law Center in Oregon City was dedicated on July 30, 2007. He retired from the Supreme Court in 1980, after serving as a judge for 30 years. At his request, there will be no service.

And then 2005 was the big year in regards to highway funds. We hope that another year would come like that, but the budget pressures are very severe right now.

I know that caused an awful lot of orange barrels, but after the orange barrels leave I think we've changed the face of Dodge City, so I'm very pleased to have played a key role in that.\nAt any rate, then in 2007 we got almost $300,000 for the Ford County Sheriff's Office for addressing and preventing terrorist risks. And $205,000 for the United Methodist Youthville. So we've been working very hard.

But as I was reaching towards its end, I got a little confused. As I have studied Hindi before I had a little bit of confusion with the order of these alphabets. So while I was sitting perplexed, I saw a girl sitting beside my bench, relaxed as she has completed writing. So I asked her if she could show me her paper so that I could copy the alphabets.

By the end of the year, there'll be 70 Drybars across the U.S. and one in Vancouver, B.C., with plans to expand across Canada in 2017.\nThe six-year-old company is on track to improve on its 2015 revenues of $70 million, with a quarter of those sales now coming from its fast-growing line of prettily-packaged styling tools and treatments.\nDrybar's numbers are impressive on their own, but its trajectory is staggering when you consider where founder Alli Webb was just seven years ago: in her 2001 Nissan Xterra, braving Los Angeles traffic to visit clients of her mobile blow dry service Straight at Home.\nIt was later in 2009 that longtime hairstylist Webb, seeing an explosion of interest in her $40 blowouts, enlisted the help of her marketer brother Michael Landau. He agreed to invest $250,000 to open the first Drybar salon in affluent Brentwood, Calif. He was Webb's business partner, and the company's first CEO. Webb and her husband put in their $50,000 savings.\nThankfully, Webb's hunch that women would pay $40 (and $45, since a 2015 price hike) for expertly-applied hot air has proven correct. Drybar has only ever offered styling services -- \"no cuts, no color, just blowouts,\" as its tagline reads. By the time Forbes featured Drybar in a 2012 magazine story, the company was reporting $20 million in annual sales.\n\"We did, to a certain degree, change behavior,\" Webb said. \"I say that with a lot of humility. It's such an easy luxury that can change your day. The awareness for this category really wasn't there before.\"\nIts 250% revenue growth in the intervening years has been in part organic, with demand driving the opening of new Drybars from coast to coast. In New York alone, there are 13, with a 14th planned for Brooklyn's pricey Boerum Hill this year.\nIt's also been thanks to a canny roll-out of products designed to replicate the Drybar experience at home, including a bestselling $195 blow dryer in the brand's signature canary yellow. Women can buy Drybar's goodies at the salons themselves, online, or -- crucially, for both revenues and brand recognition -- at Sephora and Nordstrom .\nThe company's current marketing campaign encourages women to \"extend\" their blowouts, which last three or so days, with $23 dry shampoos and $45 silk pillowcases.\nWebb knows, though, that you can't really fake a Drybar 'do in your bathroom. Nor can you recreate the ambience regular customers have come to expect of the chain: its sunny palette, with vases of yellow roses refreshed weekly; the champagne or coffee offered on arrival along with trays of mini cookies; the subtitled chick flicks playing on flat-screens, their sound drowned out by the drone of hair dryers.\nDrybar's just-launched Extend Your Blowout kit.\n\"There's"}

{"idx": "2837", "prompt": "Continue the following text: For a short time this summer, Florida State was the rumored target of a Southeastern Conference raid on the Atlantic Coast Conference, in the protracted and sometimes absurd realignment that still is reshaping college football's landscape. Ben Haumiller, a proud Seminole alumnus, knew that change was unlikely in the real world. Florida State burned a bridge when it chose the ACC over the SEC in 1992. But on his Xbox 360, FSU was already lacing up in the nation's premier league.\n\"I'm not gonna lie, when people were whispering that Florida State was going to the SEC, you're damn right I started an NCAA 12 dynasty with Florida State in the SEC,\" said Haumiller, taking advantage of a conference realignment feature incorporated in this year's game. \"And oh God, here I am at Alabama, and Georgia, and at Neyland Stadium hearing 'Rocky Top.' I had a blast doing that.\"\nWhen he goes into work, however, the variables and fantasy scenarios are not all fun and games. Haumiller, the producer of EA Sports' NCAA Football series, is also riding the crest of a wave of change, along with athletics directors, television executives and, yes, fans, coaches and players.\nWhether a conference swells to 22 or even 14, as the SEC will next year, the uncertainty in eight major conference memberships has Haumiller's development team building several contingency plans, and facing a nightmare scenario in which the game released in July 2012 doesn't reflect the reality coming in August.\n\"We're going to go as late as we can possibly go to be correct,\" Haumiller said, acknowledging that uncertainties in the departures of Pitt, Syracuse, and West Virginia from the Big East could be resolved after the game enters its alpha state around April or May. So could the desperate, circle-the-wagons alliance of a proposed Mountain West-Conference USA merger, creating a 22-team megaleague to protect the midweek broadcast viability of college football's have-nots.\nAnyone who has ever built a custom schedule in NCAA Football, especially with an independent team, knows why Haumiller is so concerned. The game's scheduling into future simulated seasons requires a deeply complicated logic, much more than simply following the currently announced schedule of a professional league and its predictable rotation of interdivisional matchups. This schedule touches multiple modes of the game also, from the standard Dynasty, to the Online Dynasty, to its Road to Glory singleplayer.\nThere are 120 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision (\"major\" college football) this year, and another three come aboard next year. Creating a realistic national schedule that doesn't send Florida Atlantic to Wyoming for no good reason is tough enough. In divining how 12 and 14-team superconferences, which can't play a full round robin among all their league's members, will protect certain annual rivalries and plot future matchups, a Ouija board is as accurate as any current information.\n\"A 22-team conference is something we've never had to deal with before,\" said Haumiller. \"It would break our code,\" as currently written, he said.\nThe current version of NCAA Football, allows users to manipulate the memberships of all existing conferences, expanding or reducing them to 16 or 6 members, if they wish. Automatic major bowl bids and other scheduling parameters also are incorporated. It was"}

Eat more of them by learning how to cook them in different ways.\nBeans should be a staple in every kitchen. They are nutritious, versatile, hearty, and inexpensive. They can sit on a pantry shelf for months and then suddenly be turned into a delicious meal. Canned beans are convenient, but I am partial to dried beans. I prefer to cook them myself, not only because it\u2019s cheaper but also because there\u2019s something satisfying about a simmering pot of beans filling the house with a steamy aroma and providing leftovers for multiple bean-based meals. You can freeze beans easily, too.\nPre-soaking is optional, though advisable. It cuts down on cooking time, helps beans to keep their uniform shape without splitting, and possibly makes them less gassy. Soaking overnight is ideal, but you can do it for however many hours you have before cooking (usually 8 is recommended).\nIf you\u2019re really in a rush and don\u2019t have a pressure cooker, you can use the quick-soak method. Place rinsed beans in a pot covered with 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil for 1 minute, then turn off heat. Let sit for 1 hour, then start cooking. This will speed up the process considerably.\nThe key to successful stove-top beans is realizing that good beans take a long time. Be patient! There will be moments when you think they\u2019ll never become edible, but then the transformation happens very rapidly.\nRinse 1 lb of dried or pre-soaked beans and place in a heavy pot. Cover with at least 1 inch of water. Add aromatics such as bay leaf, whole garlic cloves, chopped carrots and onion, a ham hock, etc. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a low simmer; you should barely see the water bubble. This is important because it cooks the beans evenly, without them turning to mush. Add salt when the beans are nearly ready.\nThis method is less conventional but the easiest of all. Preheat oven to 325 F. Rinse beans and place in an ovenproof pot (a heavy Dutch oven is ideal). They don\u2019t have to be pre-soaked, although it cuts down on cooking time if you do. Stir in salt and pepper. Cover with at least 1 inch of water. Bring the beans to a boil on the stove, then place in oven. Bake for 75 minutes before checking for doneness.\nSlow cookers provide a steady, even heat that can cook beans to perfection if you have the patience to wait. For this method, it\u2019s best to pre-soak because the cooking time will be long anyway. Place 1 lb soaked beans in the cooker and cover with 2 inches of water. Add 1 tsp salt, pepper, and any other aromatics you may want. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours; start checking after 5 hours. Add the second teaspoon of salt when beans are close to finishing.\nThe fastest method of all, pressure cookers can make dried beans edible in less than an hour. Presoak 1 lb beans in salted water overnight. Transfer the drained beans to pressure cooker. Add aromatics (bay leaf, onion, garlic, carrots) and 8 cups of water. Add 1 tbsp oil to reduce foaming.

Let\u2019s hope so.\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto vowed to battle murder, extortion, kidnapping, and other violent crimes but said little about going after drug traffickers. During its unrivaled 70-year reign that ended in 2000, the PRI was accused of cutting deals with crime syndicates to keep the peace. Although such agreements were corrupt, perhaps corruption is better than the militarized U.S.-backed anti-drug war of Felipe Calder\u00f3n, the current Mexican president. Fatigue with that costly war, which has killed more than 50,000 Mexican civilians in recent years, played a significant role in Mexicans bringing back a venal and autocratic PRI that they had thrown out of office 12 years before.\nBut any president of Mexico must pay heed to the wishes of the colossus of the north, and Washington is already suspicious that Pe\u00f1a Nieto will ease the pressure on drug traffickers and stop taking down cartel chieftains.\nOf course, most Mexicans would be happy if Pe\u00f1a Nieto did exactly that. At the behest of the United States, Calder\u00f3n\u2019s use of the Mexican military and its harsh tactics against the drug lords has merely led to the slaughter of Mexican civilians without putting much of a dent in the long-term flow of drugs into the United States.\nThis militarized bloodbath is causing some in the United States \u2014 even a few government officials \u2014 to privately reassess the failed U.S. war on drugs. As during alcohol prohibition from 1919 to 1933 in the United States, organized crime has been given a big boost; continued demand for the illegal product exists and so do huge profits to be made off excessively high prices that could be charged for the dangers of smuggling it to customers past government authorities.\nMexicans correctly believe that the root of the problem lies in the continued demand for illegal drugs in the United States. If the U.S. government did away with a victimless crime and allowed adults the right to put into their bodies what they wanted, demand for drugs would go up somewhat but the violence would plummet. No one would pay elevated prices to gangsters \u2014 Mexican, Colombian, American, or otherwise \u2014 to traffic legal substances. Society could then treat drug addiction as a medical problem instead of a crime, with education campaigns and treatment programs reducing the long-term demand for drugs. Finally, the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, but that\u2019s because many of the people in prison are being held unnecessarily for drug-related crimes \u2014 that is, jailed for consuming or trafficking substances that shouldn\u2019t be illegal in the first place.

A third agent, Oscar Juarez, reportedly resigned from the agency last month shortly before he was to be fired.\nJaquez and Vasquez have signed their termination papers and are officially dismissed as of Feb. 28.\nInvestigation disclosed that the following BP agents were at the location of the shooting incident, assisted in destroying evidence of the shooting, and/or knew/heard about the shooting: Oscar Juarez; Arturo Vasquez; Jose Mendoza; David Jacquez; Lance Medrano; Lorenzo Yrigoyen; Rene Mendez; Robert Arnold; and Jonathan Richards.\nOf the nine listed agents, two were supervisors, Arnold and Richards. Arnold was a supervisory Border Patrol agent and Richards was a field operations supervisor, the senior BP officer on the field that day. Agents Vasquez, Jacquez and Juarez, were given immunity for their testimony by U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton\u2019s office. All three were called as witnesses by the prosecution to testify against Ramos and Compean at trial.\nAccording to the termination documents, obtained by the Daily Bulletin, Vasquez originally confirmed Compean\u2019s claim he had made a radio call asking for backup after a van driven by suspected drug smuggler Osbaldo Aldrete-Davila twice tripped border sensors.

Their use has grown significantly in recent years, led by brands such as Yakult and Actimel.\nThe products claim to introduce \u201cgood\u201d bacteria to the gut to help with a range of conditions. But scientists at University College London put eight probiotic products through three tests and found only one passed all of them.\nThey investigated whether products contained as many live bacteria as claimed on their labels, whether the bacteria survived in the stomach and whether they then flourished in the gut.\nFour of the eight \u2014 Align, Bio Balance, Bio-Kult and Probio7 \u2014 failed all of the tests. Yakult, a yogurt drink, contained the amount of bacteria claimed, but failed the other two stages, and its rival Actimel fell short on the number of bacteria surviving in the stomach. The only product to pass all three tests was Symprove, a water-based barley drink. Past studies have suggested probiotics could help with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as well as coughs and colds in children and high blood pressure. The probiotic market is estimated to be worth almost \u00a320\u2009billion globally.\nThe study, to be published shortly in the journal Beneficial Microbes, involved multiple batches of each of the products to ensure fair results.\nSymprove, Actimel and Yakult all contained at least as many live bacteria as stated on the packaging but all the others contained less than 75 per cent of what they claimed.\nNext was a test that involved exposing the products to pig stomach fluids for two hours. Only in Symprove and VSL#3 did healthy numbers of bacteria survive the acidic environment, said the authors. In some products, live bacteria disappeared within five minutes and in Yakult they fell significantly after 10 minutes. When used as advised on the label the products take 30 to 120 minutes to pass through the stomach to the small intestine.\nFinally, the scientists looked at whether bacteria could thrive and take hold in the small intestine within 10 hours.\nOnly Symprove, Actimel and VSL#3 passed.

Enter MyRoll, which used to be called Flavyr: A prettier, smarter camera roll that just could find a place on your home screen.\nThe first thing you notice when you open up the MyRoll app, which is available for both iOS(s aapl) and Android(s goog), is that certain photos are larger than others \u2014 it\u2019s not a wall of small thumbnails. There are two primary views: A gallery view, which has an endless river of photos, and moments, which, like the iOS 7 feature, organizes photos into galleries based on time and location the image snaps. But unlike Apple\u2019s implementation, MyRoll draws your eyes to the photos that are most likely to matter to you.\nThe way MyRoll does this is by predicting which photos are most likely to be interesting. For instance, its algorithm looks for smiling subjects, which a good sign that the photo is probably worth highlighting. If the user swipes or shares a photo, that also makes MyRoll more likely to enlarge that specific shot \u2014 so say, if you\u2019re constantly showing friends the same picture of your kid, that photo is more likely to be highlighted. On the other hand, photos that are blurry are less likely to get marquee treatment.\nMyRoll\u2019s sharing features are also very nice: in addition to being able to share galleries through email or text messages, MyRoll also allows to upload an entire moment to a Facebook(s fb) gallery easily, which is very handy. There\u2019s also an option to create a gallery on a webpage, with a URL that\u2019s easy to share.\nUnfortunately there is no cloud component at the moment, which is a missed opportunity. Other companies \u2014 including giants like Dropbox and Google \u2014 are exploring similar gallery ideas, but pairing them with cloud storage, sometimes even in unlimited amounts. There\u2019s also no camera feature, which means you\u2019ll be taking photos with your favorite camera app and then viewing them in MyRoll.\nAlthough the iOS photos app now sorts your photos into \u201cmoments,\u201d there\u2019s still a lot to be desired in the implementation. MyRoll is a simple solution. Instead of replacing multiple aspects of smartphone photography \u2014 the camera, storage, processing \u2014 it focuses on one thing: organizing the photos on your device and making them easy to show off.

Naturally, Russia \"highly likely\" has a hand in it.\nThe alarmist report is published by The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) \u2013 a pro-EU non-profit think tank. The ECFR was established in 2007 and relies primarily on \"donations\" from various organizations \u2013 including such purveyors of a globalist agenda as George Soros' Open Society Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\nNeedless to say, the report paints a very dim picture of a European future if Euroskeptics manage to secure the expected 28 \u2013or even 30\u2013 percent of seats in the EU Parliament in the May elections, as opinion polls indicate. According to the report, Euroskeptic parties from all across Europe \u2013 both left- and right-wing \u2013 are bent on \"paralyzing\" the bloc.\n\"Their ability to paralyze decision-making at the centre of the EU would defuse pro-Europeans' argument that the project is imperfect but capable of reform. At this point, the EU would be living on borrowed time,\" the report warns.\nThe upcoming elections are described in terms like \"battle of ideas,\" \"fight\" and so on. It's pointed out, however, that the EP is \"only one of the European Union's governing bodies and, in many ways, the least powerful of them.\"\nAt the same time, the think tank urges readers not to underestimate the importance of the elections, which could \"have a very high cost for liberal internationalists,\" stressing that a high turnout is key for pushing the Euroskeptics back. It also provides a list of tips on what to tell people to encourage them to go to the polls, warning that a \"defensive\" stance is not sufficient.\nRather than simply fight defensively on the issues that anti-Europeans favour, pro-European forces should be creative in constructing an image of a reinvigorated, hopeful European project.\nApart from general concerns about the alleged desire of assorted Euroskeptics to \"dismantle the rule of law,\" disrupt setting unified environmental regulations and conduct an overall attack on \"European values,\" the \"anti-Europeans\" are, in general, friendly towards Russia, the report warns. Which means that Moscow will, of course, try to meddle with the elections to help them.\nTo back up the warning, the report cites alleged \u2013 but unproven \u2013 Russian meddling in other elections, and uses the tried and trusted \"highly likely\" formula.\n\"Given the Russian interference in recent national elections in Europe, and the tension in EU-Russian relations arising from hostilities in the Sea of Azov in November 2018, it is highly likely that Moscow will attempt to manipulate the EP vote,\" the report claims.\nAt the same time, the think tank acknowledges that the Euroskeptics are very far from being a united force and often have polarized views on various issues. They still, however, might get some common cause \u2013 with their supposed \"love for Russia\" being the main one, naturally.\n\"Love of Russia, hatred of sanctions, and strong protectionist inclinations can unite the far left and the far right. Nonetheless, it is still more common for them to take different approaches,\" the report states."}

While the bill includes a range of reforms, some Democrats made clear that one of their chief targets is President Donald Trump.\nIn a nod to Trump\u2019s resistance to releasing his tax returns, the bill would require presidents to release at least 10 years\u2019 worth of returns. The bill also would ban executive-branch officials from lobbying their old agency for two years after they leave government and reauthorize and enhance the Office of Government Ethics, which has clashed with Trump.\nRep.

It also would increase federal support for state voter systems, including paper ballots to prevent fraud, and restore voting rights for ex-prisoners.\nThe measure also would restore protections included in the 1965 Voting Rights Act and guard against efforts by state officials to purge voting rolls.\nRep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a veteran of the civil rights movement, called voting \u201cthe most powerful, non-violent instrument of transformation we have in our democracy,\u201d and said efforts to make it easier to vote \u2014 not harder \u2014 were crucial.\nBesides election provisions, the bill would set up a public financing system for House races and require political groups to disclose donors. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter would be required to disclose who paid for online ads, similar to existing rules for television and other media.\nIn a move designed to reduce partisan gerrymandering, the bill calls for states to establish independent redistricting commissions to draw boundaries for future congressional districts.\nOn ethics, members of Congress would be barred from serving on corporate boards and could not use taxpayer dollars to settle employment discrimination cases.\nSarbanes and other supporters said the election security measures are particularly important as the 2020 election nears.\nPredicting \u201chistoric turnout,\u201d Sarbanes said officials must not only encourage increased participation, but guard against attempts at sabotage from foreign and domestic adversaries.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not ready for that in all the ways (the legislation) seeks to ensure, then we could end up with a train wreck,\u201d he said."}

Five have won approval, as many as four more could be confirmed this week, and several others should be ready to start their jobs by the middle of the month.\nPuzder, however, has languished. The fast-food executive, who runs the parent company of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardees, has submitted none of the paperwork required by the Senate committee overseeing his confirmation. As a result, the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, has delayed Puzder\u2019s confirmation hearing four times, and now his testimony has been put off indefinitely. An aide to Alexander said the chairman would not schedule Puzder\u2019s hearing until the committee received both a signed agreement from the Office of Government Ethics and responses to a standard questionnaire that is also missing from his file.\nThe delays, along with near-silence from his team, have fed all sorts of rumors and speculation about Puzder, who was already facing stiff Democratic opposition because of his past statements about the minimum wage (he\u2019s against it), a history of labor-law violations at his companies, allegations of domestic abuse by his ex-wife in the 1980s, and risqu\u00e9 ads that Carl\u2019s Jr. has run\u2014and which Puzder has staunchly defended\u2014over the years. Is he having second thoughts? Is he resisting demands from government ethics lawyers to completely divest from his business, CKE Restaurants, after resigning as CEO?\nIn response, Puzder has now twice taken the awkward step of issuing public statements confirming that, yes, he still wants the job. \u201cI am fully committed to becoming secretary of labor and I am looking forward to my hearing,\u201d he said in the most recent of his reaffirmations, sent this week through a spokeswoman after Alexander postponed his hearing for the fourth time.\nTo veterans of the appointments process, Puzder\u2019s experience is a case study in why new administrations should vet potential nominees for financial conflicts of interests before naming them to their posts\u2014something the Trump transition did not do in assembling the Cabinet.

Seventeen of those counts are punishable by death.\nThe verdict -- reached after a day and a half of deliberations -- was practically a foregone conclusion, given his lawyer's startling admission during opening statements that Tsarnaev carried out the attack with his now-dead older brother, Tamerlan.\nThe two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line on April 15, 2013, killed three spectators and wounded more than 260 other people, turning the traditionally celebratory home stretch of the world-famous race into a scene of carnage and putting the city on edge for days.\nTsarnaev was found responsible not only for those deaths but for that of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was shot days later.\nIn the trial's next phase, which could begin as early as Monday, the jury will hear evidence on whether Tsarnaev should get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.\nIn a bid to save him from a death sentence, defense attorney Judy Clarke has argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized brother.\n\"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.\nProsecutors, however, portrayed the brothers -- ethnic Chechens who moved to the U.S. from Russia more than a decade ago -- as full partners in a plan to punish the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Jihadist writings, lectures and videos were found on both their computers, though the defense argued that Tamerlan downloaded the material and sent it to his brother.\nTamerlan, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\nThe government called 92 witnesses over 15 days, painting a hellish scene of torn-off limbs, blood-spattered pavement, ghastly screams and the smell of sulfur and burned hair.\nSurvivors gave heartbreaking testimony about losing legs in the blasts or watching people die.

That\u2019s about six times per hour or once every 10 minutes.\nThe world\u2019s fascination with mobile devices was once again dissected at the two-day \u201cMobile Manila Summit 2015\u201d recently.\nWhile the conference targeted marketers and digital strategists who need to push brands and advocacies into the mobile realm, there are some key takeaways for consumers who want a peak into what mobile life\u2019s really like now.\n\u201cWith a smartphone, people don\u2019t go online anymore, we live online,\u201d Ken Lingan, Google Philippines country manager, quipped in his presentation.\n1. Smartphone is the primary device or gateway to the Internet.\nPeople who first experienced accessing the Internet via desktops and laptops are getting smaller. Lingan says that based on the Google Consumer Barometer Study for first half of 2015, of the 50 million Filipinos online, 61 percent reported that smartphones are their primary device to access the Internet.\n\u201cImagine using the Internet through the small screen anytime, anywhere,\u201d he says. That\u2019s what the mobile life is like.\nThe Google Philippines chief says that the key drivers to the mobile first revolution include a growing middle class.\nBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPOs) firms now employ about a million workers generating US$18 billion in revenues per year, which makes it a massive driver for domestic consumption and enables more people to afford data connectivity.\nTelecommunication companies are also promoting sachet marketing in a big way. For as low P5, one can have 15 minutes of video, making it easier for people to access the Internet through mobile.\nLastly, he says, since 2009, the price of mobile devices has gone down by as much as 30 percent.\n2. Mobile is about data and connectivity.\nThe Philippines is not unique in its mobile preference. The mobile landscape in the Asia-Pacific region shares this characteristic.\nYee Mei Chan, Millard Brown regional director of business transformation, says that worldwide, the Internet is accessed by 65 percent of users on desktop and only 35 percent on mobile.\nHowever, in Asia-Pacific, 50 percent of the population access the Internet through mobile devices.\n\u201cMobile growth is not just about voice and text but more excitingly, about data and connectivity,\u201d she says.\nIndeed, what good is having a cellphone that is offline?\nWhen we say mobile, we hardly think calling and texting anymore.\nWe think Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, chat apps and the whole ecosystem of sharing our personal lives online.\n3.

{"idx": "2891", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Experts say crowding more transistors onto chips requires too much power and causes overheating.\nFor decades, the power of computers has grown at a staggering rate as designers have managed to squeeze ever more and ever tinier transistors onto a silicon chip \u2014 doubling the number every two years, on average, and leading the way to increasingly powerful and inexpensive personal computers, laptops and smartphones.\nNow, however, researchers fear that this extraordinary acceleration is about to meet its limits. The problem is not that they cannot squeeze more transistors onto the chips \u2014 they surely can \u2014 but instead, like a city that cannot provide electricity for its entire streetlight system, that all those transistors could require too much power to run economically. They could overheat, too.\nThe upshot could be that the gadget-crazy populace, accustomed to a retail drumbeat of breathtaking new products, may have to accept next-generation electronics that are only modestly better than their predecessors, rather than exponentially faster, cheaper and more wondrous.\nSimply put, the Next Big Thing may take longer to arrive.\nA paper presented in June at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture summed up the problem: even today, the most advanced microprocessor chips have so many transistors that it is impractical to supply power to all of them at the same time. So some of the transistors are left unpowered \u2014 or dark, in industry parlance \u2014 while the others are working. The phenomenon is known as dark silicon.\nAs early as next year, these advanced chips will need 21 percent of their transistors to go dark at any one time, according to the researchers who wrote the paper. And in just three more chip generations \u2014 a little more than a half-decade \u2014 the constraints will become even more severe. While there will be vastly more transistors on each chip, as many as half of them will have to be turned off to avoid overheating.\nThe problem has the potential to counteract an important principle in computing that has held true for decades: Moore\u2019s Law. It was Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel, who first predicted that the number of transistors that could be nestled comfortably and inexpensively on an integrated circuit chip would double roughly every two years, bringing exponential improvements in consumer electronics.\nIf that rate of improvement lags, much of the innovation that people have come to take for granted will not happen, or will happen at a much slower pace. There will not be new PCs, new smartphones, new LCD TVs, new MP3 players or whatever might become the new gadget that creates an overnight multibillion-dollar industry and tens of thousands of jobs.\nIn their paper, Dr. Burger and fellow researchers simulated the electricity used by more than 150 popular microprocessors and estimated that by 2024 computing speed would increase only 7.9 times, on average. By contrast, if there were no limits on the capabilities of the transistors, the maximum potential speedup would be nearly 47 times, the researchers said.\nSome scientists disagree, if only because new ideas and designs have repeatedly come along to preserve the computer industry\u2019s rapid pace of improvement. Dr. Dally of Nvidia, for instance, is sanguine about the future of chip design.\n\u201cThe good news is that the old designs are really inefficient, leaving lots of room for innovation,\u201d he said.\nBut other experts, not connected with Dr. Burger\u2019s research, acknowledged that he and the paper\u2019s other authors \u2014 from the University of Texas, the University of Washington"}

{"idx": "2895", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Senior living: Is concierge care for you?\nSeven years ago my client told me how pleased she was with the concierge medical practice she and her spouse had joined. She had called her doctor a few days before with a medical need. The nurse answered immediately, and because it was an urgent issue, she was seen that day. The doctor spent 30 minutes with her and called the next day with test results that indicated a need for a specialist referral. The doctor\u2019s staff made the appointment and sent the specialist her records. Just yesterday she told me, \u201cI love our concierge medicine setup.\u201d She said there is an on-call doctor available 24/7, and because for many years my client cared for her severely ill husband, she used this service extensively.\nConcierge medicine was developed in 1996 by a Seattle doctor who decided to charge his patients a retainer fee in exchange for more attentive care. He no longer needed to rely solely on fees from insurance companies and could see fewer patients for longer visits. In concierge medicine there are three basic business models.\nIn Fee for Care (FFC) the patient pays a monthly, quarterly, or annual retainer fee to the physician that covers most physician services. Usually, vaccinations, lab work, x-rays, and other services are excluded and charged on a cash basis. The Fee for Extra Care model is similar to FCC model, however, the additional services are charged to the patient's insurance plan including Medicare. In a hybrid concierge model physicians charge a retainer or membership fee for services like the other models. For covered services, they bill insurance. Physicians still see their non-retainer patients while billing their \"concierge\" patients a fee for the increased services. Some practices are cash-only and don\u2019t accept insurance. They keep overhead and administrative costs low, thereby providing affordable healthcare.\nRetainer models offer same-day access to the doctor through phone calls, online portals, email or text messages. There is little or no waiting time in the office and refreshments are available. The emphasis is on preventive care taking place in unhurried 30 minute visits. One or one and half hour visits for initial and yearly physicals are the norm. Online and telephone consultations are provided as well. Comprehensive annual physicals result in evaluations and wellness plans. Some offer the services of health coaches, newsletters and educational programs.\nConcierge physicians have fewer patients than conventional practice physicians. A concierge doctor told me that in her previous practice she saw several thousand patients a year, but now patients are limited to 600. The traditional physician sees an average of 2,300 patients a year in 10 to 15 minute visits. Other physicians in her practice cover for each other and have access to patient records.\nShe is still quite busy, but in a different way than traditional practice. Now she has time to think, research, plan, evaluate and facilitate her patients\u2019 care and manage all aspects of that care. She has more time with patients to discuss issues and consider how they are related to their overall health. She becomes familiar with her patients\u2019 entire medical history, helping her to see important connections and make more accurate diagnoses. She recommends specialists as needed and coordinates care.\nAnnual member fees range from $1,900 to $5,000 with discounts for additional family members. Other benefits of concierge healthcare may include medically necessary in-home visits and courtesy visits for members out of town guests who get sick while visiting. Concierge physicians are most often family medicine practitioners or internists.\nIt seems to"}

It gets off to a fast start.\nSnapchat is officially a public company.\nSnapchat, the disappearing-photo app that's an all-consuming obsession for young people, is coming of age.\nIn one of the most anticipated tech IPOs in years, its parent company, Snap, went public Thursday morning, with a preopen share price set at $17.\nThat price didn't last long. Snap shares started trading just before 11:30 a.m. ET with an opening price of $24, a jump of 41 percent and a strong signal that investors are buying into the young company's promise. During the course of the day, the stock price came within a few cents of $26 before settling to close at $24.48, a first-day gain of 44 percent.\nThe co-founders, CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares are trading under the ticker symbol SNAP.\nSnap is hoping to raise more than $3 billion with its IPO, money it's going to use to do things like hire more employees or make acquisitions.\nIf you haven't been keeping up, Snap has been one of tech's unlikeliest success stories in years. Started by Spiegel, a 26-year-old Stanford University dropout, the app was once dismissed as a sexting app before finding massive adoption among teens and young adults.\nNow the Los Angeles-based social network is emerging as one of the biggest threats to Facebook and Twitter. Its claim to fame: popularizing casual social networking. Since posts quickly disappear, people don't have to worry about their photos and videos being around or impressive enough to stand the test of time. What Snap has shown is that people can feel comfortable posting anything, from the mundane to amusing.\nAnd young people love it. Nearly 70 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds in the US use the app, according to ComScore. More than 150 million people use the service every day.\nThat's why Snap has drawn the ire and envy of Silicon Valley's biggest companies. Most notably, Facebook is trying to duplicate its product mojo, with a near-identical clone of Snapchat Stories, which lets people post strings of videos and photos that self-detonate after 24 hours.\nStill, the company has its challenges. In its IPO filing released last month, Snap warned of slowing user growth. That explains why Spiegel is hoping to convince investors it's not merely a social media company, but instead a \"camera company.\"\nSnap has already released Spectacles, $130 sunglasses equipped with a camera to make it easy for people to post photos and videos to Snapchat. The company also reportedly has worked on a drone for photographing people from overhead.\n\"In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones,\" the company wrote in its IPO filing. \"This means that we are willing to take risks in an attempt to create innovative and different camera products that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences.\"\nBut even though Snap had a good first day on the market, that doesn't mean it's in the clear.

Oh, and its CEO was part of the deal.\nThat CEO of course was Steve Jobs, as CNET reported.\n\"Jobs...will leave his post as Next's chief executive to become an 'adviser,' reporting directly to Apple chairman and CEO Gilbert Amelio,\" CNET said.\nDaniel Kunstler, at that time an analyst with J.P. Morgan, may have had the most prescient understatement of the decade (at least). \"I really don't see any downside to Steve Jobs returning to Apple,\" he said.\nThe $429 million deal centered on Apple's quest for a new operating system. The company had \"been shopping for an operating system since abandoning its own Copland system...and had been negotiating with Be and other companies to fill that void,\" CNET said.\nBe was not to be, though. Apple opted for Next's object-oriented, Java-enabled NextStep. And, lest we forget, Mac OS X is built on top of this.\nPrior the acquisition, NeXT struggled mightily, though.\nBefore it was a software-only company, NeXT made hardware too. It built upscale workstations--which debuted at more than $6,000--at a cutting-edge factory in Fremont, Calif.\nSo, in the early 1990s, Next turned to its Japanese partner Canon for cash. On top of an original $100 million investment in 1989, Canon provided another $10 million to $20 million in 1991 and extended a $55 million credit line in 1992, as CNET reported.\nThen, in February 1993, Next said it would stop making the Nextcube and Nextstation and focus on object-oriented software for mainstream platforms.\nThat move worked. The company posted a profit in 1994 and licensed its WebObjects to more than 275 customers, including Chrysler, Nike, and Walt Disney.\nAnd take a gander at this video of a master salesman explaining NeXT to the rank and file."}

Dragons can be fierce protectors, too. The magic of the content marketing dragon is lead generation, lead nurturing, and SEO (especially if your dragon has a long tail.) But if you\u2019re going to own a dragon, you have to feed it. Otherwise, no more fire. No more magic.\nThis is the chief content officer. This person keeps the dragon in line. The keeper needs to be strong, insistent on regular feedings of great content, watchful of mischief and laziness.\nEstablish a consistent process. Create an editorial calendar to keep you ahead of the game, instead of rushing to identify and produce content under looming deadlines. Allow enough time for content ideation, and build in sufficient time for review and revisions to make the content great. Hold contributors accountable for both quality and deadlines, the same as you would for any of their responsibilities.\nNo single mortal can feed the content marketing dragon by himself. (There are some gods, but these are few.) Everyone needs to contribute; everyone needs to learn to cook. The dragon is always hungry.\nShare the responsibilities. Identify a group of potential contributors, and ask them what they\u2019re passionate about, what interests them. Writing will come easy if they\u2019re focused on what they love. Meet regularly as a team. Remember to continually recruit new people to create content. This brings fresh ideas and new energy. It\u2019s also a great compliment and opportunity for staff members.\nAlthough smart, dragons tend to be vain. They like to look at and talk about themselves. They could care less if anyone is listening. Make sure your dragon serves others and shares his wisdom generously\u2014but in a nice way. Nobody likes a cocky dragon.\nYour content marketing efforts are bound to fail if they\u2019re focused on you. If you\u2019re struggling to identify meaningful, valuable content, you\u2019re probably too focused on promotion. What do your customers and prospects need? What would be helpful to them? When you\u2019re focused on what they need, identifying and creating content becomes easy.\nDragons tend to hoard things. Greedy and jealous, they like to keep their jewels in their lair. When developing content, keep your focus on giving, not on what you hope to get. Too many organizations say, \u201cWe can\u2019t share that. We can\u2019t give that away.\u201d That mindset limits possibilities and opportunities. I\u2019m convinced that whatever you \u201cgive away\u201d you\u2019ll receive five-fold in return.\nContent marketing assets are great for organic search. Allow sufficient time prior to release to align content with a keyword strategy for the piece. Make sure you optimize not only for head terms, but also for the long tail. That\u2019s where these assets can really shine. If the full asset is only available with registration, be sure to create a publicly available optimized summary or abstract that can be indexed by the search engines.\nTake care of the content marketing dragon, and it will advance and protect your brand.

That\u2019s more people than voted for Labour.\nThe Times was broadly pro-Conservative in its leader comments, but more even-handed in its news coverage and general comment. The Daily Express leaned to the right, but supported UKIP, which took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives.\nThe Daily Star did not declare a political affiliation. The Guardian and Independent are on the left, but again were more balanced in their coverage, with the latter providing a late surprise endorsement of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.\nThe Daily Mirror is strongly pro-Labour in both its political stories and editorials.\nSo any analysis of the extent to which the press influenced the general election needs to be confined, in my view, to the most highly partisan titles: the Daily Mail, Sun, Daily Telegraph and Daily Mirror (I've only got data for the daily titles).\nThere's more detail here from the Media Standards Trust and here from Loughborough University providing evidence of general election press bias.\nThe great unknown is the extent to which papers reflect the views of their readers, and the extent to which they influence them.\nBut let\u2019s make a big assumption and say that Telegraph, Sun and Mail readers buy those papers for reasons other than their politics and would vote in line with the rest of the population if they weren't influenced by what they read.\nDaily Telegraph: 64 per cent.\nTaking the somewhat generous NRS readership estimates as our guide \u2013 this suggests that between them they might have delivered around 850,000 votes to the Tories.\nTaking The Sun as an example, Yougov thinks its readers backed the paper at a rate 5 percentage points higher than the general population \u2013 with 2.2m readers that's 265,000.

{"idx": "2913", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Warner Bros.' upcoming Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes place in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, some seventy years or so before the battle between You-Know-Who and The Boy Who Lived. However, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling - making her screenwriting debut on Fantastic Beasts - has cautioned that this new wizard adventure will not attempt to serve as a prequel to Harry's story; rather, for all intents and purposes, it's a standalone adventure about Mr. Newt Scamander.\nThere's only ever been one candidate listed as the front-runner to play Mr. Scamander in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts movie by director David Yates (the final four Harry Potter films) - namely, actor Eddie Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar winning turn in The Theory of Everything as well as his... memorable performance in the Wachowskis' Jupiter Ascending. Well, it's now official: Redmayne will be headlining the upcoming fantasy adventure.\nScamander, as Harry Potter buffs will already know, is a \"preeminent magizoologist, who in his travels has encountered and documented a myriad of magical creatures,\" as he's described in the WB press release confirming Redmayne for the film. The character eventually pens the Hogwarts School textbook \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", but Rowling and Yates' upcoming feature film starts out well before that happens. Plot details beyond that, however, remain under-wraps for the time being.\n\"Eddie Redmayne has emerged as one of today\u2019s most extraordinarily talented and acclaimed actors. We are thrilled to welcome him into J.K. Rowling\u2019s Wizarding World, where we know he will deliver a remarkable performance as Newt Scamander, the central character in \u2018Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.'\"\nRedmayne, whom Yates described as a \"fearless actor, brimming with invention, wit and humanity\" in WB's press release, won't be the only main character in Fantastic Beasts, of course. It's been reported that Rowling's script begins in New York and includes lead roles for four Americans: two women, two men. The casting process for the movie's female leads (said to be a pair of sisters, Queenie and Tina) is already underway, with folk like Saoirse Ronan, Dakota Fanning, and Kate Upton said to be among those in contention. There's no word yet on might play the two American men, though.\nMost of the people working behind the scenes on Fantastic Beasts were also involved with the Harry Potter movies; including, producers David Heyman and Lionel Wigram, as well as writer/producer Steve Kloves. It stands to reason, then, that Fantastic Beasts shouldn't have much trouble upholding the quality standard of the Boy Wizard film saga, while also further exploring not just the Wizarding World - but doing so in an intriguing historical time period (read: 1920s-30s New York), no less. Yates' years of experience making these big-budget fantasies ought to likewise aid in bringing Rowling's new vision to cinematic life.\nInterestingly, Fantastic Beasts will be the first Wizarding World film not based on previously-established source material with a firm storyline (seeing as the 2001 \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find The"}
{"idx": "2914", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: JOHN MAGUFULI, the president of Tanzania, has strong views about birth control. He does not see the point. In 2016 he announced that state schools would be free, and, as a result, women could throw away their contraceptives. On September 9th this year he told a rally that birth control was a sign of parental laziness. Tanzania must not follow Europe, he went on, where one \u201cside effect\u201d of widespread contraception is a shrinking labour force.\nThere seems little danger of that. Tanzania\u2019s fertility rate is estimated to be 4.9, implying that the average woman will have that many children. Europe\u2019s rate is 1.6. Tanzania is helping drive a continental baby boom. In 1950 sub-Saharan Africa had just 180m people\u2014a third of Europe\u2019s population. By 2050 it will have 2.2bn\u2014three times as many as Europe. If UN forecasts are right, sub-Saharan Africa will have 4bn people in 2100 (see chart 1).\nThat is worrying, although not for the old reasons. In \u201cAn Essay on the Principle of Population\u201d, published in 1798, Thomas Malthus claimed that the human population was bound to increase faster than the supply of food, leading to catastrophe. Although Malthus is still admired by some, the green revolution rubbished his hypothesis. The fear now is not that countries will run out of food but that a surfeit of babies will retard their development.\nMr Magufuli is right to suggest that Europe has many old people and could do with more workers to support them. But Tanzania\u2019s many children weigh on its economy, too. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s dependency ratio (the population younger than 20 and older than 64 versus the population between those ages) is 129:100, compared with 65:100 in Europe. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to have a worse dependency ratio than Europe even in 2050.\nHigh fertility can also be seen as a global problem, says Bill Gates, whose foundation (jointly run with his wife, Melinda) will hold a conference next week about the state of the world. Overall, humanity is becoming wealthier. But because birth rates are so high in the poorest parts of the world\u2019s poorest countries, poverty and sickness are that much harder to eradicate. \u201cKids are being born exactly in the places\u201d where it is hardest to get schooling, health and other services to them, he explains.\nThere is nothing inherently African about large families. Botswana\u2019s fertility rate is 2.6, down from 6.6 in 1960. South Africa\u2019s rate is 2.4. And although the UN has a good record of predicting global population growth, it has got fertility projections badly wrong in individual countries. Sudden baby busts in countries like Brazil, Iran and Thailand caught almost everyone out. Could Africa also spring a surprise?\nThe UN\u2019s demographers project that fertility will fall in every single mainland African country over the next few decades. They just expect a much slower pace of change than Asia or Latin America managed when their families were the same size. It took Asia 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, to go from a fertility rate above five to below three. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to complete the"}

She was soon battling the city on pesticide use, the location of roads, the mess in our old landfills, ill-considered plans to make inroads into our watershed areas, and the location of bird-killing power lines.\nMore often than not, Elke\u2019s wise counsel was ignored. But she persisted with determination, stinging wit and endless supply of facts. If you asked her a question about a local or regional environmental issue, as I often did, she would reply with multiple emails full of insights, history and facts.\nShe would observe, sadly, that St. Albert is not a happy place to be a tree. She was a gadfly -- and I mean that as a compliment, a person who persistently cajoled, criticized, demanded and offered positive solutions.\nGenerations of city councillors found it easy to praise her for her energy and her contribution to civic life, even to bestow upon her the occasional honour -- like naming the peninsula at the Riel Stormwater Pond, a favoured gathering place for many species of bird, \"Elke\u2019s Peninsula\" -- all the while not paying that much attention to what she had to say.\nOne of those former councillors, the estimable Neil Korotash, wrote on Facebook Friday night: \"She frustrated the heck out of municipal planners, engineers, and politicians but it was always with the drive and determination to protect and preserve our landscape and local ecosystems. Elke was passionate but rational -- two attributes that don't always align.\"\nDespite the frustrations, she always persisted, although these past few years you could tell she was getting tired of the grind, not showing up at City Council as often, not writing quite as many letters.\nElke\u2019s artwork focused on pottery made with traditional Japanese firing techniques. Her works are in collections around the world, including the Banff Centre, the Canada Council Art Bank in Ottawa, and the Consulate-General of Japan in Edmonton. She was married to the poet Ted Blodgett. Her son Gunnar Blodgett is a web and systems architect in Edmonton, her daughter Astrid Blodgett is an author, and another daughter, Kirsten Gill, is a teacher and farmer east of the city.\nOver the years, I have often seen Elke in the distance, trudging across Ray Gibbon Drive toward Big Lake. It could be winter or summer, rain, snow or sunshine. There she was, a tiny determined dynamo.\nEven in the distance, not much more than a dot on the landscape, there was something forceful about this small person.

The 49ers were in town to play the Indianapolis Colts.\nPence was in town to upstage Peyton Manning.\nWhat, you think he didn\u2019t know the 49ers would kneel on Sunday? Pence knew. The 49ers are the one franchise, the only franchise, that have had at least one player kneel before every game since Colin Kaepernick was the first to do it in the 2016 preseason. Kaepernick played for the 49ers, of course. Last week, following Trump\u2019s unpatriotic assertion that he would fire someone for exercising their First Amendment rights, more than half the San Francisco roster knelt.\nHell, the media members that follow Pence were told before the game not to bother leaving their vans and enter Lucas Oil Stadium, according to a tweet from NBC News Vaughn Hillyard. They wouldn\u2019t be there long, because Pence wouldn\u2019t be there long. Trump, as Trump is wont to do, took credit in a tweet for Pence's walkout by saying he'd asked Pence to leave if anyone knelt.\nListen, part of me \u2013 a small part, and not that part that won this internal argument \u2013 admired Pence for the irony of his blatant look-at-me maneuver.

So, leave.

I couldn't have done it. My successors couldn't have done it.\"\nKay said he had mixed emotions when he saw the centrifuge components: \"It was a realization that I hadn't gotten all the parts [of Iraq's nuclear program]. So there was a moment of regret, but there was also an exhilaration that now maybe we have a chance to take this to the very bottom.\"\nCNN learned of the discovery last week but made a decision to withhold the story at the request of the U.S. government, which cited safety and national security concerns.\nThe U.S. government told CNN the security and safety issues have been dealt with and there is no risk now in telling the story fully.\nThe gas centrifuge equipment dates to Iraq's pre-1991 efforts to build nuclear weapons.\nExperts said the documents and pieces Obeidi gave the United States were the critical information and parts to restart a nuclear weapons program, and would have saved Saddam's regime several years and as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for research.\nDavid Albright, who was a U.N. nuclear weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s, said inspectors \"understood that Iraq probably hid centrifuge documents, may have had components, and so it is very important that those items be found.\"\n"}

President Mills polled 2,771 (96.90%).\nHe said that the defeat signifies that the delegates do not agree that Nana Konadu should contest President Mills, explaining that he felt so sad at what happened on Saturday.\nHe added that the same thing happened to Dr Obed Asamoah at the Koforidua congress of 2006 but in the case of the former President and his wife, the embarrassment was so great that they could not even wait for the victory speech of President Mills.\nMr. Smith claimed he had credible information that Mr. Rawlings held a meeting with key personalities in FONKAR and advised that Nana Konadu should step down but some of the members of the campaign team including his own daughter, Yaa Asantewaa Rawlings disagreed.\n\u201cThese young men who were campaigning for Nana Konadu, we wonder where they came from.

But due to the PTI government\u2019s recent policy, the excise and taxation department refused to register 4,641 vehicles which were purchased even before the promulgation of the law, the petitioner claimed.\nAccording to the petition, the finance division recently amended Section 227-C of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, through the Finance Act 2018, which was totally discriminatory and ultra vires to the Constitution.\nArticle 23 provided every citizen the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property, the petition mentioned, adding that \u201cthe prohibition on non-filers to acquire such property and for the motor vehicles manufacturers to sell the same to non-filers does not constitute reasonable restrictions in the context of Article 23 or otherwise, including Articles 18 and 24\u201d.\n\u201cFurthermore, Section 227-C is also discriminatory in nature,\u201d it said.\nAccording to the petition, it is only in relation to motor vehicles and immovable property above Rs5 million that impediments have been introduced in transaction with or by non-filers. This is a clear violation of Article 25 of the Constitution, as there is no reasonable justification based upon any objective criteria or intelligible differentia so as to introduce such a hindrance only on immovable properties and motor vehicles, the petition claimed.\nDr Awan through the petition argued that as the amendment only targeted one class of business, which was the car industry, it was discriminatory and hence liable to be declared as ultra vires to the Constitution.\n\u201cJust because a person is able to purchase a motor vehicle does not necessarily mean that he shall have taxable income in a particular tax year. A motor vehicle is purchasable through instalments or upon yearly savings or by acquiring a loan or as a gift. The data and details of motor vehicles purchasers are very much available with the FBR/taxation authorities and, therefore, the onus is upon the taxation authorities of the FBR to conduct their own investigation,\u201d he argued.\nThe petition asserted that the finance division, excise and taxation department and FBR had already been charging \u201ca number of indirect taxes on motor vehicles\u201d.\nThe IHC was requested to set aside the amendment to Section 227-C of the Income Tax Ordinance.\nAfter hearing the arguments, Justice Farooq issued notice to the attorney general and adjourned the hearing for a fortnight.\n\"Just because a person is able to purchase a motor vehicle does not necessarily mean that"}

This freedom from scrutiny and being held to account allows politicians to buy support easily*, thus maintaining their power-base and their power.\n*There is no other reason than this to understand why the electoral process in Brasil is a frantic scramble to be a continuous part of every coalition government.\nThe gift of ministries and their ministerial budgets to individual political parties keeps them in line and maintains the gravy-train on the never-ending corrupt track.\nIt's only when somebody like Rousseff, who has not been part of the political class, and"}

But she\u2019s happy to supplement her meal with a snack from school; she bought dessert and chips recently.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really buy school food because it\u2019s disgusting, but the snack food is good,\u201d Hannah said.\nStarting next year, though, new federal nutrition standards aim to make school snacks healthier. But history shows that when the food becomes healthier, kids buy less.\nAnd with some jurisdictions\u2019 school food-service budget relying on the sale of snack foods, that could cause a revenue problem, officials say.\nMarilyn Moody, senior director of child nutrition services for the Wake County, N.C., school system, said $10 million of the department\u2019s $50 million yearly budget comes from snack food sales. These snacks are the foods and drinks found in vending machines or sold as extras \u2014 \u201ca la carte items\u201d in school nutrition-speak \u2014 on the lunch line. The rest of the revenue comes almost entirely from federal reimbursements and students paying for meals.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why a la carte items are important to us, because we want to hold the price of the entire lunch \u2014 the price that the paying customers have to pay \u2014 as low as we possibly can to still break even,\u201d Moody said.\nEast Cary Middle\u2019s cafeteria is like many others. As students walk through the lunch line, they first pick out milk and then serve themselves an entree, fruits and vegetables \u2014 all part of the standard and nutritionally balanced lunch. But between there and the cash registers are the a la carte items \u2014 vegetable packs, chips, pudding, ice cream and cookies. Prices typically range from 50 cents to a dollar for the goodies.\nLast month, the federal Department of Agriculture released the \u201cSmart Snacks in School\u201d interim nutrition standards, which must be met by July 2014. Wake County has already taken voluntary steps to gradually make snack foods healthier, Moody said. But as the food became healthier, students bought less and revenue from snack items dropped from $13 million of a $48 million budget in 2008 to today\u2019s $10 million. The county made up for the loss by raising lunch prices by 25 cents two years ago.\nCurrently, school lunch costs $2 at elementary schools and $2.25 at middle and high schools, Moody said.\nThe new standards will come with an additional 6 cents in federal subsidies per meal which might help balance out the anticipated loss in snack revenues, but at this point officials said they don\u2019t know whether it will be enough.\nThe revenue problems are not limited to Wake County, though. Snack foods generate $325 million in revenue across the state, said Lynn Harvey, section chief of child nutrition services at the state Department of Public Instruction.\n\u201cAny program that begins to erode those sales could potentially be problematic for the state and for local food makers, because they\u2019re going to need alternative revenues (from) somewhere,\u201d she said.\nAdditionally, the new regulations will present a logistical challenge for school districts across the state, Harvey said. Any time regulations change the nutritional requirements of food, vendors have to either change the recipe to comply or school districts have to find new food to serve.

The government of Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill presides over one of the world\u2019s most impoverished countries.\nThe stoppage, dubbed the \u201cMaserati strike,\u201d was organised after the government imported 40 high-end Maseratis, costing up to $350,000 each, and three luxury Bentleys, to ferry dignitaries during the conference in the capital Port Moresby.\nThe 21-member APEC summit, the first to be held in a Pacific island nation, will be attended by US Vice President Mike Pence, China\u2019s president Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, along with 9,000 delegates, staff and media. Amid deepening geo-strategic tensions across the Asia-Pacific and the drive to war, Canberra and Beijing have vied to provide millions of dollars in financial, logistical and infrastructure backing for the event.\nThe Guardian reported that O\u2019Neill\u2019s extravagant vehicle purchase was greeted with widespread \u201canger and disbelief,\u201d particularly in the desperately impoverished provincial areas. Martyn Namorong, a PNG commentator and one of the protest organisers, said the fact the purchase was only revealed in a news report highlighted the lack of \u201ctransparency\u201d around government spending.\nNamorong declared that the strike was not a protest against the summit. \u201cIt\u2019s a protest against the corruption associated with the hosting of APEC. It\u2019s not a protest against world leaders, it\u2019s a protest against our own corrupt, unaccountable politicians,\u201d he said.\nThe Minister for APEC, Justin Tkatchenko, claimed the costs would be recouped by selling the cars to the private sector, predicting they would be snapped up \u201clike hot cakes.\u201d Transparency International (TI) said O\u2019Neill had failed to reveal procurement documents, let alone any likely purchasers. A TI spokesman told Radio New Zealand the cars would likely be on-sold to people \u201cin the know,\u201d at knock-down prices and minus freight charges or import duties.\nOpposition MPs called the national day of protest, urging people to boycott work and stay at home. Strikers reportedly included transport drivers and airport staff. Bryan Kramer, MP for Madang, said the boycott was successful and there was \u201cvery little traffic on the road\u201d during Port Moresby\u2019s peak hour. In the north of the country, bus drivers refused to work in Wewak, and in Lae, PNG\u2019s second largest city, many people simply attended an agriculture show.\nThe strikers defied threats from government officials. Chief Secretary Isaac Lupari declared that public servants who failed to report for work would be \u201cin breach of the Public Service Act and their employment conditions.\u201d Police commissioner Gary Baki warned that police would \u201cnot tolerate\u201d protests or marches.\nIn response to growing social opposition, the government has increasingly turned to repressive measures. Last month parliament passed legislation giving unprecedented powers to foreign forces and security personnel during APEC. A former PNG defence force commander Jerry Singirok told Radio NZ that the legislation violates the country\u2019s constitution. He said that under the law change, basic rights of citizens could be over-ridden by external security forces.\n"}

The attacker's identity and motive were not immediately known, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said, but added the \"first indications\" suggested it was an act of terrorism.\n\"Thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and police officers,\" Michel posted on Twitter. The prime minister broke off his vacation in the south of France and was returning to Belgium for an emergency meeting of the government's National Security Council on Sunday.\nMichel told RTL television in an interview that he has also asked the independent OCAM agency to immediately assess whether there is an increased threat to Belgian internal security. Belgium has been on high alert in the wake of the March 22 suicide bombings claimed by the Islamic State extremist group that killed 32 people in Brussels.\nCharleroi police spokesman David Quinaux said Saturday's attacker carried the weapon in a sports bag, and pulled it out as he arrived at a security checkpoint outside police headquarters in the southern Belgian city just before 4 p.m.\nOne of the two police, both of whom were described as experienced law enforcement officers, received several deep slashing cuts to the face, Quinaux said. The other was slightly wounded.\nBoth officers are now \"out of danger,\" Charleroi police announced Saturday evening on Twitter.\nA third officer at the scene shot the attacker, who died of his wounds at a hospital, officials said.\nBelgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said it wasn't immediately clear whether the assault, which he denounced as an \"act of barbarism\" was the deed of a single person or something more elaborate.\n\"We don't know if this is the action of a lone wolf,\" Jambon told RTL. He said he had no information he could provide immediately on the identity or motivation of the attacker.\nBelgium has been at Level 3 on a four-point terrorism alert scale since the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 that killed 130 victims. Many of the Paris attackers, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, lived in Belgium.\nLast weekend, a 33-year-old man identified only as Nourredine H. was arrested on charges of participating in a terrorist group and planning \"terrorist murders\" following searches in the city of Liege and the Mons region.\nThe attack Saturday took place near a wooden building that had been erected outside the Charleroi police station to provide an additional layer of security.\nPaul Magnette, the city's mayor, said the checkpoint succeeded in preventing the machete-wielding man from reaching the building and causing more havoc. Magnette said that in the wake of the incident, Belgian authorities have begun discussing whether security for police facilities and officers should be reinforced further.\nSteps were taken to better protect Belgian police installations after an IS-linked extremist plot was foiled in January 2014 in the eastern city of Verviers.\nThe Verviers plotters, two of whom were shot dead, had parts of police uniforms in their possession, and were believed to have been planning to attack a police station.

While the $5,000 for Invisalign clear aligners in South Florida where she is a freelance writer is $1,000 less than a friend is paying in New York, she is kicking herself because she missed out on a Groupon that would have saved her even more.\nParents often blanch at the price tag of braces for their children but count it as a known cost of raising offspring. When it comes to their own teeth, however, adults are a lot more cautious about the money involved. Using braces to fix dental problems such as crooked teeth or bite problems can cost between $3,000 and $7,000, depending on the treatment options and where you live.\nThe number of American adults over 18 sporting some form of a \u201cbrace face\u201d is roughly 1.2 million, or 20 percent of the 5.9 million patients orthodontia patients nationwide, according to the American Association of Orthodontists. That is up from 875,000 adult patients in 1989.\n\u201cAdults are very careful. They are making the investment, and they want to make sure they are getting their money\u2019s worth,\u201d says Dr. Morris Poole, president of the AAO and a practicing orthodontist in Logan, Utah.\nMost orthodontists charge a flat fee based on the duration and complexity of the case. Retainers and some follow-up care are usually included, says Poole.\nAs costs vary greatly, it pays to shop around. \u201cMost will do a no-charge consultation,\u201d says Dr. David Bonebreak, who participates in two orthodontic practices near Howard County, Maryland. If you like an expensive doctor more than others with cheaper plans, he suggests asking for price matching.\nKatrina Morrison, a 38-year-old mom of three from Atlanta who works as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines, went to three different orthodontists for consultations and ended up going with the mid-priced one.\nThe more expensive option required a massive down payment of $1,000. The cheaper option was a discount chain that charged $99 a month, but did not offer a dedicated doctor with each visit.\n\u201cI really wanted that personalized service,\u201d Morrison says.\nOne way that Morrison saved money was by working all the breaks - the most significant being a family discount since she used the same orthodontist as her children. She also was able to pay upfront some of the $4,500 total cost and work out a payment plan over 20 months for the rest.\nMorrison\u2019s dental insurance covered 50 percent of her costs, but Faust\u2019s insurance would not cover any of her Invisalign because it was considered cosmetic. If she had gone for traditional braces, it would have covered $2,000, but that would have been a lifetime benefit. Slightly less than half of the patients Poole sees have any sort of dental coverage at all, he says.\nRachel Teodoro, a 36-year-old mom and blogger from Seattle, Washington, was able to get some discounts by paying the $6,500 charge upfront and in cash, which she was able to do because her family had socked away money in their Health Savings Account.\n\u201cIt makes sense to fund it, because it\u2019s not tax"}

But any significant shift could disappoint his core supporters.\nAP - Donald Trump says he'll deliver a detailed speech Wednesday on his proposal to crack down on illegal immigration \u2014 but it's anyone's guess what he will say.\nThe announcement came late Sunday in a tweet by the Republican presidential nominee after days of wavering \u2014 and at least one canceled speech \u2014 on a question central to his campaign: Whether he would, as he said in November, use a \"deportation force\" to eject the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally.\nTrailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in many key states 10 weeks before the election, Trump is trying to win over moderate Republicans, some of whom have been turned off by his rhetoric on immigration and other issues. But any significant shift could disappoint his core supporters.\nTrump's immigration speech in Arizona will come after he and Clinton spent last week trading accusations on racial issues. Trump called Clinton \"a bigot;\" Clinton accused Trump of allowing hate groups to take over the Republican Party.\nClinton is starting this week by announcing her proposals for dealing with mental health issues. She is stressing the need to fully integrate mental health services into the U.S. health care system. Her plan stresses early diagnosis and intervention and calls for a national initiative for suicide prevention.\nImmigration issues dominated the Sunday talk shows as Trump's surrogates, led by running mate Mike Pence, discussed his approach. But none could address whether Trump still favored a deportation force.\nThey said Trump's immigration policy will be humane, and insisted he has not been wavering on the issue. Any discussion of inconsistencies, they suggested, reflected media focus on the wrong issue.\nTrump's tweet Sunday suggested he was poised to clear up questions about his immigration stance.\nTrump's campaign also announced on Sunday a $10 million-plus buy for ads to air in nine competitive states starting Monday. And late Sunday, America's only African-American owned and operated national Christian television network announced that its president and CEO, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, would interview the Republican nominee Saturday in Detroit.\nIt's been a long and sometimes puzzling journey to this point for Trump, who defeated 16 Republican opponents while promising to be the toughest on illegal immigration. Trump even questioned whether those born in the United States to people here illegally are citizens \u2014 even though they have automatically been considered citizens since the adoption of the constitution's 14th Amendment in 1868.\nBut lately, Trump has been exploring the issue's complexities. Trump had suggested he might be \"softening\" on the deportation force and that he might be open to allowing at least some immigrants in the country illegally to stay, as long as they pay taxes.\nBut by Thursday, he was ruling out any kind of legal status \u2014 \"unless they leave the country and come back,\" he told CNN.\nTrump has focused lately on deporting people who are in the U.S. illegally and who have committed crimes. But whom Trump considers a criminal remains unclear.\nThe speech has been rescheduled at least once. Trump's campaign had scheduled it for last Thursday, then canceled it. The campaign also blamed staff error for reports that it had been scheduled for August 31 in Phoenix.\nBut it's not clear what he'll say, apparently even to his top supporters.\nAsked whether the \"deportation force\" proposal Trump laid out in November is still in place, Pence"}

But it is generally absent from your public comments and policy proposals. Your recent 10-point plan omits any mention of foreign policy whatsoever.\nWe believe this omission is not just a shortcoming. We believe it renders what does get included incoherent. Military spending is well over 60% of discretionary spending. A public policy that avoids mentioning its existence is not a public policy at all. Should military spending go up or down or remain unchanged? This is the very first question. We are dealing here with an amount of money at least comparable to what could be obtained by taxing the wealthy and corporations (something we are certainly in favor of as well).\nA tiny fraction of U.S. military spending could end starvation, the lack of clean water, and various diseases worldwide.

It continues, \"Therefore, it is important to carefully inspect the hubcap, axle shaft end and retaining nut for system identification.\" There should be a label or identification plate stating: \"Warning: Removal Voids Warranty,\" \"Caution: Removal of Long Life Bearings will Void Axle Warranty\" or \"Warning: Do Not Service Hub and Bearing System.\" If there is no label, you have an older design.\nIf you are buying a new truck or selecting between several used ones, try to specify unitized, factory assembled wheel ends. They will save you a great deal of work, and could help prevent accidents.\nMost existing wheel end assemblies are not unitized. They still require periodic servicing and it is absolutely critical that adjustments must be within a specific range. The assemblies contain a seal to hold lubrication in the parts that rotate with the wheel. They consist of two single row, widespread, tapered roller bearing assemblies and an adjusting mechanism, which is a single nut held in place with a cotter pin, a tang-type locking adjustment nut or a spindle washer-type adjustment nut. Each has a method for preventing the nut from backing-off once adjustment is made.\nWhen wheel ends are out of adjustment or seals are not correctly seated, dire consequences result. Leaky wheel seals can allow bearings to run dry. Without proper lubrication bearings can freeze on the axle, score or burn through it. The result will be the wheel assembly separating from the truck. The separation has the potential to cause damage to other vehicles, severe injury or, in far too many cases, death.\nAdjustment nuts that are too tight can squeeze the bearings and prevent their rotation. This too, can score or burn axles, with the same unfortunate result. If the nuts are too loose, wheel wobble could cause irregular tire wear, cocking of the bearings, spindle damage and wheel separation. When bearings or seals are not properly installed, it is almost impossible to get accurate adjustment at the nut. Even if torque readings are correct, dimensions will be off. We're not talking about huge amounts. Tolerance for end-play at the edge of the brake drum is often only .001 inch to .004 inch.\nProblems start when seals and bearings are removed. Seals are manufactured to extremely close tolerances, and care must be taken to install them properly. Installation, according to TMC RP622 (\"Wheel Seal and Bearing Removal, Installation and Maintenance\"), starts with handling and storage.\nUse a crow's foot pry bar to gently remove the old seal from the hub bore. If there is a wear sleeve on the spindle, remove it by striking the face with the round end of a ball peen hammer. Never use a chisel or sharp tool that could damage the spindle. Discard the seal. Never re-use a seal.\nRemove the bearing cup, following the hub manufacturers' procedures. Use a bearing puller if available, or a soft steel pry bar. Do not use hardened tools. If the hub is aluminum, extreme care must be"}

This is a problem for him in many ways, I\u2019m sure. But the only one I truly sympathize with him on is that his hands are too large for the Nintendo Switch in portable mode. Mine are also too big. I strained some muscles and ligaments playing that system for extended periods of time when Dead Cells came out. But he finds the Switch so uncomfortable that he has already sold his. I get that, but I think he should give it another try because of a new accessory called the Pro Gaming Grip from Satisfye.\nThe Pro Gaming Grip is a plastic outer shell that you wrap around Nintendo\u2019s hybrid handheld/home console. It adds some extra bulk as well as extended hand grips on each edge of the device. This makes the Switch feel significantly more ergonomic.\nWhen you hold the Switch with the Pro Gaming Grip, it actually feels a lot more like a Wii U Gamepad. The hand grips probably still aren\u2019t as long as I would like, but Satisfye has made the system feel a lot closer to a large version of something you\u2019d use with other home consoles.\nThe big problem with the Pro Gaming Grip is probably the one you\u2019re already imagining. The system is a lot less portable when it\u2019s in that shell. If it ever fit into your pocket, which it probably didn\u2019t, it certainly won\u2019t anymore. You can get a Satisfye carrying case to help with that, but that is also extremely large compared to other cases.\nBut sacrificing portability for comfort is something I\u2019m OK with.

Witnesses are expected to tell a judge how Savio discussed and wrote about her fears that Peterson, a former Bolingbrook police sergeant, would kill her.\nThe hearing, projected to last three weeks, is expected to provide the first detailed look at evidence prosecutors contend ties Peterson to Savio's 2004 death. It stems from a state law that allows a judge to admit hearsay evidence in first-degree murder cases if prosecutors can prove a defendant killed a witness to prevent him or her from testifying.\nIssam Karam, who said he worked with Savio at Parkway Imaging in Romeoville in late 2003, testified that Savio told him she had come home one night looking forward to a bath and glass of wine when Peterson threw her to the floor. Savio said the incident occurred after she had changed the locks to the home.\nKaram said Peterson grabbed Savio's throat and had a knife. Savio showed him a bruise on her arm, Karam said.\n\"(Peterson) said nothing that she could do would make her safe,\" Karam said. \"She could not run or hide. He could kill her there and then.\"\nAnother witness, Savio's boss, testified that a number of times a Bolingbrook squad car was parked in front of her Romeoville business while Savio was inside. Lisa Mordente said that on one occasion, Savio was returning from lunch and approached another vehicle parked outside and spoke to a man inside.\n\"She was very shaken up when she came back in, her hand was shaking, she had tears, she was a mess,\" Mordente said.\nMordente also testified that Savio told her it was Peterson outside and they were fighting over money.\nMordente's testimony highlighted what is sure to be a key part of the trial \u0097 the fact that Peterson was a police officer. His attorneys have raised questions about why witnesses didn't notify police if they believed Savio feared Peterson.\nMordente said she didn't call police when she learned Savio died \"because it wouldn't have helped.\"\n\"Kathleen had stated on several occasions she had called police,\" Mordente said.\nDuring the hearing, prosecutors will present to Will County Judge Stephen White about 60 witnesses to testify about 15 hearsay statements. White will then decide if the jury can hear any or all of those statements when Peterson stands trial. Peterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering Savio, whose body was found in a dry tub. A trial date hasn't been set.\nThe Illinois Legislature passed the hearsay law after authorities named Peterson a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy, then exhumed the body of Savio and reopened the investigation into her death.\nWhile neither side has talked much about the evidence in the case, from the day Peterson was arrested, Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow has made it clear that allowing Savio to tell jurors why Peterson wanted her dead is crucial to his case.\n\"In essence, what you'"}

People may drive faster, he said, and pedestrians may be less attentive.\nAdvocates of perpetual DST have some statistics on their side. Adding an hour of sunlight in the evening year-round would save the lives of more than 170 pedestrians annually, according to a 2004 study in Accident Analysis and Prevention. The lives of nearly 200 vehicle occupants would also theoretically be saved by the change.\nBut despite this data, some child advocacy groups such as the National PTA have argued for more sunlight in the morning hours when children will be traveling to school. In 2005, the group opposed bringing DST forward into March from April. \"People who take their kids to school in the morning, they kind of like Daylight Saving Time,\" said Gerard. \"They can deal with [darkness] at the end of the day, but in the morning it\u2019s tough getting going.\"\nBoth advocates and opponents of DST can agree, however, that better light equals greater safety \u2014 which is why some child safety advocates say that communities need to focus on providing better artificial street lighting, regardless of whether it's used in the morning or evening. \"The more visible kids are,\" said Margaux Mennesson, a spokesperson for the group Safe Routes to School,\"the safer they are.\""}

Candor and consistency are not always public virtues. Torture is a crime against humanity, but coercion is an issue that is rightly handled with a wink, or even a touch of hypocrisy; it should be banned but also quietly practiced.\u201d) Bowden continues in this latest article to collect the facts that ought to lead to unequivocal condemnation of certain U.S. policies but cleverly presenting them in the end as ringing endorsements.\nThe story of David and Goliath is a \u201cparable about technology,\u201d but the problems with Bowden\u2019s telling of it begin with the fact that there is no slingshot in 1 Samuel 17 nor, actually, was a slingshot to be found anywhere on the planet in David\u2019s day. To place one in David\u2019s hands when he met Goliath 10 centuries before the Common Era is a wild anachronism at best. The \u201csmall, lightweight weapon that employs simple physics to launch a missile with lethal force from a distance\u201d cited as a biblical game changer did not exist before the invention of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear, patented in 1884. The slingshot is an innovation of the 19th century and Bowden might just as well have had David slay Goliath with a Hellfire missile or with Luke Skywalker\u2019s light-saber as give him a slingshot.\nDavid\u2019s weapon in 1 Samuel 17 was not a slingshot but a sling. Hardly an innovation, the sling had already been around for a long time and is thought to have been invented in the Upper Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, about the same time as the bow and arrow. David\u2019s sling was a primitive device for flinging stones. It was widely used by shepherds to ward off predators, a weapon of low prestige that justified Goliath\u2019s disdain.\nIt was Goliath, not David, who with his bronze armor and iron tipped spear brought the latest technological innovations to his last and fatal conflict. David himself is recorded in 1 Samuel 17 as saying \u201cAll those who are gathered here shall see that the Lord saves neither by sword or spear,\u201d and the message of this story is the reverse of the lesson Bowden offers.\nThe story of David\u2019s victory over Goliath is one of many in the pre and early monarchial biblical history wherein the latest military innovations are defeated by simple men, women and children improvising crude household and agricultural implements for use as weapons. Judges 4 tells of Jael, a Hebrew woman who killed Sisera, commander of \u201cnine hundred chariots of iron\u201d with a tent peg and wooden mallet. Sampson slaughtered a thousand armed Philistine soldiers with the jaw bone of a donkey (Judges 15). \u201cWhen war broke out (between the Hebrews and the Philistines) none of the followers of Saul and Jonathan had either sword or spear,\u201d we read in 1 Samuel 13, yet these insurgents armed with hoes, axes and shovels routed the most technically advanced"}

But as president, Trump\u2019s first foray into dealmaking failed miserably with the demise last week of the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWhat went wrong? Real estate deals and legislative deals are quite different \u2014 and Trump\u2019s business experience is ill-suited for work with Congress. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat is the \u2018art of the deal\u2019?\nTrump\u2019s book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d deals with business negotiations, in which the basic protocol involves alternating offers between negotiating partners. When you want to buy something, you make an offer below the asking price. Then the seller makes a counteroffer, and so on until the two offers converge.\nIn this process, one of the two parties may say the following. \u201cThis is my final offer. Take it or leave it.\u201d If the other party considers the statement credible, she makes the agreement with the terms offered. If not deemed credible, the parties continue to bargain, and the game continues (while the first player has lost his credibility).\nIn legislative bargaining, alternating offers are not part of the protocol. Nor do outside options exist. Indeed, despite news media suggestions that the president sets the legislative agenda with the State of the Union address, Congress sets its legislative agenda.\nIf a bill does not pass in Congress, the legislature can take up the initiative again, if it wishes to do so. And the president will most often wait until a bill clearing both chambers reaches his desk before he can sign or veto it. The president cannot directly intervene in the negotiations; whether the legislature is controlled by his party or the other party, he can act only behind the scenes.\nConsequently, it makes no sense to say to the other players, \u201cThis is your last chance. Take it or leave it.\u201d As a result, if you are the president and you make this statement, you\u2019re not credible. More accurately, you cannot possibly be credible because you do not directly control the agenda.\nThink about an alternative outcome on Obamacare repeal, in which House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) comes back in a month or a year with a new proposal that can pass both chambers. Would anybody expect the president to veto it? If not, what is the meaning of the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d statement?\nFurther, \u201coutside options\u201d don\u2019t exist in a legislature. The president cannot have several balls in the air. He does not have an alternative Congress. And alternative bills can be formally initiated only by Congress, not the president.\nGranted, the president and legislative leaders may negotiate, behind the scenes, about their priorities. And Republicans (at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue) surely discussed the order in which to introduce items on the agenda, like taxes, the wall, immigration, Obamacare and the environment. Such discussions probably concluded that Obamacare should go first, considering the more than 60 times the Republican House had voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act while Barack Obama was president. The GOP bill\u2019s failure means that Republicans will soon turn to the next item on their agenda.\nTrump\u2019s attempt to transpose his business experience directly to politics did not fare well. This is to be expected, because the games are different. You cannot play basketball with a tennis strategy.

One might not normally think of a producer of electricity as being particularly socially responsible, but PG&E generates more than half of its power from non-greenhouse-gas-emitting sources. 24% comes from nuclear, 16% comes from hydroelectric, and another 16% comes from other renewables like wind and solar.\nThe company even generates a modest amount of power from bovine emissions. Yes, you read that correctly. They harness the methane put off by cow manure.\nEven the company\u2019s more mainstream sources are moderately green. Natural gas, which accounts for 20% of PG&E\u2019s output, is certainly cleaner than coal or petroleum.\nTrue enough, California\u2019s strict green energy standards have a way of creating energy shortages in the state and driving up costs.

In that article Romanowsky claimed that he found a surprising fact: dark matter, which is thought to be surrounding galaxies across the universe, is absent from one type of galaxy known as an \"elliptical\" (or rounded) galaxy. Romanowsky's research puzzled physicists since, until that time, it was commonly thought that dark matter surrounds every galaxy in the universe and causes the further stars in each galaxy to move much faster then they would have normally.\nAvishai Dekel, Professor of Physics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, decided to address this cosmological puzzle. Drawing on highly advanced computer simulations he was able to calculate that, contrary to the 2003 paper, the stars in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies do not move slower than those in spiral galaxies. This suggests the existence of dark matter haloes surrounding elliptical galaxies similar to those surrounding spiral galaxies.\nThe reason why Romanowsky and his team believed elliptical galaxies do not posses dark matter haloes was because of observations which showed a slow movement of stars at the outskirts of elliptical galaxies contrary to the fast moving stars at the outskirts of spiral galaxies. The velocity of distant stars is measured using an effect called red shift (the reddening of light from a star that is moving away from us). The limitation of this method is that it is only possible to measure the component of velocity which is along the observer's line of sight.\nThis limitation would not be a problem if the orbits of the observed stars in the elliptical galaxies were randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight, as it was commonly assumed. However, the analysis performed by Professor Dekel and his team showed that the stars in elliptical galaxies that are farthest from the center are likely to be moving in elongated, eccentric orbits in such a way that most of their motion is perpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, they could be moving at high velocities without exhibiting much motion toward or away from the observers.\nThis phenomenon is the result of the way elliptical galaxies are formed as a violent merger of two spiral galaxies. ''In the merger process that produces these galaxies, a lot of the stars get flung out to fairly large distances, and they end up in highly elongated orbits that take them far away and then back, close to the center,'' explains Dekel.\nProfessor Dekel's research was based on simulations carried out by fellow researchersat the University of California, Santa Cruz. The simulations were conducted using the third fastest supercomputer in the worldthe NASA Columbia supercomputerwhich became operational in 2004. The Colombia supercomputer is built with 10,240 Intel Itanium 2 processors running at 1.5 gigahertz with 20 terabytes of shared memory and 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of shared storage space. This behemoth was used to calculate the violent collision and merger of the spiral galaxies that lead to the formation of the elliptical galaxies."}

As teen suicide rates rise by the year, who or what is to blame? Are the procedures used in our high schools successfully preventing teen suicide?\nIt\u2019s easy to put the blame on the teen, claiming they hide their emotions or they could have talked to us. It should not be the teen\u2019s full responsibility to get help when they need it. It shouldn't take a death for our schools to address this topic seriously.\nSome parents may argue that a child's emotional problems are a family issue, or that schools are inappropriate places to talk about death, but it really narrows down to saving a life.\nKids and teachers need to be educated about the warning signs of suicidal tendencies. Schools need to stop standing on the sideline and get involved. They need to try to foresee any suicidal risks from their students.\nTeach kids the seriousness of suicide and help them save a life."}
{"idx": "2999", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In related hydrogen breakthrough news, a team of scientists from Melbourne's Monash University has developed a new fuel cell prototype that could pave the way for a generation of much cheaper, more efficient fuel-cell vehicles. The results of their project, which was led by Maria Forsyth, a professor of materials engineering at the Australian Center of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, are published in the current issue of Science (sub. required).\nThe main obstacle to the mass production of hydrogen fuel cells has always been the high cost of platinum nanoparticles -- the small quantity contained within each cell typically adds $3500 to $4000 to the car's sticker price -- which are used to build the cell's air electrode. The electrode reduces oxygen and is thus a vital component of the fuel cell, helping in energy generation and storage. Aside from its high cost, platinum nanoparticles are also extremely difficult to find and have a nasty tendency to become inactivated by contact with carbon monoxide or by clumping together.\nTo get around these problems, Forsyth and her colleagues used an alternative oxygen reduction catalyst, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or PEDOT, for short (a type of polymer). Unlike its platinum counterpart, the PEDOT-based electrode did not become inactivated upon being exposed to CO; it was able to run continuously for 1500 hours and demonstrated oxygen conversion rates similar to those of Pt-based electrodes.\nCould cheaper fuel-cell vehicles be on the way?\nNot only did the new electrodes run well, they were also much cheaper to build and were more stable. Forsyth estimates that the cost of a PEDOT-based electrode would only add a few hundred dollars to the price of a fuel-cell vehicle. The scientists next plan on building a fuel cell prototype in 3D to maximize its surface area -- and thus the amount of current it can generate. Another application for the electrode would be in zinc air batteries, which are being used to store energy in vehicles."}
