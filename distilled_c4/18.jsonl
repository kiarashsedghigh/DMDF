But the rest of the population \"must accept that there is a growing proportion of Muslims in Germany.\"\nSchaeuble's remarks were a partial echo of what Charlotte Knobloch, former head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany and current President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, said in January. She said that attacks on Jews have become \"commonplace\" in Germany, while anti-Semitism \"has grown on the right and the left, in the Muslim community and also in the heart of German society.\"\nSchaeuble is not the first politician to voice concern over the issue. Stephan Harbarth, the deputy chairman of ruling CDU / CSU parliamentary group, said that ahead of the Holocaust Memorial Day on January 27, Berlin will \"resolutely oppose the anti-Semitism of migrants of Arab descent and those from African countries.\"\nAlso, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) have reportedly drafted a policy document, which seeks the deportation of immigrants rejecting Jewish life in Germany or questioning Israel's right to exist. A \"complete acceptance of the Jewish life\" is a \"criterion for successful integration,\"the document, seen by Die Welt, apparently reads."}

What can prevent people from overeating? Will people like beer with balsamic vinegar in it just because they\u2019ve been told it contains a \u201csecret ingredient\u201d?\nThese are some of the questions that Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University, has studied in his research over the years, which spans in scope from the weighty to the quotidian. He has attempted to puzzle out the intricacies of human motivation and decision making, and two threads that come up often in his research are why people so often make choices that leave them worse off, and how tweaking small things might ward off needless, irrational suffering.\nSo when he realized that reading and sending emails was consuming an ever-expanding portion of his time\u2014Ariely regularly receives hundreds of emails a day, excluding spam\u2014he wondered if there were something he and others could be doing differently in managing their online correspondence. What small behavioral tricks could he deploy to make the whole ordeal less stressful?\nOne feature of email that seemed to leave room for improvement is the fact that every new message, whether vitally urgent or completely worthless, warrants an immediate ping. This, despite the fact that most people have a hard time ignoring messages as they arrive. In a 2002 paper, for instance, researchers found that for 70 percent of messages, it took workers an average of only six seconds to react to a notification indicating an email was unread. (Perhaps, 15 years later, that average time has even gotten shorter.) And these interruptions come at a steep cost (in terms of both productivity and stress), as it takes a while Astoundingly, it\u2019s been estimated that it takes 25 minutes, on average, for a worker to return to a task after being interrupted\u2014this appears to hold true even for quick diversions, such as sending a single email. for people to return to the task they were originally doing when they were made aware of the message\u2019s arrival.\n\u201cThe first thing we should question is this idea that all emails are created equal,\u201d Ariely says. \u201cShould each email be able to interrupt people? Is the email from someone\u2019s boss as important as the weekly industry newsletter he\u2019s signed up for?\u201d To get a sense of the answer to these questions, he posted a survey on his blog asking respondents to review the last 40 emails they\u2019d received, saying for each one how long they could\u2019ve waited to read it: Right away? Two hours later? A week later? Never?\nWhat he found was that roughly a third of messages did not clear the bar of needing to be seen at all, and only about a tenth of emails were considered important enough to need to be read within five minutes of receipt.\nHow Soon Does Any Given Email Need to Be Seen?\nWhen asked to sort 40 recent emails by time-sensitivity, Ariely\u2019s respondents said that the majority were not urgent.\nIn this data, Ariely saw an inefficiency to target. Even though every email, by default, triggers a notification, it\u2019s unlikely that any given email deserves one. So, with the help of some software developers he\u2019d worked with in the past, he tried to come up with a way to tweak the default settings that are baked into email. The result of that work is Filtr, an app that lets users make simple rules, based on the sender, about when an email will show up in their inbox. For example,"}

But the small hospital in the mountains now relies on a single road to evacuate critical patients. A bad snowstorm could stop traffic and ground helicopters, leaving the hospital isolated.\nAs snow begins falling in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, the town at its doorstep, finds itself newly isolated.\nThe only year-round road into or out of Estes Park, Colo., now is the Peak to Peak Highway.\nIt traverses a jumble of mountains all the way. It's not the kind of road an ambulance can scream over at 60 miles an hour. \"Not while I'm in the back, hopefully,\" jokes paramedic Erle Collum.\nThe recent flooding in Colorado washed out the other two roads into town for miles at a stretch. That's bad news for Estes Park Medical Center, the town's only hospital.\nHelp from big city medical facilities that used to be an hour away is now more like three or four, via this single remaining road connecting the town to the rest of the world.\nCollom says he's grateful the town's ambulances have four-wheel drive.\n\"In the winter time we can get some pretty good snow around here, so it's a nice thing to have, just because of the area we work in,\" he says.\nIt's typical that there's snow on the ground from late September through April.\nEstes Park is a town of about 12,000, and it sees 3 million national park visitors a year. But the town's 25-bed hospital isn't set up to take care of critical cases for very long.\nCollom says at least one patient a day gets sent down the mountain to an urban hospital for more advanced care. And not everyone stable enough for the old hour-long ambulance ride will be able to take one stretching four hours or more.\n\"They're not the best roads anyway, so I suspect it'll complicate things when winter finally comes around,\" he says.\nThe hospital already makes pretty frequent use of helicopters for the trip to larger hospitals. There's no place for airplanes to land, and mountain weather keeps helicopters grounded about half the time in winter, says Bill Collins, a paramedic who flies helicopter missions into Estes Park.\n\"You're basically kind of like being in the center courtyard of a castle, and the castle walls are the mountains,\" he says.\nBefore, the hospital could usually count on either an ambulance or a helicopter as the failsafe. Now, a blizzard that makes air travel dangerous and closes the remaining road could cut off the town. So Dr. Martin Koschnitzke, the hospital's medical director, worries about possible life and death situations, like a premature birth. Premature babies need an intensive care unit, and there is none in Estes Park.\nThat means doctors have to pump air by hand into the preemie's lungs until it can get to an ICU with a special ventilator.\n\"I don't know how long our pediatricians could manage that baby here, I've seen them do it for multiple hours, I'd never want to see them do that for multiple days,\" he says.\nAnd, he says there's nothing worse than not being able to get a patient to needed care.\nWith an uncertain winter coming, Estes Park hospital CEO Bobbi Swenson has to figure out a budget"}

For one, the decline of New Jersey's gaming industry has been years in the making and was hastened when lawmakers in neighboring Pennsylvania, a key Atlantic City market, allowed casino gaming. Atlantic City casino revenue reached a peak of $5.2 billion, and tumbled to $2.86 billion last year nearly two dozen casinos were built within driving distance of the Jersey shore gambling mecca.\nSecond, as an economic activity, sports betting isn't a game-changer. According to data from the American Gaming Association, a trade group, about $3.4 billion was wagered on sports at casinos in Nevada in 2012, though the total amount generated by the state's casinos race books was much smaller. The AGA pegs the gross gaming revenue from sports bets at $170 million, a tiny percentage of the $10.9 billion consumers plunked down in the state's casinos in 2012.\nA further damper on sports betting profits at Atlantic City casinos is the fact that it's legal in Delaware and a handful of other states.\n\"I don't think it's going to be the lifeline for the casinos,\" said Alex Bumazhny, who follows the casino industry for Fitch Ratings, adding that the credit rating agency \"doesn't think it will make a big difference\" in Atlantic City.\nUnder a measure New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed into law last week, Atlantic City racetracks and casinos can start accepting sports bets. But that law comes amid a major slump in gambling in the state. Over the past few months, operators of the Revel Casino Hotel, which at one time was touted as linchpin of an Atlantic City revival, Trump Plaza and Showboat, closed their doors. The Trump Taj Mahal has threatened to shut down next month unless it receives concessions from state officials.\nEarlier this month, Brookfield Asset Management, owner of Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, acquired Revel for $110 million, a fraction of the $2.4 billion to build. Casino industry experts have argued that it will be difficult for Brookfield to operate Revel as a casino because it never made a profit. Florida developer Glen Straub, who submitted the losing bid, is challenging the sale.\n\"The reality is that it's a big deal for Monmouth Park and that's it,\" said Alan Woinski, the president of Gaming USA, a consulting firm based in Paramus, New Jersey, in an interview, referring to a struggling race track in Oceanport, New Jersey, that under the state's new law will be able accept sports bets. \"This whole thing is a snow job.\"\nAnother obstacle is that New Jersey residents are divided over the benefits of sports betting. Though 44 percent of people surveyed by Rutgers-Eagleton poll thought that sports betting was a positive for Atlantic City, another 48 percent were less sure of its value, while another 31 percent thought it would make no difference.\nStill, sports betting is starting up in New Jersey despite ferocious competition from a number powerful interests. Professional sports leagues in the U.S. and the NCAA have long opposed sports gambling because of fears it would lead to game-fixing.

Arnold resigned last year, and was convicted of ethics charges stemming from the allegations in May.\nStumbo successfully moved the court to dismiss him from the suit in December, arguing that Stumbo and the LRC, which is also named as a defendant \u201care indistinguishable \u2026 and naming them both is unnecessary,\u201d according to the Dec. 5, 2013 order issued by Judge Thomas Wingate.\nBut the new motion argues that because the LRC and the Kentucky House should be considered as the plaintiffs\u2019 joint employer, Stumbo should be remitted as a defendant.\n\u201cWe are confident that the court\u2019s well-reasoned order from last December will stand,\u201d Anna Whites, an attorney for Stumbo, said in a statement provided to Kentucky Public Radio on Thursday.\n\u201c[As] Speaker of the House of Representatives, he should be considered either a joint employer of the plaintiffs along with the LRC, or the LRC and the House of Representatives should be considered a single employer,\u201d David Ward, an attorney representing the women, said in a phone interview Friday.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 motion also argues that the LRC should be held liable for Arnold\u2019s actions under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act even if the court determines that Arnold isn\u2019t technically an LRC employee. Attorneys for the LRC maintain that Arnold isn\u2019t an LRC employee, and that the LRC should not be held liable for his actions.\nThe motion also seeks to rebuke the LRC\u2019s claims that it is entitled to immunity. The motion argues that legislative immunity only applies to lawmakers conducting official legislative duties.\nThe women are seeking compensation for embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish and retaliation, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees.\nA hearing on the motion will be heard in Franklin Circuit Court on Monday."}

Hence, Innovation is mandatory to continue in the game and Innovation is the best way to win. Innovation is not a separate, discrete activity but the duty of everyone in a leadership position to bring it as a total corporate strategy and as an organizational culture.\nThis is how, authors, A. G. Lafley, CEO, P&G and Ram Charan have written in their powerful book \u2018GAME CHANGER\u2019 while talking about how Innovation is directly correlated to collective intelligence of people in an organization to increase productivity. In today\u2019s corporate world, it's natural for people to collaborate and share ideas and unlock the collective intelligence, even when no one requires them to do so. These informal social networks, working on mutual self-interest can unleash creativity and mobilize collective expertise across the organization. But is it possible in the era of globalization, how to bring in the collective intelligence of thousands of globally placed employees of an organization to drive it to new heights?\nConnectbeam, a Mountain View, California based provider of enterprise social software applications, is leading the charge in this area. Thanks to the new avatar of the Internet, web 2.0 and social computing for creating new \u2018villages\u2019 every day for linking up like-minded people to talk and do things. Now, Innovative products designed by Connectbeam, leveraging some of the lessons and learnings of social media in the consumer space, are being adopted by corporations to unleash a level of employee collaboration, and creation and sharing of ideas that has never been seen before.\nPeople use social computing to connect to each other. But connecting for the purpose of collective intelligence development is not an easy task within an enterprise. Web 2.0 tools like blogs and wikis are not for everyone inside an organization, resulting in information that is often left trapped inside these \u2018point\u2019 application silos. Though these were getting adopted in the enterprises, they could not win mass adoption due to these limitations. Most employees have neither the time nor the inclination to write blog entries. For internal use, most enterprises found the collaborative authoring, organization and versioning capabilities of wikis more useful than the personal publishing of blogs.\nBut soon even wikis witnessed very slow adoption rate. As for the end users, an application must be complimentary enough to work with existing IT infrastructure \u2013 so that it does not disrupt their day-to-day workflow. ConnectBeam recognized the potential of Universal Social Bookmarking and Tagging as the effective solution that did not suffer from these symptoms. Puneet Gupta, Founder and CEO, Connectbeam says, \u201cWe found that adoption rates of blogs and wikis were too low, and we looked to understand the reasons behind this slow adoption. We zeroed in on two key reasons when looking at the enterprise user. First, there was a steep learning curve for users with both of these technologies, and second, users did not really want yet another destination to go to, to do their work. We felt that Social Bookmarking and Tagging could leap past these limiting symptoms, and deliver an even more powerful collective intelligent store of user generated content. \u201d Because employees tag documents or share bookmarks, a collective intelligent map of \u2018what was useful to whom, and in what context\u2019, can be built. \u201cFurther, we could keep track of the people of tagged information whereby the system would dynamically keep track of employee expertise, sorting into groups those who know a lot about a particular topic,\u201d he adds.\nWe all know how to bookmark our favorite websites or information on the Web.

It\u2019s one of the top things that people tell me they want to manage or \u201cget rid of.\u201d In our society, we believe that stress is \u201cbad\u201d and that we need to \u201cget rid of \u201d or \u201cmanage\u201d it, but we can create a new awareness from the positive aspects of stress. When I work with people who have stress, I begin by helping them change their perceptions of it.\nIn my corporate training classes on stress-relief, I always ask, \u201cWhy do you stress?\u201d Usually, no one offers the answer I\u2019m looking for: \u201cI stress because I care.\u201d If you didn\u2019t care, you wouldn\u2019t stress. You likely care about doing a good job, being a responsible person, maintaining a good reputation or expectations you have about yourself, or keeping your standards high, to name a few. Part of being human is about caring \u2014 about ourselves, others and about how we operate in this world \u2014 and that is a good thing.\nThe latest studies show that changing our perception of stress changes how stress affects us physically and mentally. Did you know that the hormones released from stress response boost memory performance, facilitate mental toughness, deepen social bonds (when we are stressed, we call our friends and share our challenges or complain to co-workers about the same things), help us to get ahead in life and get things done, strengthen our priorities and even cause an increase in the speed at which the brain processes information?\nAfter being tested and rated on their mental and physical discomfort, a group of stressed people was divided into two. One group was shown a video detailing the research and results on the negative aspects of stress, and the other was shown a video detailing all the positive aspects.\nOne week later, they were brought in to be retested and the group that saw the video of the positive aspects of stress showed a 23 percent decrease in physical symptoms (fatigue, backache, headache and mental discomfort). They gained a new perspective when it came to stress and created a more positive outlook in stressful situations. Use this information to your advantage by finding all the ways that stress benefits you.\nStress is symbolically represented in our homes by electricity.

So, contrary to the belief that environmentalists are holding up thinning projects, I agree with the need to thin the Highly flammable fine fuels, especially near populated areas.\nIn fact, that is exactly what the appeals are about. All are premised on the need to protect wildlife, watersheds and communities by carrying out legitimate thinning projects that honestly reduce risk of future wildfires. Instead, we continue to see industrial grade timber sales falsely labeled as thinning projects. It is still the large fire-resistant (and commercially valuable) trees that are being cut, while the small diameter materials that actually fuel wildfires are left untouched.\nGetting the agency to tell the truth about this has struck a nerve, as evidenced by the current disinformation campaign claiming environmentalists are blocking thinning projects. Not true. The appeals would stop if the agency would stop pushing projects that harm endangered wildlife and increase risk of wildfires.\nIt is important to remember how politics and timber industry campaign contributions drive national forest management. When timber sales are approved, the Forest Service all but gives the trees away, typically under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d the forest. Because taxpayers cover most expenses, profits can be substantial. The timber company is free to use these profits to fund campaigns of congresspersons like Wally Herger, who consistently votes to fund the agency with more tax dollars, thus assuring the next round of timber sales.\nThese sales again will take the large, profitable, fire resistant trees, leaving slash and unthinned trees to fuel future fires. Lately, however, extraneous costs of these schemes have soared into the billions as inferno-like fires consume the small trees, brush and logging slash.\nFearing their cash cow is about to expire, the Forest Service and some politicians are desperate to find someone to blame.

Last week the group turned against two of its former members and published personal information about them, saying they were responsible for computer crimes and encouraging the FBI to investigate. LulzSec was angry because it believed the two had published chat logs exposing some of its inner workings.\nOne of those two, who uses the hacker names [redacted] and m_nerva, was a resident of Hamilton, Ohio -- the town where Monday's search warrant was executed.\nLulzSec has been the target of an international law enforcement search after the group hacked websites belonging to U.K. Serious Organised Crime Agency, the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service, Sony, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and several FBI-affiliated groups.\nIt was this mounting pressure from law enforcement that finally caused LulzSec to disband, said E.J.

The Supreme Court shared that technology-lite view of the case, holding that Aereo \"looks like cable TV\" (as dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia scornfully put it) and therefore should be treated as such by the law. If it's cheap broadcast TV you're after, putting up an antenna is a fine solution. Provided that you can put an antenna on your roof. And you're not in an urban canyon or some other place with lousy reception.\nBut to its customers, Aereo wasn't just a low-cost way to watch local stations. It was a way to watch live TV through the Internet anywhere in the local stations' local broadcasting area. It made TV mobile and viewable on a wide range of devices. Yes, for some it was a solution to bad reception, particularly for apartment-dwellers. But those folks had access to cable TV and its less-expensive broadcast-only tier, and they wanted Aereo instead. What does that tell you?\nOK, in part it tells you that cable companies charge way too much for their \"limited basic\" offerings. Time Warner Cable charges about $24 a month in Los Angeles, Comcast about $30 in San Francisco \u2014 that's three to four times Aereo's $8 monthly charge, and it doesn't include such add-ons as the fees for the set-top boxes customers may need to actually tune in the programming.\nBut it also says that people want to watch TV on their tablets, laptops and smartphones, and the broadcasters' offerings to date just don't cut it. For example, Hulu doesn't permit live TV viewing, and it doesn't offer the local broadcasters' local programs (such as the nightly news). Same for the networks' websites.\nFor their part, broadcasters seem hell-bent on making life even more inconvenient for viewers in the name of protecting the retransmission fees they extract from cable and satellite operators. For example, in addition to delaying when an episode will appear online, some have been extending the delay even further for those who aren't cable subscribers. Because, you know, people who aren't cable subscribers are happy to wait longer to watch a show on a legitimate, advertiser-supported platform, instead of streaming it immediately from an illegal one without ads.\nThis sort of issue has cropped up in every industry struggling to come to grips with the transition from analog to digital. Industry executives live in fear that new digital options will cannibalize their existing revenue streams. Eventually, though, they recognize that new digital options can cater to an audience that isn't"}

Miller averaged 25 carries for the first three games.\nConsider that in his four seasons with the Dolphins, Miller had 20 or more carries in a game only twice. In fact, Miller averaged just 10.4 carries for his Dolphins career. In his first season with the Texans last year, Miller averaged 19.1 carries \u2014 but his per-carry average matched his career low of 4.0 yards.\nAlthough Miller finished 2016 with a respectable 1,073 yards, his production dropped as the season went on, whether due to fatigue or injuries (Miller had several). He averaged 4.6 yards in those first three games but 3.3 in the final four. Compare that to Miller\u2019s best season in Miami, when he averaged 5.1 yards on 216 attempts for 1,099 yards.\nWhile O\u2019Brien won\u2019t take the ultraconservative approach of Joe Philbin (no surprise), it\u2019s clear Miller will have an opportunity to have fresher legs come next December and January.\nCould $8 million a season keep Kenny Stills with Miami Dolphins?"}
{"idx": "18036", "prompt": "Continue the following text: CNET's video experts take an in-depth look at the PlayStation 3's new DVD-upscaling features.\nBefore yesterday's firmware update, the PlayStation 3 couldn't upscale standard-definition DVDs to high-def resolutions--a once high-end feature that's now built-in to nearly all DVD players with HDMI outputs. But what's the real benefit of upscaling (or upconverting, as it's also known)? Despite some of the marketing hype claiming that upscaling will make your DVDs appear in true high-def quality, the increase in picture quality will never come close to matching that of native HD material (HDTV broadcasts, HD DVD, and Blu-ray). Moreover, the video quality improvement is completely dependent on how good the upscaling and deinterlacing technology in your TV already is. Every HDTV is already capable of upscaling and deinterlacing; the only benefit an upscaling DVD player can bring to the table is to do it better. In some cases, the difference is easily discernible. In others, it's much more subtle. Ultimately, an upscaling DVD player might be able to make your DVDs look better, but the difference will be worth it only to \"critical viewers\" who pay close attention to image quality.\nAs the PS3 formerly did a pretty poor job of just deinterlacing DVD to 480p, there was a lot of room for improvement. We put the PS3 through Silicon Optix's HQV test suite in 1080p mode on our Pioneer Pro-FHD1 reference display. For the most part, we were satisfied. It passed the initial resolution test, which means it can display the full resolution of DVDs. The next tests didn't go as well. For example, we saw artifacts on third line on the test with three shifting lines. We've seen better performance on this test on players with HQV processing, such as the Toshiba HD-XA2, or even with the older Denon DVD-3910. On the other hand, the PS3 did a decent job with a waving flag, as there were definitely some slightly noticeable jaggies, but we've seen worse. It did even better on the 2:3 pulldown processing test, as it kicked into film mode almost immediately.\nTest patterns performance is fine for the lab, but we also took a look at some actual movies. The introduction to Seabiscuit can be difficult for some players, but the PS3 handled it well, with only a few slight artifacts--occasionally we could see some flashing behavior in the old photos as the camera panned over them. We also watched a bit of King Kong, which looked fantastic (as it does on almost all DVD players).\nThe bottom line is that the PS3's upscaling is pretty good, although it doesn't compare to top-of-the-line players such as the Oppo DV-981HD or the new high-def disc players with HQV processing, such as the Samsung BD-P1200 and the Toshiba HD-XA2. On the other hand, the PS3's DVD performance is definitely a big step up from that of the Xbox 360 Elite. In the final analysis, when you consider that upscaling is just one of the many functions of the PS3, we think the performance is pretty impressive.\nAnother resolution issue worthy of note: it appears the 1.80 firmware update has fixed the 720p issue on the"}

Since then, a patchwork of measures has been tried, including isolated investigations conducted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland\u2019s Historical Enquiries Team, the Office of the Police Ombudsman, and various coroners\u2019 inquests; but each has had a narrow remit and has left families with more questions than answers.\nDuring Northern Ireland\u2019s \u2018troubles\u2019 more than 3,600 people were killed and over 40,000 injured. In most cases, no one has ever been held responsible. Amnesty has spent the last two years hearing from victims and families who are desperate to get to the truth of who was responsible for policies such as \u2018shoot to kill\u2019 and to gain some closure on a conflict which still casts a shadow over the present. Families spoke to Amnesty about being presented with version after version of the \u2018truth\u2019, and never knowing definitively what had happened.\nThe tensions in modern-day society in Northern Ireland, exemplified by controversy over parades and flags, demonstrate the need to think again about how the past is dealt with. Amnesty wants to see a new, overarching investigative mechanism, one which looks at the situation as a whole and is not limited by the narrow remits of previous investigations.\nPoignantly, the bereaved families and those injured in the Omagh bombing have already been driven to commission their own report in their desperate quest for answers. Nevertheless, it has left them with yet more unanswered questions about responsibility for the attack, and today\u2019s announcement seems a cruel rejection of their plea for justice.\n\"It\u2019s said they are waiting for us to die out. But the next generation will still keep asking questions about what happened.\n\"Look at me: it was my grandfather who was killed, and I am still going to keep asking for the truth.\"\nThere is a cruel irony in the fact that Northern Ireland is held up as a success story when many victims' families actually consider their treatment a profound failure.\nTruth belongs to the victors, it is said.

He didn't know much about Aundray Bruce, who the Falcons selected No. 1 in 1988.\nThat's probably a good thing since Bruce, kindly put, didn't live up to his draft position, although he did last for 11 seasons. While Curry wasn't precise on the particulars, he knows he wants to rewrite history and be the No. 1 pick next month.\n\"To go No. 1 is a crazy feeling,\" Curry said Monday at Wake Forest's pro day.. \"I've been working hard for a long time to go No. 1.\"\nCurry might be working against a lot more than the ghost of Bruce's career. Linebackers aren't valued as highly as quarterbacks, defensive ends and offensive tackles when it comes to the top draft spot. Last season's Defensive Player of the Year, linebacker James Harrison, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even drafted.\nThe ways of the NFL can be maddening.\nThere are very good offensive tackles, defensive ends and quarterbacks in the 2009 draft. But Curry, the 2008 Butkus Award winner as the nation's top linebacker, is viewed as the most well-rounded prospect. He's not only a safe pick but someone who can provide an immediate identity to a defense.\n\"He's the best of everyone out there,\" an NFC scout said at Monday's workout. \"You know what you are getting with him. He plays hard every day. He doesn't have bad games. He doesn't make many mistakes.\"\nThe best player might not always be the right player.\nThe Detroit Lions, whose tissue-paper defense played a huge factor in their 0-16 season, sure could use someone like Curry (6-foot-2, 250). They just traded for outside linebacker Julian Peterson and they have Ernie Sims, but Curry, an outside linebacker at Wake Forest, can also play middle linebacker. He's got the build, the smarts and the toughness to be the cog.\nHe just might not be what the Lions want.\nLB Aaron Curry, shown here at the combine, faces an uphill battle to go No. 1 overall.\nDetroit has already had Curry in for a private interview. While he is on the team's short list of potential picks, the Lions are also exploring quarterbacks Matthew Stafford and Mark Sanchez and offensive tackles Jason Smith and Eugene Monroe. As badly as Detroit needs defensive players, offense could be the path it takes with the first pick.\nHow would Curry deal with not going No. 1?\n\"I would take the Adrian Peterson approach,\" he said about the Vikings' Pro Bowl running back, who was selected seventh overall in 2007. \"When he was picked, any team that passed him up he was going to punish them. That's the mindset I have.\"\nCurry has already met privately with the Lions and said he has personal interviews/workouts set up with St. Louis (No. 2 pick), Kansas City (No. 3), Seattle ("}

Speaking late last month, he warned of further cuts in U.S. aid to Bolivia, which has been slashed by two-thirds.\nBolivia\u2019s vice minister for coca, Felipe Caceres, has dismissed the U.N. findings as \u201cnot true.\u201d He concedes that \u201ceradication is past history\u201d but insists that the government has made progress in \u201cinterdiction\u201d and \u201crationalizing\u201d coca cultivation.\nMr. Morales, a former coca grower with strong backing from Andean Indians who have historically cultivated the plant for traditional purposes, won the 2005 election on a promise to stop U.S.-sponsored eradication programs.\nWhile pledging to allow some coca farming for commercial and traditional purposes \u2014 it has been used as an ingredient for soft drinks and anesthetics and has been chewed as a mild stimulant by Andean Indians for centuries \u2014 Mr. Morales promised to fight narcotics trafficking with stepped up interdiction and police measures.\nThe United Nations says the legal market accounts for about 13,000 tons of annual coca production while an additional 36,000 tons is going to illicit cocaine production.

{"idx": "18066", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Are management consultants no better than the charlatans of the Old West selling snake oil? In light of recent supply chain events, such as the discovery of faulty ignition switches in General Motors cars, I was particularly drawn to the discussion in Douglas Hubbard\u2019s book, The Failure of Risk Management, on how organizations ranging from the United States Government to large pharmaceutical companies can fail to adopt the most effective risk management methods despite their best efforts. Risks in the supply chain, after all, are highly relevant and can have disastrous consequences: wasted resources, the selection of a poor advertising agency, or even a fatal factory collapse in Bangladesh.\nHubbard is scathing when it comes to management consulting, likening the seemingly \u201cscientific\u201d methods adopted by organizations to reduce risk\u2014scorecards, Key Performance Metrics, and market assessments\u2014to using astrology to predict the future. How can a consultant brought in from the outside possibly understand all the intricacies of a business? And the so-called metrics used to evaluate suppliers? What about those infamous RFIs and RFPs? Aren\u2019t they just, well, arbitrary?\nI admit that Hubbard is quite convincing when he points out the dangers of putting too much stock in weighted scores and other metrics. He emphasizes that organizations should depend on strong quantitative analysis by making statistical inferences based on large samples and looking for direct causes and effects. But before we start panicking and overhauling supplier selection processes and discounting benchmarking, it\u2019s important to take a step back and note some points.\nFirst off, sourcing practices have evolved to be more robust than Hubbard asserts. When implementing sourcing strategies for clients, for example, firms make significant efforts to assess various data. They are also equipped with resources and tactics to reduce risk, such as reviewing a supplier\u2019s financial stability and actually looking at the effects of reducing costs (rather than just cutting costs). In procuring marketing services, for instance, consultants often work with the legal departments of both the client and the supplier to ensure that contractual obligations are met, and the actions to be taken if they are not.\nMoreover, there are several components involved in risk management, and many of these components are qualitative in nature. When it comes to risk management in supply, activities can also include forming strategic alliances, investigating buffer strategies, and assessing various process improvements. For a more specific example, see how business disruptions can be addressed in telecom and IT. Furthermore, as pointed out by Steve Culp in Forbes, in an environment of increasing geopolitical risk and globalized supply chains, it is important to engage in risk management strategies that evaluate the whole, not just the parts. The systemic nature of supply chain risks means that the entire organization can be affected in the event of a mishap; in large organizations, it\u2019s difficult for departments to have the resources or communication channels to see beyond their immediate day-to-day tasks. As stated by Yves Leclerc of West Monroe Partners, good risk management is \u201cboth a technology and business-process effort.\u201d Areas that need further improvement include gaining access to greater visibility, encouraging collaboration among supply chain partners, and breaking down the \u201csilos\u201d disrupting the flow of information within a company.\nAt the end of the day, CPOs have their work cut out for them. Rather than dismiss the resources in risk management off hand, organizations should work with their procurement teams to gather quantitative as well as qualitative information, and to use this data to build more comprehensive and creative frameworks to assess their sourcing strategies.\nI agree with much of what you have written and would further"}

Thinking scary mask, human skull rattle, thick grassy skirt and swirls of paint on skinny legs and bare feet?\nThinking of a superstitious belief in good and bad spirits and the need to placate or communicate with them?\nWhile modern practitioners of shamanism retain a sense of the ability to communicate with spirits in objects as diverse as plants, animals and even houses, these modern practitioners of shamanism don't look nearly as interesting as their forebears, says Jeffrey Rich.

Harner's 1980 book, \"The Way of the Shaman,\" helped inform modern shamanic practices.\nRich, since being introduced to the practices three years ago by some friends, has seen similar synchronicities - practitioners drumming together who come up with the same images, messages he receives about his own practices that he finds, later, to be common to one or more traditions or to his own Irish heritage.\n\"Shamanism is a way to come face-to-face with the daily miracle,\" Rich said.\nWith the introductory smudging complete, Rich began hitting his hand-held drum with the mallet and singing softly, using a tune he had been given in one of his meditative journeys.

Today we have two videos that very clearly explain about the iOS 7 Control Center and also the Notification Center.\nMany of us are starting to get used to the many changes and improvements as well as the new look with iOS 7, but it can be difficult to take it all in at first. iOS 7 is compatible with many existing iOS devices, and also with the just-released iPhone 5S and 5C, so there will be plenty of people trying to come to grips with the updated operating system.\nA few days ago we shared some videos with readers that neatly and succinctly described the Airdrop and Multitasking features. These were so popular that we thought we\u2019d also share today\u2019s videos about the Control Center and Notifications. We have embedded two short videos below this story about these features.\nThe first is a two-minute YouTube video about the Control Center with iOS 7. This is an excellent improvement to iOS and will give users instant access to the camera, timer, audio playback controls, Airdrop and Airplay.\nUsers can also adjust brightness, turn wireless services on and off and much more, all from one handy hub. The video clearly shows how to open up the Control Center with a swipe upwards on the screen and then details the many functions available from it.\nThe second video below is a brief look at the improved Notification Center. This informs users about missed calls, new mail, and much more and now has a Today feature. Users will only need to take a glimpse at their iPhone to get a look at the weather, what the traffic is like, and whether someone you know has a birthday.\nThe video shows how to access the Notification Center by swiping down the screen and also details the three tabs available, Today, All and Missed. The latter gives details of alerts you haven\u2019t yet dealt with, such as messages or missed calls.\nIf you\u2019ve already updated to iOS 7 then we hope that you are getting to grips with all the changes, and that these videos will be useful to you. There are some people though who have updated to iOS 7 and are having problems, and also some who have updated and don\u2019t like the new appearance of the revamped operating system. Overall though, we feel iOS 7 is a much-needed revamp, with some great new features and improvements.\nWhat are your thoughts on iOS 7? Are you happy with the new design? Are you pleased with what is offered by features such as the Control Center and Notification Center? Let us know with your comments."}

The Program Fee covers housing, some meals, program activities and trips and student services. For students in homestays, the Program Fee covers three meals every day: breakfast and dinner with the homestay family, and a daily lunch allowance. Those living in apartments will receive the same daily lunch allowance, but must provide for their own breakfasts and dinners. The estimated miscellaneous include medical costs, social activities, personal travels and incidental expenses. The actual spending will depend on individual student\u2019s life style and own spending habits.

What would you recommend I do?\nPeople are more likely to achieve their goals when the motivation comes from within rather than from external factors and perhaps your example could be one of the reasons why this is true. Try to remove your focus from your husband\u2019s dictates and change the focus to your personal goals. Your letter suggests that you are interested in improving your health.\nTherefore, rather than making weight loss your goal, shift it to health improvement.\nStart an exercise program if you have not already done so and get some advice from your physician or reputable websites on healthier ways to eat. Get a friend involved who could share in the activities or at least keep you accountable. Yes, weight loss is a likely side effect from these changes but you will be the one enjoying the improved health and wellbeing, regardless of what your husband thinks about your change in weight.\nI have been dating this guy for more than six years on an off but more on for the past three years. I love him and we got engaged a year ago. However, I recently discovered that he is married. My friends say that I should leave him but he keeps telling me that he plans to leave his wife. What should I do?\nI am sorry to hear about your predicament. You have been deceived and you have also been made an unwitting accomplice in causing distress to another woman. As hard as it may be I suggest you listen to your friends and take the high road. End your relationship with this man.\nFirstly, statistically speaking, it is highly unlikely that he will leave his wife and if he was indeed planning to leave her why did he lie to you about the relationship in the first place?\nFurthermore, do you really want to enter into a marriage with someone in which the foundation of your relationship was based on a lie? The road ahead will likely be difficult in the short term but I am confident in saying that it is a decision that you will be glad you made in the long run.\nI have been dating someone for 15 years and we have two beautiful children. I would really like to get married and have a stable family unit but my boyfriend keeps making excuses to avoid marriage. Do you think there is any hope for him ever changing his mind or should I move on?\nShould I stay or leave?\nI am happy that you are able to enjoy your two children as a result of the relationship but since your boyfriend has been unable to commit to marriage with you despite a 15-year relationship and children, it is highly unlikely that he will ever be able to provide that stable unit that you yearn for.\nIn short, even if he does change his mind the foundation of the union may not lead to the healthy, happy stable marriage that you desire. Whether or not you should stay is somewhat more complicated given your children. I suggest you ask yourself this question to help decide on the best next step. Do you think that continuing the relationship provides the healthiest environment for your children?

There\u2019s something that those wrestling fans already know that many movie fans may not be aware of however. The Rock is damn funny. The new movie Central Intelligence looks to combine these two skills into a single movie, and if that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s got one of the most popular comedians on the planet to back him up in the comedy department, Kevin Hart. Check out the film\u2019s first trailer.\nWe probably should have warned you about that scene at the end, it\u2019s more than a little creepy, sorry. In Central Intelligence Johnson plays a former high school nerd who reconnects with former hot shot Hart. In town for their high school reunion, \"Bob\" says he\u2019s now part of the C.I.A. He apparently needs Hart\u2019s character\u2019s accounting skills to break a case. It\u2019s at this point that we assume the shenanigans begin to ensue. Hart is along for the ride whether he likes it or not while Johnson appears to be enjoying himself risking life and limb.\nWhile the movie looks to be your standard \"buddy cop\" flick, even if one of them isn\u2019t actually a cop, it\u2019s the strength of the leads that will either make or break it. From this brief glimpse, the chemistry between Kevin Hart and The Rock looks to be solid. The Rock\u2019s confidence on screen is nearly always solid, and by exaggerating that for comedic effect, the character looks to be borderline crazy. Hart has played a very similar character before in Ride Along and will again in that movie\u2019s sequel. In fact, that may be the biggest problem that Central Intelligence may have. Ride Along 2 is due out in January, meaning we will have seen Hart play a very similar character twice, and once in the same year before this movie comes out.\nIt\u2019s good to see The Rock doing something funny again. While his resume hasn\u2019t been entirely devoid of comedy, nobody would argue that The Gameplan or The Tooth Fairy were comedic masterpieces. His best comedic role to date was probably his bit in Get Smart, which might have been a better film if he\u2019d been in more of it. Making fans laugh was a big part of what made him one of the most popular professional wrestlers in history, and hopefully this will be the movie that will make film fans laugh as well.\nHere\u2019s hoping that Central Intelligence turns out as funny as it looks.

In its annual review of the currency area, the Fund said that while the situation in Greece is \"fluid\" and \"a key source of uncertainty,\" the threat of contagion has eased since the early years of the currency area&apos;s debt crisis. However, the IMF warned that the eurozone faces longer-term speed limits to its economic growth that will see incomes fall further behind those in the U.S. over the coming five years unless governments take immediate action. \"Given the weak medium-term outlook, a stronger collective push is urgently needed to consolidate the recovery, raise potential growth, and strengthen the union&apos;s resilience,\" the IMF&apos;s economists said. The eurozone economy returned to growth in mid-2013, but has advanced only modestly since then. In the first quarter of this year, it expanded by 0.4%, and most indicators suggest that pace was maintained in the three months to June. At that rate, the IMF said inflation will be below the European Central Bank&apos;s target of just under 2% through 2020, while unemployment will stay high. The gap between output per person in the U.S. and the eurozone is already at its greatest since the currency was launched in 1999, and will widen further if nothing is done boost growth, the Fund predicted. Its economists said the ECB should proceed with its stimulus program at least until September 2016, the date it has tentatively set for completing its bond purchases. \"We think it is likely they will need to go beyond September 2016,\" said Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the IMF&apos;s European department. It also urged governments to take advantage of the \"windfall\" from the lower borrowing costs the ECB&apos;s program has delivered and other room for maneuver to increase spending and cut taxes, judging they could do so to the equivalent of 0.6% of the eurozone&apos;s combined gross domestic product without breaking the currency area&apos;s budget rules. In addition to those measures to stimulate demand, the IMF said governments should push ahead with reforms to labor markets that make it easier to hire and fire workers, and eliminate distinctions between those with very high and very low levels of job security. The Fund also urged the eurozone&apos;s new, shared bank supervisor to lead \"a more aggressive, top-down strategy\" that writes down or restructures bad--or nonperforming--loans held by banks. Figures released Monday showed banks raised their lending to businesses by just 0.1% in June from a year earlier. \"Europe&apos;s experience contrasts sharply with that of the U.S. recently and Japan in the 2000s where, after their financial crises, aggressive NPL resolution helped support a faster recovery in credit,\" it said. Taken together, the Fund said those steps would raise economic growth to 2.7% and 3.0% for 2015 and 2016 respectively, from the 1.5% and 1.7% it now forecasts.

I want to explain a little bit about why that has happened.\nLast year, Google launched its own podcast app for Android users - they\u2019ve also said they will launch a browser version for computers soon. Google has since begun to direct people who search for a BBC podcast into its own podcast service, rather than BBC Sounds or other third party services, which reduces people\u2019s choice - an approach that the BBC is not comfortable with and has consistently expressed strong concerns about. We asked them to exclude the BBC from this specific feature but they have refused.\nAs a public service, we want our content and services to be available to as many people as possible and we make these available for free on a range of third-party apps. But as the BBC, funded by the licence fee payers in the UK, we have to ensure it is done in a way that is good for all audiences, according to our Distribution Policy - which has been agreed with Ofcom.\nWhat we think is important is pretty simple. We want people to have easy access to the wide range of BBC programmes, not just a select few, and be able to discover and listen to new ones really easily.\nIn the UK we have a creative and flourishing radio and podcast industry and the BBC plays a significant part in this, which we\u2019re really proud of. So we want to make sure podcasts made in, and championing the UK, are prominent on global platforms. We also want to make our programmes and services as good as they can possibly be - this means us getting hold of meaningful audience data. This helps us do a number of things; make more types of programmes we know people like, make our services even more personalised and relevant to people using them, and equally importantly, identify gaps in our commissioning to ensure we\u2019re making something for all audiences.\nUnfortunately, given the way the Google podcast service operates, we can\u2019t do any of the above.\nWe don\u2019t like removing our content from services and certainly don\u2019t do it lightly - but unfortunately until Google changes the way they look at this, for the good of listeners, our podcasts will not be available on some of their services. We are in discussions with Google to try and resolve the situation and will continue to work with them to try and come to a solution that\u2019s in the best interests of all listeners.\nIt\u2019s been a few days since I posted on here, and have been reading your comments since then. I thought it would be helpful to respond to some of these.\nFirst, a couple of you have asked about our approach to Google compared with other third-party podcast apps and services out there.\nAs I mentioned, Google recently decided to change their approach so that their search engine only links you to their own app for instant playback of podcasts, rather than providing a choice. This is very different to other providers - who make it clear where podcasts are to be played, with many of them giving you options about where to play them. What Google has done doesn\u2019t seem fair.\nWe asked Google to address the issue and not make the change until we could both work out a satisfactory alternative - but they wouldn\u2019t. The only option they\u2019ve given us is to no longer make our podcasts available on a range of Google services.\nWe\u2019re continuing to have conversations with Google - where we are putting a number of practical solutions to them. We hope this will lead to a resolution very soon and will provide you with any updates when we have them.\nSecond, a couple of you have suggested that"}

This week\u2019s feature is a dramatic effort from first time director Aaron Schneider called Get Low. As a first time director, Mr. Schneider couldn\u2019t possibly have asked for a better cast than he received in this depression-era piece. Oscar winner and perennial Hollywood icon Robert Duvall (Apocalypse Now, Secondhand Lions, as well as a gajillion other outstanding movies over the last three decades) plays the lead role of Felix Bush, a crotchety old hermit who has spent the majority of his life in seclusion and earned a frightful reputation with the local townsfolk. During one of his rare forays into town, Felix learns of the death of another hermit and begins to consider his own mortality. Felix knows there are many outlandish stories about him, and he wonders just what everyone really thinks of him. Also, Felix has been in self-imposed exile for most of his life under the guilty burden of a terrible secret that he desperately wants to air out before his own inevitable demise.\nFelix decides that he will plan his own funeral, but he will attend it while he is still alive! Felix wants to know what others think of him, so he decides to invite anyone who has a story to tell about him. He offers a local reverend played by Gerald McRaney (best known for his roles on TV\u2019s Simon and Simon and Major Dad) a large sum of money to host his premature funeral. The Preacher is uncomfortable with the idea of a living funeral, and he is also concerned because of the rumors that surround Felix, so he declines the invitation. While mentioning the idea, Felix is overheard by a local man named Buddy played by Lucas Black (Legion, Jarhead). Buddy is a kind soul who wants the old man\u2019s wishes to be honored, so he takes the idea to his boss, the down-on-his-luck and unscrupulous local funeral director Frank Quinn, played expertly by another of Hollywood\u2019s All-Stars, Bill Murray (What About Bob?, Ghostbusters, and you know the rest\u2026) . Quinn immediately senses an opportunity for financial gain, and goes about organizing the funeral party for Felix.\nSince he is a hermit, and since he has a less than favorable reputation, Felix decides that he will raffle off his 300 acres of land for a lucky attendee to inherit upon his death. This ensures that a large crowd will attend Felix\u2019s funeral party, and indeed a large amount of people turn out. The true motivation for the party is for Felix to clear his conscience of a terrible secret he has harbored for nearly 40 years, one which is known only by another preacher in a different town who once heard his confession a long time ago. Bill Cobbs (Ghosts of Mississippi, The Hudsucker Proxy) plays Reverend Charlie Jackson, and he too is reluctant to attend what he thinks will be a shallow spectacle and an embarrassment for his old friend. Felix has second thoughts about his plan, but unwilling to take a loss, Quinn uses all of his sly abilities to keep the funeral party on schedule. Felix\u2019s shocking confession is most relevant to an old woman named Mattie Darrow, played by Sissy Spacek (Carrie, Tuck Everlasting). Long ago, Felix and Mattie had a unique relationship which ended abruptly when the tragedy Felix has been keeping secret for so long separated them. Felix desperately wants Mattie to know the truth, but he is unsure if he will be able to tell her"}

Though it was made for a modest $90 million, the film not only manged to pull in the low sum of $21 million domestically, but was an international disappointment too, pulling in only $48 million globally by the time in left theaters. It's hard to say exactly why the film was unsuccessful, but apparently if you ask Arnold Schwarzenegger the reason was because he wasn't in it - and now he's doing something about that.\nDeadline has gotten word that Universal Pictures is now planning to make The Legend of Conan and has attached Schwarzenegger to star. The new movie will be the third time that the former Governor of California has taken on the role, having played it in both the original Conan The Barbarian as well as Conan The Destroyer, and will be the first time he's done so since 1984. Chris Morgan, who is best known for his work as a screenwriter for the Fast and the Furious franchise, is attached to the project as a producer, and it's possible that he will be handling the script as well. The only problem with that plan is that Morgan is currently attached to write the seventh installment of the long-running racing franchise, and that might conflict with Universal's plans to get the movie ready for release in summer 2014.\nDiscussing the project with the site, producer Fredrik Malmberg, who is producing the new movie and owns the rights to Conan through his Paradox Entertainment banner, said, \"The original ended with Arnold on the throne as a seasoned warrior, and this is the take of the film we will make. It\u2019s that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king, warrior, soldier and mercenary, and who has bedded more women than anyone, nearing the last cycle of his life. He knows he\u2019ll be going to Valhalla, and wants to go out with a good battle.\"\nThe reboot will ignore both the recent remake as well as Conan The Destroyer, but will directly link to the 1982 original. It's unknown at this time if the new sequel will be aiming for an R-rating, but according to the trade \"they won\u2019t flinch from the hardness of the period depicted in that first film.\"\nSaid Schwarzenegger in a statement about the project, \"I always loved the Conan character and I\u2019m honored to be asked to step into the role once again. I can\u2019t wait to work with Universal and the great team of Fredrik Malmberg and Chris Morgan to develop the next step of this truly epic story.\""}

Instead, the case seems set to become another example of the court chipping away at the death penalty by overturning extreme practices around the edges.\nThe case concerns Duane Buck, an African-American man sentenced to death by a Texas jury in 1997.

FARC\u2019s insurgency cannot be understood discerning from agrarian conflicts during the 1920s-1930s and from the period of La Violencia.\nBefore FARC\u2019s foundation, Colombian peasants started to organize self-defense movements that tried to break the bipartite system of hegemony.

According to Gilhdoes, during the 1920s and the 1930s there were three kinds of agrarian conflicts in Colombia: disputes around the distribution of lands, issues related to indigenous communities, and tensions between landowners and their workers due to labor conditions. In such an environment of social and economic tensions, peasants and natives created unions and self-defense organizations to protect their interests.\nThe local and low-intensive conflicts became a national political crisis in April 1948 when Jorge Gait\u00e0n was killed in Bogot\u00e0. Gait\u00e0n was a charismatic populist leader of a minority within the Liberal Party. He offered hope to the poorest of both urban and rural areas, leading campaigns to promote agrarian reforms and to defend peasants against state violence. He was able to gain the support of discontented middle classes and poorer ones. After his murder, the PCC declared armed resistance against state terrorism as legitimate. Subsequently, the PCC became instrumental in the rise of peasant self-defense movements.\nWhat is not clear is the role of PCC in FARC\u2019s foundation. While LeGrand argues that Bloque Sur was composed by members of the Communist Party and Liberal Party, Brittain suggests that the Liberal Party did not actively participate in FARC\u2019s formation. As confirmed by several studies, the FARC were formed by members of self-defense groups with elements of the Communist Party. William Avil\u00e9s argues that the FARC \u201cemerged under the leadership of the Communist Party and operated with the support of peasants who sought refuge from the repression of la Violencia.\u201d According to Leong\u00f2mez, the FARC was \u201cborn as a reaction against the foundation of the ELN and EPL\u201d by the PCC.

It was a simple hint \u2013 the inclusion of a character called \u2018Le Chiffre\u2019, translated simply as \u2019The Cipher\u2019 or \u2018a code\u2019.\nFour years later, Fleming got braver. McKay believes the author was inspired by a chess game from 1954, which saw top code breaker and chess player Conel Hugh O\u2019Donel Alexander take on David Bronstein, a Soviet chess grandmaster.\nThe game, which saw Alexander \u201cfloor\u201d his opponent, was widely covered by national press. It was also watched by a number of Soviet agents, who hid themselves in the audience to make sure none of their team defected.\n\u201cIt is no surprise that just a couple of years after Alexander played chess, the 007 novel From Russia, With Love featured a key chess scene,\u201d McKay told The Telegraph.\nThe chess game used in the 1963 film may also have been inspired by a match between Bronstein and Boris Spassky, a Soviet world champion.\nThere was a second teaser in the novel too; Bond was on the trail of an encryption machine that was \u201cnot a million miles away from the old Enigma\u201d.\nLater, in You Only Live Twice, the fictional Japanese coding system is \u201cremarkably close to the real life one\u201d.\nMcKay, who latest book The Spies of Winter explores what happened at Bletchley once the war was over, said Fleming easily got away with his blatant neglect of the Official Secrets Act, which is signed by those involved in sensitive operations, because the \u201cordinary person\u201d \u2013 and the majority of Government officials \u2013 would not have thought the details were true.\n\u201cHe would have known the Bletchley Park hierarchy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe got away with it because, of course, only he and the senior directors knew.

The city is distinctly orderly, with landscaping reminiscent of Japanese gardens and \u201cTruman Show\u201d -level cleanliness on the streets.

REM is the sleep stage during which breathing becomes more rapid and irregular, eyes jerk violently, heart rate increases and blood pressure rises. When people wake up during the REM phase of sleep, they often describe dreams.\nWe also dream in other sleep phases, says Veronica Tonay, author, college instructor and psychologist in Santa Cruz, Calif.\nIf you sleep eight hours, 20 percent of your sleep will be spent in dreaming. Dreams start short: Your first dream will last about 10 minutes, Garfield says. They get increasingly longer as your sleep progresses. If you sleep for eight hours, your last dream - the one you'll remember - lasts 35 to 40 minutes. If you sleep less, you'll recall less, she adds.\nPeople dream more during certain periods of their lives, Garfield says. Increased dreaming occurs during adolescence. Teenagers sleep more and are experiencing hormonal changes. Pregnant women, undergoing hormonal changes and having psychological concerns - wondering what kind of mom they will be - have more dreams, Garfield says.\nPeople also tend to dream more when they are learning something new. \"Dreaming helps with the memory process,\" Garfield says.\nAs people age and get less sleep, dreaming decreases, Garfield says.\nThere are many who believe they do. Dreams can be the source of profound inspiration, Garfield says.\n\"It's very difficult to impose one meaning on a dream,\" says Tonay, who has kept a dream journal for 25 years.\nShe counts on her dreams to help her know when her life is out of balance.\nShe has a place she loves to visit in England. When she dreams about it, she takes it as a sign that she's too busy, that she's not taking care of herself. She doesn't have to book plane tickets, but she knows that she needs some self-nurturing - even just spending some time in her garden.\n\"Dreams are good touchstones for me,\" she says.\nIt's important to pay close attention to the feelings in dreams, Tonay says.\nThe bulk of dreaming is solving problems, Garfield says. Every new situation - first grade, a new school - all are strongly reflected in what we dream.\nBoth Garfield and Tonay say you can.\nLucid dreaming - when you are somewhere between wakefulness and dreaming - can be helpful for people who are having nightmares.

Is Trump franticallylooking for an escape route from the 17-year-old war that has been a complete disaster or he wants to inflict more misery on the poor, hapless, and war-weary Afghans?\nJust a few days ago, on an unannounced trip to Kabul, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration was prepared to \u201csupport, facilitate and participate\u201d in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.However, he hastened to add that the process will be Afghan-led.\nDid the position of U.S. on Afghan peace process change so dramatically in less than a week or was Nicholson simply not aware of it when his tongue apparently slipped? \u201cOur secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo, has said that we, the United States, are ready to talk to the Taliban and discuss the role of international forces,\u201d he said during a visit to southern province of Kandahar.\nTaliban, who refuse to recognize the legitimacy of government in Kabul, have always insisted on holding direct deliberations with Washington.

The group has repeatedly demanded lifting of travel embargo on Taliban leaders by UN and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. So will the U.S.-led coalition concede to the demand that foreign forces must withdraw from the battle-scarred country?\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has faced blistering criticism at home and abroad for failing to contain violence, has been desperately wooing the Taliban to join Afghan-led and Afghan-owned talks. A breakthrough was expected when the two parties observed an unprecedented three-day ceasefire on the festival of Eid this year. But, all hopes were dashed when the insurgent group refused to extend the ceasefire and went back to the frontlines of war.\nGhani, however, has not given up. On Monday, in an interview with RFE/RL, he dismissed the Taliban\u2019s rejection of his offer of peace talks, suggesting that the insurgent group can still be persuaded to come to the negotiating table. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you ask someone\u2019s hand in marriage and the family of the bride says no several times [before relenting],\u201d said the economist-turned-president, sounding clearly over-optimistic.

Each participant was given a total of eight minutes to share an opening argument, a rebuttal, and a two-minute closing argument.\nDebater argued in favor of preschool because, among other things, it can benefit the impoverished, set students up for success, and reduce crime rates. To make these arguments, Debater cited a broad range of sources, including National Institute for Early Education Research and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDebater\u2019s opening argument and rebuttal focused on the importance of doing what\u2019s considered morally right by humans. \u201cGiving opportunities to the less fortunate is a moral obligation of every human being,\u201d Debater said, after questioning whether her opponent (Debater is a female, its creators said) would rather have the poor on his doorstep.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basic human decency,\u201d Debater said in reference to welfare, calling it the same as extending a helping hand to someone who has fallen.\nFor his part, Natarajan argued that preschool subsidies could be spent better elsewhere in order to help the most disadvantaged and that such subsidies are principally a politically motivated handout for the middle class.\nDebater and Natarajan had never spoken prior to the debate.

I focus on one point of disagreement between the judges, which is whether a court, before holding that the state owes an investigative duty for the actions of private parties, would require the clearest statement in consistent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.\nIn particular, if Strasbourg jurisprudence is \u201cless than clear\u201d on this point, would the appropriate course be to allow the government to stick to the principles of the common law \u2013 in this case, no duty of care in tort \u2013 and wait until it is called before the Strasbourg judges to deploy its arguments?\nBut what in fact constitutes \u201cclear and constant jurisprudence\u201d? Some cases from Strasbourg suggest that the positive duty of the state under Article 3 (and Articles 2, 4 and 8) covers the actions of private parties. Other cases seem to confine the investigative duty to allegations against state agents only. Naturally the appellants in this case relied on the former, the respondents on the latter.\nthe sub-text to this argument appeared to be that, where Strasbourg has not yet spoken, national courts should not venture forth.\nThis argument has precedents in high places, such as Lord Brown in R (Al-Skeini) v Secretary of State for Defence  UKHL 26, and Lord Phillips in R (Smith) v Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner  UKSC 29 1 AC 1.\nThis is the so-called \u201cmirror principle\u201d, whereby pronouncements by national courts on Convention rights should match those of Strasbourg. It is, as Lord Kerr observes, often attributed to Lord Bingham\u2019s statement in Ullah where he said \u201cThe duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more but certainly no less\u201d (at para 20).\nDoes the mirror principle reflect the true nature of decision making in the higher courts?\nLord Kerr (with Lord Neuberger and Lady Hale) thinks not, citing a number of authorities, including Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust  UKSC 2. Here it was held that there was a positive obligation to protect the life of a mentally ill young woman who had been admitted to hospital informally because of serious attempts to take her own life. This decision was reached notwithstanding the fact that there was no authority from Strasbourg to that effect.\nThis seemed to Lord Kerr to be the correct approach.\nReticence by the courts of the UK to decide whether a Convention right has been violated would be an abnegation of our statutory obligation under section 6 of HRA. This section makes it unlawful for a public authority, including a court, to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\nLords Hughes and Mance (in the minority, albeit obiter as with this whole issue) did not agree.\nWhen combined with the open-ended nature of the positive obligation of the state to protect individual citizens against other individuals, this eagerness to compensate human rights infractions threatens to undermine the basis of tort law. And this has been wrought from the balancing, over decades, of citizens\u2019 rights versus resource allocation. Nor is this approach mandated by the Strasbourg Court, whose reliance on its own case law has contributed, they suggest, to the muddle we\u2019re now in.\nin none of these cases has the basis for,"}

But Mr. Craig also said President Obama intended to avoid any \u201cshoot from the hip\u201d and \u201cbumper sticker slogans\u201d approaches to deciding what to do with the counterterrorism policies he inherited.\nWithin days of his inauguration, Mr. Obama thrilled civil liberties groups when he issued executive orders promising less secrecy, restricting C.I.A. interrogators to Army Field Manual techniques, shuttering the agency\u2019s secret prisons, ordering the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, closed within a year and halting military commission trials.\nBut in more recent weeks, things have become murkier.\nDuring her confirmation hearing last week, Elena Kagan, the nominee for solicitor general, said that someone suspected of helping finance Al Qaeda should be subject to battlefield law \u2014 indefinite detention without a trial \u2014 even if he were captured in a place like the Philippines rather than in a physical battle zone.\nMs. Kagan\u2019s support for an elastic interpretation of the \u201cbattlefield\u201d amplified remarks that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. made at his own confirmation hearing. And it dovetailed with a core Bush position. Civil liberties groups argue that people captured away from combat zones should go to prison only after trials.\nTo be sure, Mr. Panetta emphasized that the president could not bypass antitorture statutes, as Bush lawyers claimed. And he said that waterboarding \u2014 a technique that induces the sensation of drowning, and that the Bush administration said was lawful \u2014 is torture.\nBut Mr. Panetta also said the C.I.A. might continue its \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d program, under which agents seize terrorism suspects and take them to other countries without extradition proceedings, in a more sweeping form than anticipated.\nBefore the Bush administration, the program primarily involved taking indicted suspects to their native countries for legal proceedings. While some detainees in the 1990s were allegedly abused after transfer, under Mr. Bush the program expanded and included transfers to third countries \u2014 some of which allegedly used torture \u2014 for interrogation, not trials.\nMr. Panetta said the agency is likely to continue to transfer detainees to third countries and would rely on diplomatic assurances of good treatment \u2014 the same safeguard the Bush administration used, and that critics say is ineffective.\nCivil liberties groups praise Mr. Obama"}

In many cases we need to deliver even better services, policies, and experiences,\" the strategy explains.\nThe strategy is centred on three main priorities: Government that's easy to deal with, which includes offering personalised and integrated services such as through the government-wide adoption of myGovID; government that's informed by citizens, especially in relation to the use of citizen data; and government that's fit for the digital age, which includes expanding digital capability, developing modern infrastructure, and providing accountability.\nAccompanying the strategy is a roadmap that breaks down the priorities into over 100 milestones, colour-coded against the three priorities, and organised into years from 2018 through 2020.\nA handful of initiatives have already been classed as completed, including the analysis of blockchain, creating a digital service standard, opening up government data, and overhauling the myGov inbox function.\nAmong the 33 items ticked off the to-do list so far, is the federal government's contentious My Health Record, which the DTA has marked as having one of two elements being complete due to it being available online.\nWhere My Health Record is concerned, the government in the coming year will move to add myGovID functionality to the online medical file.\nOne of the last features to come online will be the once every five years Australia-wide Census data collection activity, which will allow citizens to access the eCensus on all devices at least 48 hours prior to Census night.\nGuiding the strategy and the roadmap are five principles: Putting people's needs at the centre of policy and service design; proving trustworthiness; partnering to deliver value; continuously exploring and implementing innovation; and delivering value for money.\n\"Part of the reason for releasing a seven-year strategy is to share our vision and give the public time to consider the changes we are planning well in advance,\" Keenan said.\n\"We want to be able to talk about our future and address any questions or concerns early, so when people are ready, we can get on with the business of making life easier for everyone.\"\n\"This is vitally important because the rollout of digital services will only be successful if users have confidence in them.

Then a flute of lightly chilled, sparkling red wine was pressed into my hand, I took a sip, and realised it wasn't the meat I could smell at all - it was the wine. Now, maybe \"tastes of dead pig\" isn't the most tempting tasting note you've ever heard, but as with a red (an unfiltered, unfined grolleau called Le Cousin Rouge made using natural yeasts) I once gave friends who squealed that it \"smelled of chicken liver\", then decided, once they started eating, that \"the chicken liver wine\" was by far the nicest on the table, the mucky savagery of this \"wild boar wine\" was heavenly in the right place.

We poured some into a simple risotto made with onions, chicken stock, parmesan and loads of butter. \"The flavours coming off this are extraordinary,\" cried the cook as she stirred. The risotto was, too. If we'd used a more commercial, fruity wine, it would just have tasted of soapy alcohol and a little vacant.\nWine is all about context. In the past few weeks, I've drunk two other wines that, while not feral like this, tasted surprisingly different once put with the right food. One was Cono Sur Reserva Chardonnay 2007 (\u00a35.99, down from \u00a37.99 until 12 May, Waitrose; 13.5% abv), a sumptuous, rich, textured Chilean white that feels like opening a blind at midday in July and getting a faceful of hot sunshine while eating a slice of buttered toast. It's good, but for my taste far too much of a mouthful to have without food. We drank a glass each as part of an epic dinner cooked by my brother to celebrate him getting his commercial pilot's licence, and it was just right with chilli-spiked butternut squash soup so thick you could almost eat it with a fork and topped with slices of toast on to which he'd melted some gruy\u00e8re.\nThe other wine was a Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 so pale it seemed like a ghost.

This season's penultimate episode drew almost 9 million viewers and a series high in the coveted 18-49 demographic; needless to say, Twitter went wild.\nThe show is a new-media phenomenon, a flag bearer for Direct Courtship TV. Without Twitter to boost its profile and then its ratings, \"Scandal\" probably would have been canceled. Instead, it's held up as an example of social media prowess by networks and branding experts of every stripe, and its success further stokes the belief that somehow Twitter can save us all.\nAnyone producing \"original content\" (including this story) has their hopes pinned on social media. \"Follow me on Twitter\" has become a standard sign-off on business cards and correspondence, and an industry of social media consultants now offer advice to institutions that once shuddered at the word \"publicity.\"\nTheaters, where cellphone tones have been known to spark onstage meltdowns, now have designated \"tweet seats\" to encourage live commentary during performances.

Garland has been booed off stage and physically threatened, and he has received anonymous hate mail. In spite of this, he simply views the backlash as a part of the job.\n\u201cIf you meet a comedian saying they haven\u2019t bombed, they\u2019re lying to you,\u201d Garland said.\nEvery day, he said, he usually expects a diverse audience from all over the globe.\nEven with that, he said, he is mostly proud of being in the business for so long.\nAs far as advice for aspiring comedians, Garland urges rookies to get over their initial stage fright.\nAside from breaking into the scene, Garland stressed the importance of making smart business decisions.\nDespite everything, he is extremely satisfied with the career path he followed."}

Evans was not married. His mother, Missy Evans, pleaded with a Travis County probate judge because, she said, her 21-year-old son once said he wanted children. Three sons, in fact.\nWell, plenty of us would like to keep getting money from the tooth fairy, but real life typically intervenes when we grow up. Nikolas, 21, was punched in a street fight in Austin on March 27 and fell to the ground, striking his head. He died April 5. His death is a shame, but it's also a fact. Collecting his sperm won't bring him back, but it opens up a Pandora's box of ethical and practical questions.\nSomehow Missy Evans convinced the judge to order the county Medical Examiner's Office to keep Nikolas' body properly chilled and to allow an expert to remove the sperm, then found a urologist to collect it. She's been told much of the sperm is viable.\nSo ... the prospective father is dead. Who knows whether, even given his wish one day to be a parent, he would authorize his mother to create a child of his, to be born after he's dead? Who will be the \"mother\"? Would Nikolas approve of his mother's choice? What rights would the biological mother have? Would she and her \"mother-in-law\" see eye to eye on prenatal care during the pregnancy? On child-rearing? Most important, what would this innocent child think when old enough to learn of his or her origins?\nWith all respect and sympathy for Missy Evans, this appears to be a classic case of attempting to replace a lost child.

And the advancement of Kelsey, who currently serves as TriMet's chief operating officer, makes it difficult to judge if the pool of candidates was as strong as TriMet officials claim.\nThe job is changing hands at a crucial time in the agency's history. Security remains a prime focus since the May 26 knife attack that left two men dead and another injured aboard a MAX train. Voters, meanwhile, will likely be asked to decide on a transportation funding measure in 2020 that includes hundreds of millions of dollars for the Southwest Corridor light-rail project, which would connect downtown Portland with Tigard.\nAmong the letter's signatories are Metro Councilor Kathryn Harrington, who represents much of Washington County on the regional government council; Portland Commissioner Chole Eudaly; and David Douglas School District board member Ana del Rocio.\nLeaders of such community groups as Unite Oregon, the Oregon League of Conservation Voters and the Safe Routes to School National Partnership also signed on.\nTriMet began its GM search late last year, after McFarlane announced on Oct. 18 his intention to retire. McFarlane has said previously that he would remain in the post until a successor is named.\nThe agency hired a recruiting firm, KL2 Connects, which narrowed a field of 36 applicants to seven candidates, among them four white men, two black women and one black man.\nTriMet said from the start that it would withhold the names until it was down to a single finalist, to allow candidates to apply without risking their current employment. The board chose to interview three: Kelsey, another white man and a black woman. It identified Kelsey as the finalist on Jan. 17.\n\"I'm perturbed by the emphasis on confidentiality,\" said Vivian Satterfield, OPAL's deputy director. \"It's nothing personal against Doug Kelsey. But from start to finish, we had not only a confidential process but also a very, very condensed timeline.\"\nThe letter from OPAL questioned whether any women or candidates of color were interviewed -- details not released by TriMet until Wednesday.\nIn any case, Satterfield said, the two weeks between the time Kelsey was named the finalist and the board's vote next week wouldn't be enough time to reflect on the public's expectations.\nHarrington, a Metro councilor at the time McFarlane was hired as general manager, said the process seemed to suggest the result was determined before the public could weigh in.\n\"We know in the 21st century that we as public agencies have to do a better job of advancing racial equity and inclusion, and I'm"}
{"idx": "18155", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In continuous improvement environments, production management is practiced at all levels.\n2 What Are Management Techniques?\nIf your business is built around the creation of a product, managing the manufacture of that item dictates the degree of success your business enjoys. Understanding a variety of production management techniques gives you a toolbox for approaching bottlenecks and improvements. Even if you run a small business, understanding methodologies used by major manufacturers may benefit your company.\nProduction management covers the planning and implementation of the entire production process, from the order of raw materials to delivery to the client. Any decisions you make for your business within these bounds is an element of production management. As a small business owner, you focus on problem-solving, efficiency of production and quality of products. Production management systems abound. Most businesses build around one system while drawing on elements of others, creating a custom blend that suits their market and clients.\nA given quantity of finished goods requires a given quantity of raw materials and components to make them. Materials requirement planning systems are computerized tools that manage when materials must be ordered to supply production at a later date. MRP is effective when output quantities are known. Small business owners are often their own MRP systems, storing the information needed to supply production in their knowledge and experience. Activities such as computer tracking inventory and forecasting demand are MRP activities.\nJust-in-time, or lean manufacturing, is a production management philosophy built around the continuous reduction of waste. It is suited for businesses where production efficiency is key. Anything that interferes with productivity is waste and, therefore, the enemy under JIT systems. Techniques that support JIT philosophy include reducing inbound inventory by creating supplier delivery schedules, minimizing outbound stock with customer delivery schedules and constant work in-house reducing scrap material and wasted man-hours. These techniques improve cash flow and maximize sales margins.\nFlow control, also called optimized production technology, focuses on the efficient flow of material through the production process. The philosophy of flow control focuses on bottlenecks. For example, an owner using flow control will not buy a machine capable of 1,000 units an hour if supply is only 500 units. Examine systems and determine where lowest flow is experienced, then address that point and make sure it operates at full capacity. Flow control applies well where maximum productivity is required.\nShpak, Scott. \"Production Management Techniques.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/production-management-techniques-45200.html.

But once Day 1 of the draft passes, Dallas will look next to the second and third rounds to fill gaps.\nThis is the latest post in NFL draft expert Dane Brugler's \"Plan B\" series spotlighting second- and third-round players the Cowboys should keep on their radar.\nAssuming Anthony Hitchens departs in free agency, the linebacker position is arguably the top need for the Cowboys this offseason. Sean Lee and Jaylon Smith are penciled in as the starters, but both have durability concerns and the depth of the position needs a boost. There will be several linebacker options on Day 2 of this year's draft, including Boise State's Leighton Vander Esch. Dallas hasn't been shy about plucking defensive talent out of Boise, including former draft picks and current Cowboys DeMarcus Lawrence, Tyrone Crawford and Orlando Scandrick.\nLateral range to mirror and pursuit speed to close. Plant-and-drive quickness to unlock and go. High football intelligence. Backfield vision and toughness to scrape down the line and find the correct gap. Functional strength to find work in the trenches. Gets skinny through gaps with budding skills as a blitzer. Coordinated feet to control his movements in coverage. Effective in his zone drops, using his eyes to feel routes and find passing lanes. Strikes with pop in his pads, tackling low and bringing his legs with him. Motor doesn't quit and defends both sidelines. Workable body type with length, adding 40-plus pounds since he arrived in Boise. Team captain with impressive character on and off the field. Self-starter and quickly proved his worth as a walk-on, earning a scholarship during his redshirt season (Boise State head coach Bryan Harsin: \"He's not lucky, he's a hard worker.\"). Highly productive 2017 season, ranking fifth in the FBS with 141 tackles.\nNeeds to calm his feet to face the ballcarrier up and make open-field stops. Stiffness shows when he attempts to quickly redirect, over-running ballcarriers. Long arms, but immature take-on skills. More of a battering ram at the point of attack and needs to develop his hand technique. Slowed by road blocks mid-pursuit. Inconsistent results as an edge-setter. Late bloomer physically and still adjusting to the transformation. Only one season as a starter. Durability will be questioned after an injury-riddled 2016 campaign, missing seven games.\nA one-year starter at Boise State, Vander Esch had a breakthrough 2017 season as the WILL linebacker in the Broncos' hybrid 3-3-5 scheme, becoming the first player in school history to win Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year honors. He was a big fish in a small pond in high school (played quarterback/linebacker in eight-man high school football) and needed time to fill out his frame and adjust to major college football when he arrived in Boise, blossoming as a junior.\nVander Esch competes with the athleticism, instincts and toughness that translate well to the NFL level, making plays vs. the run and in coverage. He finds himself out of control at times, leading to finishing issues, and needs to properly use his length when taking on blocks, but his flaws can be improved with more reps. Overall"}

Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to meetings at the White House. Afterward, Obama set a hard deadline for reaching an agreement, saying he wanted a deal from the congressional leadership overnight.\n\"I expect an answer in the morning,\" Obama said, emerging from a late session at the White House. \"My hope is that I'll be able to announce to the American people, sometime relatively early in the day, that a shutdown has been averted.\"\nUnderscoring the stakes involved, Obama canceled plans to visit Indiana on Friday so he could remain in Washington and oversee the talks.\nIf the two sides near an agreement, another short-term measure could be instituted to allow the deal to be adopted.\nMeanwhile, the government continued preparations to halt government operations. In Baghdad, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told troops that they may not receive their next paychecks because of the shutdown.\nFor weeks, Republicans have insisted on reductions in federal spending. Conservative House members also have pushed for Republican policy priorities only indirectly related to the spending debate.\n\"This debate used to be about saving money,\" Reid said earlier in the day. \"That is no longer the case. The 'tea party' is trying to push through its extreme social agenda -- issues that have nothing to do with funding the government.\"\nThe two sides appeared to be near agreement on a package that would cut spending by $34.5 billion from domestic programs for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.\nThe new package would cut slightly deeper than a previous proposal, in part because it would include $3 billion in reductions to the Defense Department that would appeal to Democrats as well as fiscally conservative Republicans. It represents about half of the $61 billion in cuts the GOP has sought.\nBut Boehner insisted that no new agreement on spending levels had been reached as he continued to pursue the largest package of cuts possible.\nPolls show that most in Boehner's party are behind him. In a new Gallup poll, most respondents wanted the two sides to compromise, and a slight majority of Republicans wanted lawmakers to stick to their principles, even if it means shutting down the government.\nConservative activists have urged the GOP to hold out for more cuts, staging rallies and calling for a government shutdown.\n\"We're continuing to work toward an agreement,\" Boehner said after a midday meeting at the White House with Reid and Vice President Joe Biden. \"But we are not there yet.\"\nYet the dispute over the size of the spending cuts receded as Republicans made a play to include their top policy priorities, which have been a strong undercurrent throughout the debate, in the budget package.\nBoehner is fighting to retain provisions that were included in House-passed bill in February. Those provisions would restrict abortion services and limit the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollutants.\nTo many rank-and-file Republicans, those hot-button issues are just as important as spending cuts.

He said he was prepared to negotiate with the prime minister, but if no power-sharing deal was reached, he could invade the capital.\nTwo weeks later, on April 4, he sent troops from his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) streaming towards Tripoli - just at a time when U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the city to prepare for a national reconciliation conference this month which Guterres\u2019 aides thought Haftar supported.\nFor world powers including France, Italy and Britain, the general\u2019s military campaign, the biggest in Libya since the 2011 uprising that deposed Gaddafi, represented a major setback.\nThey had tried for years to co-opt Haftar, 75, into a political settlement that would stabilize the major oil and gas producer after almost a decade of conflict that had acted as a breeding ground for Islamist militancy.\nEven the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which have backed Haftar and see him as a bulwark against Islamists in north Africa, appear to have been surprised by his rapid advance. A French diplomatic source said Paris, which has also aided the general, had no prior warning of the offensive.\nThe diplomats\u2019 calls for military restraint in the meeting last month had echoed those from other Western and U.N. envoys who had traveled to Haftar\u2019s base outside the city of Benghazi in the preceding weeks, four separate diplomatic sources said.\nIn a sign of how far the situation in Libya - and Haftar - was beyond their control, U.N. and Western envoys in daily contact with his camp about the conference had no idea he was about to launch the offensive, the four diplomatic sources said.\nSome even thought the general was bluffing.\n\u201cThese are just psycho games,\u201d one U.N. official texted Reuters when the first LNA troops were spotted south of Tripoli.\nSome diplomats who had met Haftar many times and lobbied their governments to overlook his hardline comments - such as that Libya was not ready for democracy - despaired when it became clear he was committed to taking the city by force.\nHaftar, for his part, has been consistent in speeches and statements about his commitment to military force in his declared mission to restore order to the north African country and also dropped hints about ultimately ruling the country.\nWhen he first announced his intentions in February 2014 he stood in front of a map of Libya, a somber-looking, gray-haired man wearing an immaculate army uniform, and vowed to stage a coup.\nWestern countries left Libya after fighting in Tripoli in 2014, closing embassies and ending NATO training programs, before returning in 2016.\nTheir period of absence opened the door for Arab countries such as Egypt and the UAE"}

Ultimately, Josh Brolin won the role of Thanos and did a memorable job embodying the character Starlin originally created for Marvel Comics back in 1973.\nThanos\u2019 status as one of the biggest bad guys in the Marvel Comics universe made him a slam-dunk to eventually appear in the MCU. And, while Thanos did make some brief cameo appearances in MCU films, it wasn\u2019t until this year\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War that he emerged as a full-fledged villain. Though Brolin\u2019s Thanos was certainly a terrifying threat in the film, many in the audience came to feel sympathy for him, and the movie left the character in an interesting place as a set-up for next year\u2019s Avengers 4.\nStarlin does say that after seeing Brolin play Thanos via the latest in performance-capture technology, he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine anybody else playing that character.\u201d Starlin also says that Brolin\u2019s voice has changed the way he hears Thanos in the comics. \u201cMy hearing of it, it\u2019s a lot less gravelly than I had expected it in the past to be,\u201d he explained. Though Thanos is a larger-than-life character and immensely powerful, Brolin\u2019s performance is a lot quieter and more elegant than many might have expected. Elba certainly could have brought a similar quality to the character, but it's hard to see Schwarzenegger finding the same combination of traits.\nIndeed, the shadings Brolin brought to the character in Avengers: Infinity War took Thanos beyond his origins as a somewhat cheesy comic book character and turned him into a fully fleshed-out being capable of experiencing deep emotions. Of course, those emotions did not stop Thanos from doing many unspeakably horrific things in the name of his plan to save the universe. The ramifications of that plan and its successful completion will lead to even more carnage when Thanos returns in Avengers 4 to square off against the handful of heroes who are still left after the snap. Everyone has their theory about how the Avengers will finally defeat Thanos, but unless Mark Ruffalo spills the beans early, fans won't get to find out who's right until 2019."}

Allows for super-organized channel management.\nLooks exactly like Slack. Can only be used as part of Office 365.\nMicrosoft Teams is an excellent collaboration service, with the large caveat that it's only available to Office 365 users.\nUndoubtedly attracted by all the success other companies have been having in the online collaboration space, Microsoft designed its Teams app to let virtual groups combine their efforts across applications, files, and meetings. For $5 per user per month, Microsoft goes to great pains to take the best aspects of Slack and essentially build them into Office 365 using Teams as the wedge. Not only does this integration give it a leg up from a feature perspective, Microsoft's large array of value-add partners and third-party Office 365 add-on apps give it even more power.\nFor those of you who've never used a chat app at work, here's a small primer: Programs like Slack, HipChat, Workplace by Facebook, and now Teams provide you with a corporate-wide workspace in which your teams can have conversations as large groups or in smaller, private groups. Want to discuss marketing strategy? Create a private marketing chat room. Want to discuss the National Basketball Association? Create a private sports chat room. Want to send a message to the entire company? Send the message in the General channel.\nAs chat apps have evolved, they've enabled companies to include video conferencing tools, embedded video via YouTube, GIFs via Giphy, file sharing, and storage. Microsoft Teams can do all this in a cohesive and embedded manner by connecting Redmond's large ecosystem of business apps to the Teams interface on a desktop, or via a mobile app across Android, iOS, and Windows phones. Take a look at our deeper dive into the Microsoft Teams iOS app for a sense of how the simply designed mobile experience handles channel-based collaboration, calling, chat, and alerts.\nAs of July 2018, Microsoft has brought Teams even closer to its arch-nemisis, Slack, by giving it the one thing Slack's always had that Microsoft tends to forget: A free version that's actually worth the download, at least for smaller businesses. That's because the free tier has a limit of 300 users. By contrast, Slack has no such limitation, but then again, 300 users will certainly cover most small businesses employee rosters. The Teams free tier also has no message limit, meaning that even companies using the free version can rely on Teams to let them search their entire message history with no worries concerning eventual deletion due to message cap. Though, while there's no message cap, there are storage limits, but even these are fairly lenient with 10GB as a base and another 2GB per user. Finally, Teams even adds the niceties for free users, including user-to-user voice calls as well as group voice sessions, too. You can even leverage not only Teams' Office 365 integration, but any third-party app integrations you want to built yourself. That's a lot of muscle for a free app, and it should Microsoft well in its ongoing Slack war.\nWhen you first open Teams, you see a left-hand rail that includes the Activity, Chat, Teams, Meetings, and Files tabs.

So where\u2019s the happy medium? According to Emilio, textured hair can still be cleansed on a weekly basis.\nAt the same time, your curl pattern and texture also play a big part in determining how often you cleanse. The tighter your curl, the dryer your hair may be, so those with kinkier strands definitely shouldn\u2019t be cleansed more than once a week. (And hydration in between is always helpful.). But for finer hair, \u201cyou can cleanse more in order to remove oil from the scalp, but I recommend no more than twice a week,\u201d says Emilio.\n\u201cIf you know you went multiple days in between washing, putting your pre-poo on before cleansing your hair can help detangle, and it\u2019s also a great way to help the water penetrate faster into your hair, making your wash day much easier and even a little faster,\u201d she says.\nExtra conditioner\u2014before or after cleansing\u2014is always a good thing, too. \u201cIf your reasoning for adding condition before you cleanse is because you\u2019re feeling too tangled up, then sure go ahead.

One need only look at photos of the two seated in the front row at the White House announcement of Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court to grasp how insufficiently that separates the president from his business interests.\nThe undisclosed foreign financial entanglements of Trump\u2019s children elevate the security implications. Before now, there\u2019s been very little dispute that foreign money could pose a threat: The implications of overseas investments are so critical that there is an interagency committee tasked with reviewing the national security risks of transactions that could render control of a U.S. business to a foreign person. The potential compromises of foreign business relationships run both ways, and the Trumps\u2019 myriad foreign financial relationships creates the risk that in matters of national security and foreign policy, their choices will be guided by what is best for their bank accounts, not the United States.\nBut Ivanka Trump\u2019s new West Wing post doesn\u2019t only bring more financial conflicts of interest into the White House; because she\u2019s the president\u2019s daughter, it also makes them worse. The inherently compromising loyalty of family relationships and the necessity of genuine expertise in senior government roles are why federal law prohibits nepotism \u2014 and why that law explicitly applies to the president. Trump appeared to recognize this when he repeatedly reassured the public that his children would not have any role in the government.\nIn the 50 years since enactment of the anti-nepotism law, presidents have generally avoided testing its limits. The day after Trump was sworn in, however, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) determined that the statute does not apply to the president\u2019s hiring of White House staff. This was an affirmative change of the office\u2019s past analysis. In 1972, OLC determined that the law did apply to White House staff and would prevent President Richard Nixon from appointing a relative. A 1977 opinion likewise concluded that President Jimmy Carter could not legally appoint his son to an unpaid position in the White House.\nThe about-face of the January opinion may be legally defensible; it rests on a conflicting statute that grants broad presidential authority to staff the White House \u201cwithout regard to any other provision of law.\u201d But the issue here isn\u2019t one of legal technicalities.

He started a record label in New York \u2014 Blue Note, he called it \u2014 and signed mainly African-American musicians, most of whom had music and little opportunity elsewhere, no fallback plan, no safety net. A thoroughly American story, in other words.\nThe first recording was a boogie-woogie number \u2014 light in the darkest of days \u2014 by not one, but two pianists, Albert Ammons and Meade \"Lux\" Lewis, a session rousingly re-created last month at New York's Town Hall by two young Blue Note talents, Robert Glasper and Jason Moran, both friends of hip-hop and pop. They wore tuxedos with limited-edition Blue Note Adidas shell tops, and seamlessly transitioned into recent work by Glasper, who routinely packs 25-year-olds into venues like the Highline Ballroom (for anyone who may think of Blue Note, or jazz, as sepia-toned).\nThe Town Hall concert was just the beginning of a year-long celebration that includes the Portland Jazz Festival currently underway; an exhibit at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles opening in March; a Moran performance at the Kennedy Center in May; an autobiography from Bruce Lundvall, who revived the label in the 1980s; a book from Thames & Hudson in the fall; and all sorts of releases, both reissues of some of the classic titles on vinyl and new ones by many in the label's impressive roster, including Ambrose Akinmusire, Joe Lovano/Dave Douglas, Bobby Hutcherson, and Wayne Shorter, whose excellent release last year, Without a Net, expresses the ethos of Blue Note and jazz itself.\nMoran and Glasper, signed in 1998 and 2005 respectively, both talked at Town Hall about how they were told by Lundvall \u2014 in the spirit of Alfred Lion \u2014 to make the music they wanted. \"You make the music, we'll sell it,\" Glasper said of Lundvall. What more lilting words could a creative soul hear?\nOther labels have done a great service to jazz, but Blue Note, through its staying power and willingness to take risk, has reflected the diversity within jazz: hot, cool, swing, bop, hard bop, free, fusion, to the eclecticism of today, like Roseanne Cash, Al Green, Norah Jones, the superlative Brazilian mega-star Marisa Monte, and Jos\u00e9 James. You wonder, if the nimbleAlfred Lion \u2014 informed by a life in which risk was a necessity \u2014 didn't document this music, would anyone else have? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe some of it, maybe not in the same way. We'll never know. And anyway, he did, thankfully.\nFunny thing about Lion: He's never been celebrated as a superhero of race relations, maybe because he didn't pound his chest the way so many in the arts and politics did during the Civil Rights Movement. Lion loved the music, especially the pre-war music. He even \u2014 and this was a Blue Note thing \u2014 paid musicians to rehearse. He wasn't a \"do-gooder,\" but he done good.\nThe label's greatest period was the mid-1950s through the late-1960s \u2014 Lion sold off the label in 1967 because of health issues \u2014 as the world began to roil"}

Without delay, officials at the Ministry of the Interior and Directorate-General of Personnel Administration soon gave several reasons to support Jiang\u2019s stance.\nThe government\u2019s response was expected when New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu\u2019s (\u6731\u7acb\u502b) criticism that the six-day Lunar New Year holiday this year was relatively short appeared to resonate with the public and prompted lawmakers to vie to make nine-day Lunar New Year holidays mandatory.\nLeaving aside immediate opposition from leaders of business groups, who tend to bemoan the effects public holidays have on productivity and production, any increase in public holidays is attractive to most constituencies, which is why Jiang tried to get a step ahead of lawmakers by declaring his support for the issue with his three proposals.\nThe problem of long work hours alone no doubt deserves government attention more than the number of public holidays, especially for people who are not covered under regulations passed in 2001 mandating a five-day workweek, which apply to civil public servants, military personnel and teachers.\nAccording to a report released by the then-Council of Labor Affairs, now the Ministry of Labor, in December last year, Taiwanese in 2012 worked an average of 2,141 hours, which was the third-highest annual average among 30 countries. The study did not include Hong Kong, which is also known for its extremely long working hours. Taiwan followed Mexico and Singapore, where people averaged 2,402 hours and 2,226 hours that year, respectively.\nTaiwan\u2019s average is much longer than the average of 72 countries \u2014 1,915 hours per year \u2014 surveyed by UBS, a global financial service firm, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) average of 1,776 hours.\nTaiwan is among the few Asian countries lacking a mandatory five-day workweek across all sectors, as set out in the \u201cForty-Hour Week Convention\u201d adopted by the International Labor Organization in 1935.\nThe Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has found that about 90 percent of employees worked more than 40 hours a week in 2012 and about 10 percent worked more than 50 hours a week that year.\nAlong with the 2001 implementation of the five-day workweek in certain sectors, the then-revised Labor Standards Act (\u52de\u52d5\u57fa\u6e96\u6cd5) reduced regular work hours to 84 hours every two weeks, compared with the original 48 hours a week provision.\nWhat does \u201ca little happiness in hand\u201d mean?\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have this kind of a little happiness, life would be like a dry, arid desert,\u201d Murakami said."}

By monitoring someone's brain activity, the technology can reconstruct the words a person hears with unprecedented clarity. It also lays the groundwork for helping people who cannot speak, such as those living with as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or recovering from stroke, regain their ability to communicate with the outside world.\nThese findings were published today in Scientific Reports.\n\"Our voices help connect us to our friends, family and the world around us, which is why losing the power of one's voice due to injury or disease is so devastating,\" said Nima Mesgarani, PhD, the paper's senior author and a principal investigator at Columbia University's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. \"With today's study, we have a potential way to restore that power. We've shown that, with the right technology, these people's thoughts could be decoded and understood by any listener.\"\nDecades of research has shown that when people speak -- or even imagine speaking -- telltale patterns of activity appear in their brain. Distinct (but recognizable) pattern of signals also emerge when we listen to someone speak, or imagine listening. Experts, trying to record and decode these patterns, see a future in which thoughts need not remain hidden inside the brain -- but instead could be translated into verbal speech at will.\nBut because this approach has failed to produce anything resembling intelligible speech, Dr. Mesgarani's team turned instead to a vocoder, a computer algorithm that can synthesize speech after being trained on recordings of people talking.\n\"This is the same technology used by Amazon Echo and Apple Siri to give verbal responses to our questions,\" said Dr. Mesgarani, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nTo teach the vocoder to interpret to brain activity, Dr. Mesgarani teamed up with Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon at Northwell Health Physician Partners Neuroscience Institute and co-author of today's paper. Dr. Mehta treats epilepsy patients, some of whom must undergo regular surgeries.\n\"Working with Dr. Mehta, we asked epilepsy patients already undergoing brain surgery to listen to sentences spoken by different people, while we measured patterns of brain activity,\" said Dr. Mesgarani. \"These neural patterns trained the vocoder.\"\n\"We found that people could understand and repeat the sounds about 75% of the time, which is well above and beyond any previous attempts,\" said Dr. Mesgarani. The improvement in intelligibility was especially evident when comparing the new recordings to the earlier, spectrogram-based attempts. \"The sensitive vocoder and powerful neural networks represented the sounds the patients had originally listened to with surprising accuracy.\"\nDr. Mesgarani and his team plan to test more complicated words and sentences next, and they want to run the same tests on brain signals emitted when a person speaks or imagines speaking. Ultimately, they hope their system could be part of an implant, similar to those worn by some epilepsy patients, that translates the wearer's thoughts directly into words.\n\"In this scenario, if the wearer thinks 'I need a glass of water,' our system could take the brain signals generated by that thought, and turn them into synthesized, verbal speech,\" said Dr. Mesgarani. \"This would be a game changer.

Many Americans associate Islam with figures such as Osama bin Laden, and they worry about \u201chomegrown terrorists.\u201d To shed light on this increasingly important religious group and counter mutual distrust, renowned scholar Akbar Ahmed conducted the most comprehensive study to date of the American Muslim community.\nJourney into America explores and documents how Muslims are fitting into U.S. society, placing their experience within the larger context of American identity. This eye-opening book also offers a fresh and insightful perspective on American history and society. Following up on his critically acclaimed Journey into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization (Brookings, 2007), Ahmed and his team of young researchers traveled for a year through more than seventyfive cities across the United States\u2014from New York City to Salt Lake City; from Las Vegas to Miami; from the large Muslim enclave in Dearborn, Michigan, to small, predominantly white towns like Arab, Alabama. They visited homes, schools, and over one hundred mosques to discover what Muslims are thinking and how they are living every day in America.\nIn this unprecedented exploration of American Muslim communities, Ahmed asked challenging questions: Can we expect an increase in homegrown terrorism? How do American Muslims ofArab descent differ from those of other origins (for example, Somalia or South Asia)? Why are so many white women converting to Islam? How can a Muslim become accepted fully as an \u201cAmerican,\u201d and what does that mean? He also delves into the potentially sticky area of relations with other religions. For example, is there truly a deep divide between Muslims and Jews in America? And how well do Muslims get along with other religious groups, such as Mormons in Utah?\nJourney into America is equal parts anthropological research, listening tour, and travelogue. Whereas Ahmed\u2019s previous book took the reader into homes, schools, and mosques in the Muslim world, his new quest takes us into the heart of America and its Muslim communities.

I believe it is right that I take responsibility for what has happened.\n\"It is a matter of the greatest possible sadness to me that a programme on my network has been the cause of such a controversy.\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to offer my personal apology to Andrew Sachs and his family and to the audience for what has happened.\"\nA statement released by BBC management said: \"The presenter Jonathan Ross will be suspended from all broadcasting for the BBC for a 12-week period, ending in mid-January 2009.\n\"He will not be paid by the BBC during this period: the fees that would have been paid will be deducted from his BBC contract.\"\nThompson said: \"The ultimate editorial responsibility for BBC programmes lies with producers and editorial managers. The consequences of errors of judgement are therefore more serious for managers.\n\"Nonetheless, Jonathan Ross's contribution to this edition of the Russell Brand show was utterly unacceptable and cannot be allowed to go uncensured or without sanction.\n\"A 12-week suspension is an exceptional step, but I believe it is a proportionate response to Jonathan's role in this unhappy affair.\nDouglas said her decision to resign was \"my decision alone\". She will step down as controller of BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music and from her role as controller of popular music.\nShe added: \"It has been a huge privilege to have been entrusted with the leadership of the UK's most popular radio station, which is so intensely loved by the audience.\n\"I have also had the tremendous pleasure of launching BBC 6 Music and more recently of leading popular music output across the BBC.\n\"I know I leave BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music in the hands of a dedicated and passionate team of incredibly talented presenters and production staff.

{"idx": "18202", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: How much do you think having a good day is due to luck?\nFor some, the quest to have a good day can be akin to finding a four-leaf clover. Good days typically evade us, and when a cycle of bad days becomes a pattern it\u2019s common to think that we\u2019re down on our luck.\nA common symbol of good luck, a four-leaf clover represents many things, such as hope, wealth, love and health. However, unless it\u2019s given, finding a four-leaf clover requires purpose.\nThis micro skill of intentional kindness moves you from wishing you had a good day to creating a good day for yourself and others through intentional kindness.\nUsing the four-leaf clover as a framework, four areas of life can engage intentional kindness: self, personal life, professional life and public interactions. Kindness can be defined as a healthy action that provides a perceived benefit.\nSelf-kindness \u2013 enjoy some guilt-free downtime (for example, take 30 minutes to quietly eat lunch).\nPersonal life kindness \u2013 help a spouse or family member do a household chore.\nProfessional life kindness \u2013 bring one of your teammates a green tea without being asked.\nWe may not be able to find a four-leaf clover every day, but we can create goodwill for ourselves and others through one act of kindness in each of the four areas. Through self-awareness we can look for these kinds of opportunities each day.\nOur life success and happiness most likely do have some degree of luck. For example, showing up at the train station at 8:45 a.m. instead of your usual time of 9 a.m. could be the reason you meet a new person who ends up having a profound impact on your career and life.\nWishing for such moments can be disappointing. Life happens, and whatever luck we have is by chance and often unplanned. However, we can create our own luck by paying attention to what we do each day to help ourselves and others using intentional kindness.\nThis micro skill is based on motivation, willingness to suspend judgment and taking charge of our decisions and actions by performing at least one act of kindness in each of the four areas.\nMany of us have lists of things we think we need to do daily that makes it feel like it\u2019s hard to relax or slow down.\nIntentional kindness is one way to train our brain to be kind to ourselves and enjoy moments in a busy, hectic world. It\u2019s not about giving ourselves or others permission to self-medicate to feel better, to avoid responsibilities or as an excuse from responsibilities. It\u2019s all about being considerate, concerned and gentle to ourselves and others around us. If you\u2019re tired and struggling to keep up with the demands of the day, allow yourself to say you\u2019ve had enough and go to sleep. The benefit is to feel well rested and positioned for success to pick up the challenges tomorrow.\nIntentional kindness challenge: Make a commitment for four weeks to consciously look for at least one opportunity each day to perform an intentional act of kindness in each of the four kindness areas of self, personal, professional and public. At the end of each day, write out your acts of kindness and score your day on a scale of one to 10 on how good it was overall. At the end of the four weeks, compare your daily scores on the last week to those of the first.\nLuck versus living: Waiting for good things to happen that can change our life often results in regret. By paying attention to what we do intentionally each day we can improve our experience and opportunity for creating more good days than bad.

The Hells Angels set up a chapter in Auckland in early 1961.\nSince those early days other outlaw bikers have moved into New Zealand with the Bandidos (via Australia) arriving in 2012 and the Hawke's Bay-based Outlaws Motorcycle Club aligning to the US-based organisation of the same name in 2014.\nHowever, the establishment of international gangs has increased over the past seven years, with the Australian-based Rebels MC establishing chapters across New Zealand (from 2011) and the Comancheros, another Australian-based MC arriving in 2018.\nThe flow of outlaw bikers from Australia has arguably been influenced by the Australian Government's policy of deporting convicted felons with New Zealand citizenship back to New Zealand, in some cases deporting enough members of a particular gang for them to set up a chapter in a short time.\nThere is a long history of connections between gangs on either side of the Tasman and family connections have eased the takeover of some local New Zealand gangs by Australian gangs. But the flow of people, and gangs in particular, goes both ways.\nHighway 61 successfully set up chapters in Australia (1990s). The Mongrel Mob, after a failed attempt to establish a presence in Perth in the 1980s, have successfully set up chapters in Melbourne and Queensland with plans for similar moves into Adelaide. Black Power have a strong presence on Queensland's Gold Coast. Following the Mongrel Mob, they have also established a chapter in Melbourne.\nThese events show the fluidity in the movement of gang members and a strong connection between gangs in Australia and New Zealand. The connectivity also has implications for the gang map in New Zealand.\nWith the establishment of international outlaw bikers like the Bandidos MC and the Outlaw MC in Aotearoa New Zealand, the outlaw biker scene has changed considerably over the past five years. The Hells Angels and their close allies the Head Hunters (West Auckland) have embarked on the rapid takeover (called patching over) of local outlaw gangs.\nThe Head Hunters patched over the Wellington-based Sinn Fein MC in 2011, Satan's Slaves MC in 2014 and the Epitaph Riders of Christchurch. The Hells Angels patched over the Lost Breed from Nelson in 2016 and replaced the Palmerston North-based Mothers MC in 2018. They have also set up chapters in South Auckland and Christchurch.\nIn these actions there has been a clear move by the Hells Angels and the Head Hunters with a long history in New Zealand to take over large areas of both the North and South Island. This expansion is made more intriguing given the Hells Angels' limited expansion in the past. Also, in Blenheim, the Lone Legion patched over to the international Outlaws MC. Add to this mix the Rebels, the Bandidos, and the Comancheros.\nIt seems they have been more than aware of the move by Australian and international outlaw bikers to establish a presence, sometimes in areas they consider their turf, and it is not unexpected that these two groups would respond.\nRecently, it was reported that the Mongrel Mob and Black Power held a hui to discuss the issues of the outlaw bikers"}

That's what could happen if Brees' Saints can win three more games, including today's NFC divisional playoff with the 49ers, and claim their second Super Bowl title in three seasons.\nIf that happens, Brees could cement himself among the game's all-time greats. He's on the threshold already, having been a Super Bowl MVP, having eclipsed Dan Marino's 27-year-old single-season record with 5,476 yards \u2014 Brees' second 5,000-yard season \u2014 and having made a winner out of a franchise starved for relevance.\nWithout Brees, New Orleans probably isn't even in the playoffs. The same could be said for the Patriots if Tom Brady wasn't around. The Packers probably would be, if Matt Flynn was half as good as he looked in the regular-season finale.\nA nation gushed over the heart-warming picture of Brees lifting up his son Baylen amidst the cascading confetti after the Super Bowl. After the Saints' win over the Lions in the first round of the playoffs last weekend, making the rounds is that same shot, which has been photo-shopped with diminutive teammate Darren Sproles being held aloft by the quarterback.\nThere's little secret that Brees has carried this team to unprecedented heights.\nOne thing Brees does not do, however, is get ahead of himself. And not that he's in any hurry to retire after 11 seasons. He turned 33 on Friday, but has plenty left in the tank.\nBut it is true. He is improving.\n\"Drew has raised his play since 2009,\" his coach, Sean Payton, said after the Saints crushed the Lions with an NFL postseason-record 626 yards. \"No. 1, he's tough on himself. More than anything, he has improved in his pocket awareness with six years of running the same system, his command of what we're doing. You see his consistency week in and week out.\"\n\"He's never uptight,\" wideout Robert Meacham said. \"You see him come in the huddle with that swagger.\"\nAnd why not? A win today would put the Saints in their third NFC championship game in six years. Brees will try to extend his mark to 44 consecutive games with a touchdown pass. He's the only quarterback in league history to throw for more than 5,000 yards twice. His postseason quarterback rating of 106.2 ranks second in NFL history behind only Aaron Rodgers.\n\"He will be (in the conversation with) Joe Montana and John Elway,\" Saints cornerback Jabari Greer said. \"It'll be a couple of years before you see a Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers again. But Brees is the kind we'll talk about five or 10 years from now.\"\nThey're talking about him a lot right now.\nOn a recent New Orleans airport shuttle ride, the driver \u2014 an unabashed S"}

A committee with equal representation and voting power from each municipality is expected to make decisions on such issues as personnel, facilities and other management determinations.\nAccording to a draft budget and analysis for the joint court system, the eight municipalities lost an approximated total of $242,490 in 2010 due to court expenses far exceeding revenue.\nThe 2012 joint court loss for all eight municipalities combined is tentatively projected to be $60,799 \u2014 a potential loss reduction of more than $181,000.\n\u201cEvery municipality lost money in their courts last year. Hopefully with this new structure, that\u2019ll be decreased greatly,\u201d Daddario said.\nDaddario said the municipalities are hoping to add more sessions than currently held and reduce case processing time along the way.\n\u201cIt will all be located in one court so a judge is not running from court to court to hear cases, and all the record-keeping, everything, is in one location,\u201d he said.\nDeerfield Township Mayor John Stanzione said Wednesday that, while the joint court system seems to be a good way to save money, he remained concerned about the potential for jobs to be lost in a poor economic climate.\nHowever, Daddario pointed out that Hopewell\u2019s currently shared court system with Greenwich, Stow Creek and Shiloh houses only one employee, and it is not yet known if or how many jobs would be lost as part of the consolidation.\nFurthermore, Deerfield Township Committeeman Keith Lauermann pointed out that the municipalities would likely best serve their constituents\u2019 interests and retain individuality by setting up a shared system on their terms sooner rather than later.\nOrdinances formally establishing participation in the joint municipal court will be drafted and reviewed in coming weeks."}

During a heated exchange with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman that was later detailed in a Sports Illustrated article, Jeter asked Cashman which shortstops he would rather have.\nOne player Cashman listed: Troy Tulowitzki, who, nine years later, will indeed be patrolling shortstop for the Yankees on opening day.\nHe certainly was, but so much has happened since.\nJeter, of course, retired after the 2014 season, and is now a part owner and chief executive of the Miami Marlins. He was replaced at shortstop by Didi Gregorius, who has grown into a standout at the position.\nTulowitzki is not the same player he was in 2010, when he was with the Colorado Rockies and considered one of the best players in baseball because of his play at the plate and in the field. It was the first of his five All-Star seasons.\nBut a long list of injuries hampered a large chunk of Tulowitzki\u2019s prime years. From 2010 to 2017, Tulowitzki averaged just 107 games a season.\nThe last two years have been more trying: Because of a fractured right ankle in 2017 and surgery to remove bone spurs from both heels in 2018, Tulowitzki\u2019s last major league game was July 28, 2017.\nTulowitzki has played with an edge his whole career. And he speaks his mind, as he did after the Rockies surprised him with a blockbuster trade to the Blue Jays in 2015, or after facing Toronto, which released him this off-season because they thought it was unlikely he would be a healthy, above-average shortstop again.\nTulowitzki hit a home run in his first spring training at-bat as a Yankee on Feb. 25, against the Blue Jays no less, and screamed toward his old team\u2019s dugout while rounding the bases.\nThat excitement has since faded against the harsh reality that Tulowitzki has not faced major league pitching in a long time. It is just spring training, but Tulowitzki is 5 for 23 with two home runs and 11 strikeouts. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone still maintains confidence that Tulowitzki\u2019s timing will come around.\nTulowitzki\u2019s path to the Yankees and his connection to Jeter through Gregorius makes for a long, winding story: Had Gregorius\u2019s right elbow ligament not torn last fall and required Tommy John surgery, Tulowitzki would not be here; had the Blue Jays not released Tulowitzki in December after several frustrating seasons, the Yankees would have pursued other options on the trade or free-agent markets, or leaned more heavily on Gleyber Torres, a Yankees second baseman last year, at shortstop.\nBut the ligament did tear and Toronto did release him, so now, nearly a decade after Cashman said Tulowitzki\u2019s name to Jeter\u2019s face, Tulowitzki is here.\nThat was not"}

The worldwide total is $523.8M as holiday distractions give way this coming week. Korea is the next overseas market to open on the Gareth Edwards-helmed spinoff after smartly steering clear of some local titles. That\u2019s ahead of the China bow on January 6 which should be helped by increased awareness in that market after last year\u2019s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and the presence of local stars Jiang Wen and Donnie Yen as part of the Rebel Alliance.\nKeeping in the Middle Kingdom, three of the Top 5 offshore movies this frame made their money there including the Wong Kar-wai-produced See You Tomorrow and the Jackie Chan-starrer Railroad Tigers (see more in the local-language round-up below). China-U.S. co-production The Great Wall, with another $26M in the PROC, now has a cume of $120.1M. The rest of international play will be telling on this title and release outside China begins this week.\nThere were several new openers this frame including Sony\u2019s Passengers with $16.5M; Fox\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed at $14.2M; and Aamir Khan\u2019s Dangal which gave the Bollywood star a new personal best for a worldwide debut at $32.9M.\nAlso of note, Sony opened Resident Evil: The Final Chapter in Japan, well ahead of the rest of the world, and grabbed the No. 1 slot with $9.65M for the four-day on 786 screens. That bests the recent start of Rogue One and is the highest-ever debut for a Resident Evil movie in Japan (+112% over Retribution/+110% over Afterlife). The franchise typically overindexes there, particularly thanks to Japan being the IP\u2019s provenance. This is the top market on each of the previous installments. Further rollout begins January 25 in Korea.\nDespite the past weekend falling smack on Christmas, with cinema closures throughout the world in observance of the holiday, this frame was down just a little over 8% versus last week. Versus last year, when there were likewise three Chinese titles near the top of the pack, the session was down 24.7%.\nThe coming frame sees expansion on existing titles, but no major new releases. Breakdowns have been updated on all films reporting, and local-language pics are highlighted below the original post.\nPREVIOUS, 9:08 AM: Disney/Lucasfilm\u2019s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story made off with a $47.1 million three-day sophomore weekend at the international box office, lifting the overseas cume to $237.4M through Sunday. With a domestic total of $286.4M, the Rebel Alliance has now amassed $523.8M worldwide. The stand-alone spinoff was No. 1 for the second frame in the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hong Kong and more, despite several new entrants.

There is the collective shame a small nation holds when a visitor is attacked or killed. There is also the fact that Sophie Toscan du Plantier the person has been overshadowed by the main suspect in the case, Ian Bailey, a British citizen living in Schull, Co Cork. Most people in Ireland familiar with the case hold at least one strong opinion about Bailey, who denies involvement in the murder.\nThere\u2019s also a feeling that the case is tangled in its own unravelled investigations and court cases. It\u2019s a case that keeps rearing its head, the latest development being that Bailey has failed to halt a French homicide trial.\nNow, a 13-part podcast pores over the case again, the latest in long-form podcasting focusing on true crime. West Cork, released on Thursday by Amazon company Audible, is the result of three years\u2019 reporting, research, and interviewing by Sam Bungey and Jennifer Forde. Forde and Bungey both studied in Dublin. As well as creating this podcast, Forde is a TV documentary producer and researcher, and Bungey is a journalist, who worked on the Irish magazine Mongrel, and has also written for the Guardian and This American Life.\nIreland in 1996 feels like a different country, a place reeling from the IRA bombing of Canary Wharf, where Garda Jerry McCabe was shot dead in Limerick, and journalist Veronica Guerin shot dead in Dublin. The constitutional ban on divorce was repealed after a stunningly narrow referendum win. Michael Collins was in cinemas, and Ireland won the Eurovision with The Voice. And at Christmas, the news was taken over by the discovery of a Frenchwoman\u2019s body outside her holiday home near Schull, in west Cork. It\u2019s that sense of place that forms the easel on which Bungey and Forde paint the story of her death and the subsequent investigation.\nWisely, West Cork is essentially chronological. Bungey and Forde initially read about the case in a UK newspaper, and then sat in on Bailey\u2019s 2014 case against the State in the High Court in Dublin.\nWhat Forde and Bungey do is go back to the start, go back to the place, go back to the people. Across the podcast, the breadth of their research and interviews is impressive. There are Toscan du Plantier\u2019s family members, garda\u00ed involved in the investigation, journalists who reported on it, locals who were involved in the case, people with conflicting theories, memories and versions of the truth. And there is other source material, such as a video tape of the local Christmas swim, where Bailey happens to offer a bizarre and shocking soundbite. There are the Bandon tapes, the secret recordings of Garda station phone calls. There is radio archive from the time.\nThere is also Bailey himself, who appears early on, but is only revealed as a person of interest as the episodes progress \u2013 hardly a spoiler for an Irish audience, but a dramatic moment for those new to the case, one imagines.\nAll of this is produced to a high standard, weaving a narrative that encourages binge-listening.\nIt could be argued in an Irish context there has been almost too much reporting on the case, but West Cork repositions events and information in a way that offers a deeper and more manageable understanding of the events as they occurred than can"}

He joked that people ask him whether he'll run for mayor in 2019 but said his stubborn nature makes him a bad fit for politics.\nBut when Chicago cops come up to him, he realizes how much he misses the job.\nAnd he told me so during a lengthy interview for \"The Chicago Way,\" the podcast on WGN Plus that I do with WGN-AM producer Jeff Carlin.\n\"They don't feel the administration (City Hall) has their back,\" McCarthy said. \"And every police officer I see basically says two things to me.\nClick here for the latest episodes.\n\"I keep hearing that over and over again, and that goes to legitimacy,\" McCarthy said. \"You need legitimate government to have a legitimate police department. And I'm not sure anybody believes we have that in the city of Chicago.\"\nBased on a report from the city's inspector general, Johnson has moved to fire seven police officers involved in the McDonald case, in which a white cop, Jason Van Dyke, shot the teenager McDonald 16 times until dead.\nMcCarthy moved immediately to strip Van Dyke of his police powers, then later was fired after political heat engulfed the mayor for his own handling of dashcam video that captured the shooting.\nMost of the seven cops Johnson wants to fire are patrol officers who backed up Van Dyke's version of events. Two higher-ranking cops mentioned in the IG's report retired. Lt. Anthony Wojcik left months ago, and former Deputy Chief David McNaughton conveniently retired just days ago as the IG's report was delivered.\nMcCarthy questioned the hammer being dropped on the other cops before Van Dyke's murder case is tried.\n\"I'm confused because you never ever, ever, in 35 years of police work, I've never heard of proceeding with an administrative case when you have the criminal case pending.\n\"The IG's investigation is not criminal in nature, it's administrative,\" he said. \"Saying we're going to fire some officers based upon whether their statements were perjury or not jeopardizes a criminal case.\n\"I don't understand why all the rules have been thrown out the window now.\"\nIt leaves Johnson in a difficult place. He's trying to repair crippled police morale while responding to legitimate public outcry over use-of-force cases.

Demands don't count.\nAnd Rahm needs distance from his cops, so he babbles on about a Chinese wall between City Hall and the police, as if he's never put his fingers in the pie.\nIt does give Johnson some cover, though, since the mayor wouldn't dare interfere with him now.\n"}

The system varies power between the gasoline engine and electric motor, or combines both, as needed. A 7.6-second zero-to-60 acceleration time places the Camry Hybrid\u2019s performance between the four-cylinder and V6 models. Lower rolling resistance 17-inch size tires also help boost fuel economy.\nIn pursuit of ultimate efficiency, there are situations in which the gasoline engine shuts off for electric propulsion, while air conditioning and power steering systems are driven electrically. The proven nickel-metal-hydride battery, located in the trunk area, features enhanced air-cooling. Regenerative braking in the Camry Hybrid converts the electric motor to a generator that captures the kinetic energy from the still-turning wheels when the brake is applied, storing it in the hybrid battery pack. Putting the shifter into \u201cB\u201d uses the system as a form of engine braking for enhanced control on steep descents. Hill-start assist control helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backward when starting off on an incline when the brake pedal is released.\nThe Camry Hybrid employs an elegantly simple but modern exterior form, emphasizing a wide, lower stance than previous models. The LE and XLE feature additional exterior chrome trim than the base Camry models. Additionally, fog lights are standard on the XLE grade.\nIn use since the 2012 model year, the Camry Hybrid\u2019s rigid body structure uses a greater amount of high tensile steel than the previous model and even stronger high tensile strength sheet steel. The McPherson-strut front suspension and proven dual-link rear suspension were tuned to give this generation Camry Hybrid superior straight-line stability and crisper steering response, while also enhancing overall ride comfort.\nInside the passenger cabin, the Camry Hybrid interior emphasizes spaciousness and comfort. Soft textures used on the upper instrument panel, upper door trim, door panels, armrests, and center console armrest contribute to refined comfort. Stitching on the instrument panel soft padding and matching stitching-look trim elsewhere helps to create a sense of luxury. Aluminum-color and chrome trim are used judiciously.\nHybrid-exclusive trim is used on the instrument panel and door switch bases, upper console panels and shift knob. The Camry Hybrid also features its own exclusive seat fabric in ivory or light gray, and an exclusive leather-trimmed and Ultrasuede\u00ae is also available.\nA Hybrid-exclusive instrument cluster with Hybrid System Indicator and fuel consumption indicator helps the driver to operate the car as economically as possible. Instantaneous fuel economy is shown with LEDs (light emitting diodes) around the outside of the average fuel economy gauge.

They conclude there is \"no reliable data indicating that administration of vaccines containing thimerosal is a primary cause of autism. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that the individual gene profile and/or gene- environment interactions may play a role in modulating the response to acquired risk by modifying the individual susceptibility.\"\nAschner and Ceccatelli first discuss all the possible exposures to mercury that occur in the environment. There's a lot of potential exposures to mercury, with fish being the primary exposure to methylmercury.\nIt makes almost no sense on a practical level for parents to be raging against thimerosal while ignoring the reality that their children's exposure to methylmercury is far more pervasive.\nAschner and Ceccatelli note that thimerosal was removed from vaccines under the assumption that toxicity would be similar to methylmercury exposure, but that since that removal, \"it has been shown that the kinetics of tissues disposition and metabolism differ from those for MeHg.\" They continue: \"While the scientific literature supports the concept that MeHg is a potent developmental neurotoxin, the assertion that thimerosal leads to developmental disorders in children is hypothetical and unsubstantiated, resting on indirect and incomplete information, primarily from analogies with MeHg.\"\nAs a purely precautionary action, reducing thimerosal exposure made practical sense while conducting studies to look at the potential for neurotoxicity. Unfortunately, we know that those who latched onto thimerosal as a potential cause of autism, have used this cautionary act as proof that the government and pharma knew it was a problem. It's evident from careful and exhaustive reading of parents who buy into the vaccine causation theory that facts and evidence aren't necessary for this belief system to maintain itself more fervently over time and as each potential theory is shot down.\nSafety studies on thimerosal have now been conducted. So have studies looking at autism rates as thimerosal was removed from vaccines. Aschner and Ceccatelli conclude from these studies: \"Simply stated, MeHg is not a suitable reference for evaluating ethylmercury toxicity. Key observations to substantiate this statement include the following: (1) mercury clears from the body much faster after the administration of ethylmercury than after the administration of MeHg; (2) the brain-to-blood mercury concentration ratio established for MeHg will overestimate mercury in the brain after exposure to ethylmercury; and (3) because ethylmercury decomposes much faster than MeHg, the risk of brain damage is less for ethylmercury than for MeHg.\"\nstudies have largely failed in finding a significant correlation between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. However, efforts to reduce the exposure of infants, children, and pregnant women to any form of mercury from various sources should continue.\""}

Are Chicago audiences good audiences?\nA. I think Chicago audiences are perhaps the best audiences in the United States and maybe worldwide. It's a big city with a big city mentality and energy, but it's got that Midwest hospitality, and they're humble and hungry for music.\nQ. You don't think they talk too much and are a little too social during sets?\nA. Sometimes there's a little bit of that in any city, really. I'm kind of used to that within the scene and subculture of the so-called jam band. People not only go for the music, but to hang with friends. I don't expect to have full control over everyone in the audience, but I do the best to get their attention and keep it.\nQ. As a hometowner, where do you think the best music venue in Chicago is?\nA. I'm a little biased, but my favorite shows, with all things considered, would be at a club like Martyrs'. It's a real comfortable venue that sounds really great. Big, beautiful rooms are also awesome. The Aragon brings a certain nostalgia value to the experience, but if you ask any musician, acoustic-wise it's awful. You have to have a really great sound crew that knows what they're doing and we're lucky that we do. If it were big venues, the Chicago Theatre and the Auditorium Theatre are two of my favorites.\nQ. How much are the two shows going to sound the same?\nA. They're going to be different. That's the way it is. The band abides by a certain rule that we have a certain rotation to play in our set lists. That's what our fans expect. We may play the same song from one night to the next, but we may extend sections of a song that wasn't like it was the night before. It's not like a lot of pop acts where it's like listening to the album at the concert. You might as well just listen to the album in your car. Luckily, we have a fan base that wants the complete opposite of that.\nQ. How did you guys come up with the album title \"Death by Stereo?\"\nA. You go through a lot of ideas and sometimes things just come up randomly. We put a list together and talk about it and the general feel of the album.

When asked if the learning is making any difference in their lives, almost every one of them indicates it has. Equally impressive, the sentiments of queried local educators and counselors working with Mindful Schools teacher and mentor Sally Arnold, a Sonora resident, also seem to lean that way.\nInitially hired to bring her Oakland-based Mindful Schools training to West Point Elementary in Calaveras County, as part of a pilot program through First 5 Calaveras, with funding through the Mental Health Service Act (MHSA), Arnold now spends two days a week visiting classrooms there as a mentor. A board-trained holistic nurse for the past two decades, Arnold earned her masters in psychology and brings an extensive background in pediatrics, hospice and public health into her teaching. While she continues to instruct foster and adoptive parent certification programs at Columbia College, as a certified Mindful Schools instructor, she has honed her focus these past three years towards providing mindful behavioral learning to students, teachers and counselors.\nArnold points to a recent Harvard University study, which identifies that we spend about 52 percent of our lives outside of the present moment \u2014 and the balance of it either worrying about the future or ruminating about the past, even more so when we are under stress. As she explains it, by not paying enough thoughtful attention to the here-and-now, we set up ourselves to lead with our emotions from the primitive \u201ccaveman\u201d part of our brain \u2014 the amygdala \u2014 which is geared to impulsively respond to stimulation in \u201cfight or flight\u201d mode.\nThere are no \u201cbad\u201d kids, Arnold maintains, calling bullying and other negative behaviors simply \u201cmaking poor choices.\u201d Often she sees that parents are doing the best they can with their children but may lack the tools, due to deficit of education, overwhelming personal or domestic issues, or substance abuse problems. While behavioral interventions for bullying and suicide prevention with older students have their place, Arnold states, starting kids younger with mindfulness training can, from a neuroscience perspective, actually evolve their neural pathways.\nFor a visual, all-ages \u201cnutshell\u201d overview of how kids describe their own mindfulness training experiences, Arnold points to \u201cJust Breathe,\u201d a very short, unscripted video made by two of her Oakland colleagues, Julie Bayer Salzman and Josh Salzman (click to view it here).\nRhetorically, she asks, \u201cIf we can offer you tools that maybe take 30 seconds or three minutes maximum and change the outcome of your day, would you do it? Of course, you would.\u201d Through teaching what she calls \u201cthe ABCs of Mindfulness (Awareness, Being present and Compassionate), Arnold says that kids learn self-compassion, which allows them to feel good about themselves for who they are, enabling them to shift from a reactive survival existence to one where they can use their brains to think and thrive. Students practicing mindfulness, Arnold says, realize that if emotions escalate it is all to easy to \u201cflip our lid.\u201d By taking time to calm down and think, they are able to remove themselves from a situation where they might make a regretful response.\nIn addressing bullying, for example, Arnold remarks, \u201cMindfulness creates awareness of the situation\u2026of our power and, I think, in bullying situations, you need to remove yourself"}

The story focuses on a young woman dealing with an immortal vampire-like child killer who takes his victims to Christmasland, a creepy imaginary world where it\u2019s Christmas every day. A new NOS4A2 teaser is here, and while it\u2019s short on footage, it\u2019s big on atmosphere. In addition to that, a slew of images from the show have arrived as well.\nAs far as teasers go, there\u2019s not a whole lot here. In fact, to me, this footage looks like it will be the opening credits of the show \u2013 it has that same sort of abstract vibe that most horror show opening credits have. The closer we get to the show\u2019s premiere date, the more actual footage we\u2019ll see. For now, though, it\u2019s clear the series is striving to be as creepy as possible, and that\u2019s promising. Joe Hill\u2019s book had a lot of great ideas in it, and I look forward to seeing how the show goes about adapting them.\nHere\u2019s the official NOS4A2 synopsis.\nAshleigh Cummings will play Vic McQueen, a young, working-class artist whose creativity awakens a supernatural ability to track Manx (Zachary Quinto). What Vic lacks in social confidence, she makes up for in courage, humor, and tough-as-nails grit. She strives to defeat Manx and rescue his victims without losing her mind or falling victim to him herself.\nThis is pretty close to the book, with one major change: in Hill\u2019s novel, Vic is a little bit older, and she has a son being targeted by Manx. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here, and honestly, I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019m much more interested in Vic as a character than her son, and I actually think this change might end up making the show even better than the book.\nIn addition to that teaser, here are some new images, revealing the characters on the show.\nHere\u2019s Charlie Manx, as played by Zachary Quinto. I don\u2019t remember the character being so young and handsome in the book \u2013 he\u2019s basically a hideous ghoul there. So that might be one distinct change. Manx feeds on the souls of children, so obviously he\u2019s bad news. He\u2019s also leaning up against his car, the Wraith, which he uses to travel between time and dimensions.\nAnd here\u2019s Manx again, in his decrepit form. This is more closer to his book look. Once again, the Wraith waits in the background. Fun fact: Manx is the type of soul-sucking vampire that also appears in Doctor Sleep. Doctor Sleep is the sequel to The Shining, written by Joe Hill\u2019s father, Stephen King. King even mentions Manx in the book. There\u2019s a Doctor Sleep movie hitting theaters later this year \u2013 will the two tie into each other? I doubt it, but now you have some useless trivia to store in your brain!\nVic McQueen, as played by Ashleigh Cummings, has a psychic connection to Manx, which makes her a target for him. Cummings appeared in the horrifying film Hounds of Love, and she was fantastic there, so I\u2019m excited to see more of her.\nAnd here are two pics of Vic on her bike.

Unfortunately, Mr. Bush wasn't convinced by his own reassurances, and went on to propose a whopping new package of tax cuts. This plan is much less about the economy than about the White House's belief that it needs to take action, any action, to show that the president cares.\nMr. Bush is understandably haunted by his father's loss of the presidency in 1992, when the elder Bush seemed indifferent to the economic hardships experienced by many voters. But in this plan, the concern is only for the posture. The president's program itself is a cynical grab bag of unrelated and mislabeled policies that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest, along with belated support for the extension of expired unemployment benefits and a small new federal program to help people find jobs. Inexcusably, the package includes no assistance for states struggling to keep up with rising security and health care costs.\nThe president sounded impassioned yesterday in railing against the double taxation of dividends. That, as we have already said, is a worthy subject for a tax reform seminar, but not for an economic stimulus proposal. Few conceivable tax cuts could do less to provide immediate help to the people with overextended credit card debt who Mr. Bush claimed were the focus of his concern.\nHe was equally unconvincing in calling for the acceleration of income tax rate cuts passed by Congress in 2001. This too would prove a huge drain on the Treasury at a time of a quarter-trillion-dollar deficit and mounting national security obligations, with only a minimal immediate boost to consumer spending.\nWith the economy showing signs of recovery, we remain unpersuaded of the need for a pricey stimulus package. Yet if Mr. Bush is truly concerned about the people who ''spend their entire adult lives living paycheck to paycheck,'' he should be pushing a more targeted plan along the lines proposed Monday by Congressional Democrats. At less than one-fourth the $674 billion cost of the president's extravagant designs, their plan provides short-term relief to states and working-class Americans, thereby doing more to insure against an economic slowdown."}

For teachers, prospective teachers, and parents, the book explains the craft of teaching and addresses ways to help students develop thinking skills. Mr. Kohl advises teachers to be flexible with course content, to focus on student discussion and experimentation, and to be willing to adjust subject-area content to student responses. In stories of classroom experiences, tales of his early teaching years, and anecdotes about students and fellow teachers, the author shares his views on developing young minds.

The sophistication of the attacks used to gather those credentials and thwart the increasingly complex authentication process that guards financial transactions is sometimes staggering. That's because they require not just stealth but coordination across multiple touch points in the transaction process.\nMITB is not a new technique. It was first identified as a potential path to financial theft back in 2005 when Augusto Paes de Barros presented it as part of his \"The future of backdoors - worst of all worlds\". MITB didn't receive its \"official\" title until it was so named in 2007 by Philipp G\u00fchring. In 2008, Trojans with MITB capabilities began to surface: Zeus. Torpig. Clampi. Citadel.\nMost financial targeting Trojan malware are able to capture a wide variety of behavior and data as well as enabling remote control via VNC and RDP. They range from keylogging and grabbing and more recently have begun taking advantage of the mobile explosion in order to bypass multi-factor authentication requirements that leverage SMS to deliver OTP or TAN to legitimate users.\nThese Trojans accomplish these feats using MITB to inject scripts into legitimate banking web applications to extract and deliver credentials to dropzones. These scripts are dangerous not only because of the amount of data they can collect; that's true of just about any Trojan that inserts itself into the user environment. These scripts are dangerous because they become part of the application logic. MITB essentially changes the client side of a web application, giving it potentially new and dangerous capabilities such as modifying the details of transactions in real time. You might think you'd notice that, but because it's in the browser and modifying the business logic it can hide those changes from you, at least for a few days.\nFinancial institutions attempting to put a stop to these fraudulent activities often implement two-factor authentication. Logging in with simple credentials is not enough; a second password or code is delivered via a secondary channel such as via SMS in order to authenticate the user.\nBut even this is not always enough. As our F5 SOC research team recently showed, Neverquest is able to abuse user's trust in their banking institutions against them. In addition to the typical MITB script injection designed to steal credentials, Neverquest attempts to coerce users into also installing an application on their mobile device, designed to capture and deliver secondary authentication codes and passwords as well. Successfully doing so means attackers can execute automated transactions against the users financial accounts.\nGiven that 73% of users are unable to distinguish between real and fake popup messages (Sharek, et al 2008, \"Failure to Recognize Fake Internet Popup Warning Messages\") the potential for Neverquest and similar Trojans to succeed in such efforts is more likely than not, particularly when those popups are presented by a trusted site such as a financial institution.\nThe key to detecting these script-injecting, app modifying monsters is to understand the state of the web application page at the time it's delivered - before the Trojan has a chance to modify it - as well as monitoring for duplicate communication initiated from the web page. These are both methods used by web anti-fraud solutions to detect infected clients. A small protective script is included in each and every page that can detect attempts to modify the logic as well as notice duplicate communications and can notify the user immediately.\nYou can learn more about Neverquest, how it works and how to mitigate it from our F5 SOC analysis of the mal"}

This is particularly true of the permanent five members, all of whom have the power to veto any resolution that comes their way.\nSo it is impossible not to ask: What is motivating France in aggressively championing international military intervention in Libya and Cote D'Ivoire?\nThe Security Council resolutions authorising the use of force in these two domestic conflicts, the first written by France and the UK, the second by France and Nigeria, were justified by the need to protect civilians who were increasingly being targeted in both domestic conflicts.\nBut why choose these two countries to make a stand when civilians fighting for democracy are under fire in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and elsewhere?\nWhere was the UN Security Council when peaceful Egyptians stood up to tanks in Tahrir Square? Or when thousands of Tamils were caught in the crossfire of Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war in 2009?\n\"Frankly, we did it because we could,\" France's ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud, told me when we sat down for an interview recently at the French mission.\nIn Libya, the support of former Libyan officials and the Arab League were key to winning over countries like Russia and China, which are generally reluctant to intervene in domestic affairs that are not necessarily a threat to international peace and security, said Araud. And no one was willing to stand up for Libya's Muammar Gaddafi.\n\"First, it was the urgency,\" said Araud of Security Council Resolution 1973. \"If Gaddafi had taken Benghazi, it would have been a bloodbath. Secondly, we had the request of regional organisations, so there was the emotion of world public opinion. And Gaddafi was really the bad guy, so we could do it.\"\nResolution 1973 set the stage for 1975, authorising unusually robust UN action in Cote D'Ivoire. UN and French helicopters took out heavy weapons which they said were being used against civilians and peacekeepers.\nDoing so allowed forces loyal to internationally recognised president, Alessane Outarra, to finally unseat former president Laurent Gbagbo from power, but also opened the door to critics like Russia's freign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who accused the UN of picking sides in an internal dispute.\nSome experts believe France is acting in its own self-interest in Libya and Cote D'Ivoire.\nArthur Goldhammer, a writer and translator at Harvard University's Minda de Gunzberg, argues in Foreign Policy magazine that France's aggressive posture in Libya is due to \"Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s misguided quest for glory\".\nWith waning popularity at home, the French president may have believed that leading a high-minded intervention could help him in next year's election.\nHe may also have wanted to cover up his government's embarrassing response to pro-democracy demonstrations in Tunisia, which led to the resignation of his former foreign minister, Michele Alliot-Marie.\nIn addition to some questionable personal dealings with cronies of dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Alliot-Marie had offered to send"}

Today, there is a new Mason-Dixon line in America. This time, it\u2019s a dividing line for Medicaid, one of the country\u2019s most important health insurance programs.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, all states can now expand Medicaid coverage to almost all their poor and near-poor residents. But almost half of our states are saying no. This expansion of Medicaid comes with almost full federal funding, which means that money is not driving these decisions.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent refusal to pull health care subsidies from 6.4 million Americans over some imprecise wording in the Affordable Care Act was a mercy. But health care remains a stark and shameful instance of the nation\u2019s failure to overcome persistent racial disparities.\nThat owes in part to an earlier Supreme Court ruling. Originally, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion was supposed to be implemented across the board, in every state. But the in 2012 the Supreme Court gave states the option of rejecting the expansion. This led to the shocking coverage gap we have today.\nAs of the beginning of this year, 3.8 million low-income adults lacked health insurance as a result of these rejections. These are people with incomes too high for their states\u2019 regular Medicaid programs but too low to qualify for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies for private coverage.\nThose pushed beyond the health care margins are disproportionately people of color. The Kaiser Family Fund has calculated that 27 percent of the uninsured are African American and 24 percent are Latino. Most of these people live in states of the Old Confederacy.\nBy picking up the Medicaid expansion, Texas alone could deliver health insurance to more than three-quarters of a million people, including more than a half-million Latinos and 160,000 African Americans. But the state has chosen not to do so.\nBehind the figures are real people whose lives depend on the health coverage that Medicaid provides. They need this insurance for heart medication, chemotherapy treatments, and the routine exams that can detect cardiovascular disease and cancer. These families face devastating financial consequences \u2014 more than half of all bankruptcies are due to medical bills.\nThe Affordable Care Act is now delivering coverage to 10 million Americans who were previously shut out of the health insurance system. And due to persistent racial disparities in coverage, most of those who remain uninsured live on the wrong side of the Medicaid Mason-Dixon line.\nTexas and other states that are refusing Medicaid expansion are telling millions of residents of their states that their lives are not valued or worthy of protection. Now, more than ever, we need to show that we value all lives.\nIt\u2019s not too late for state lawmakers to place themselves on the right side of the Medicaid Mason-Dixon line."}

We\u2019ll update if any more significant claims emerge.\nA note of caution: Many of these claims are based on interviews other journalists conducted with unnamed sources. We don\u2019t use unnamed sources at PolitiFact, so we couldn\u2019t independently verify their reports.\nClaim 1: Putin ordered operatives to influence the U.S. presidential election and sought to elect Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nEvidence: Of the allegations tying Trump to Russia, this one has the most thorough confirmation from the government \u2014 notably a Jan. 6, 2017, report out of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The report said Putin himself \"ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\" Agents also concluded that the Russian government prefered Trump over Clinton, and they intended to undermine Americans\u2019 faith in the electoral system.\nPrivate cybersecurity analysts have said for months that all signs point to Russia.\nIn the most high-profile example of their election interference, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors also gained access to several states\u2019 electoral agencies. There is no evidence, however, that Russia tampered with vote tallying on Election Day.\nExperts also believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign \u2014 such as state-backed Russian media, like RT and Sputnik, pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media, get picked up by English-speaking conspiratorial websites, and sometimes make it into Trump\u2019s hands.\nU.S. government response: Reacting to Russia\u2019s malicious cyber activity during the election, former President Barack Obama imposed new sanctions on Russia in December 2016.\nDuring the campaign and in the weeks following the election, Trump avoided naming Russia as the perpetrator of election-related cyber attacks. But he conceded the point in a pre-inauguration news conference Jan. 11, 2017.\nClaim 2: Russia has tried for years to manipulate Trump using lucrative business deals, and Russian operatives have collected compromising information that could potentially be used to blackmail Trump.\nEvidence: These allegations are based on a 35-page dossier of opposition research on Trump, prepared by a former British intelligence officer hired by Trump\u2019s Republican and Democratic rivals during the election. The dossier contained numerous explosive but unverified claims.\nThe man who prepared the original 35-page dossier, Christopher Steele, is respected for his intelligence work, particularly in Russia.

At the same time, SBC pastors planted almost 300 new churches, bringing the total number of SBC churches to about 46,800.\nChurch membership dropped by about 204,000 people to 15.3 million, and average weekly attendance dropped by about 97,000 people to 5.6 million.\nIn contrast, undesignated giving increased more than $406 million to surpass $9 billion.\nGiving to Great Commission ministry programs was down by about $24 million to $613 million, but since October, giving to North American and international ministries has been rebounding, SBC president Ronnie Floyd noted in his reaction to the report.\nMeanwhile, nearly 1 in 5 SBC churches fail to report their annual stats for the ACP. Thus, the number of non-reporting churches (which hovers between 8,000 and 10,000, and was 8,661 in 2015) could be adversely affecting baptism numbers, Floyd stated. If each of those churches baptised about 8 people, that would mean baptisms could be as much as 67,036 higher, he wrote.\n\u201c[A]s long as we have this many non-reporting churches, it\u2019s hard to know where we really are,\u201d he wrote.\nThe 2015 ACP looks a lot like last year\u2019s, which revealed 985 new SBC churches and a loss of more than 230,000 members. In fact, 2015 was the 9th year out of 11 that the SBC reported fewer baptisms, but the 17th year in a row that the number of churches has grown.\nThe reaction of SBC leaders was mixed.\nFloyd sounded much the same.\nLifeWay president and CEO Thom Rainer was more upbeat.\nLast week, the AG reported a gain of 48 churches and about 45,000 adherents (those who consider an AG church to be their church home) in 2015, bringing its total number of American adherents to 3.2 million. It was the AG\u2019s 26th year of increased membership.\nWorldwide, the AG grew by 1 percent, or 702,000, to reach nearly 68 million adherents.\nCT has covered the growth of AG, its increasing diversity (less than 60% of US adherents are white), and its decrease of speaking in tongues and \u201cspirit baptisms.\u201d CT blogger Ed Stetzer explored why Pentecostals are growing so rapidly.\nCT noted last year how Southern Baptists are disappearing as church plants grow."}

Gardner worked in Asia between 2001 and 2009 and has held positions with Hill & Knowlton in Hong Kong, Edelman in Taiwan (he was an MD there), and worked at media organizations in those countries as well as Bangkok, Thailand.\nDuring our conversation, Gardner talked about the importance of social media and the impact that the concept of \u201cguanxi,\u201d a term loosely translated to mean \u201crelationships,\u201d is having. And Gardner talked about the impact that the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is having on other parts of the region.\n\u201cIn certain markets, including Taiwan and Thailand, Japanese pop culture, Japanese consumer electronics, Japanese food, all of these things have huge brand equity and have always been very popular,\u201d he said. Charitable donations are being collected in high-traffic areas across the region.\nFinally, we discussed the importance of thinking in local terms. In Taiwan, even Starbucks, Gardner notes, had to take cues from a local coffee purveyor in order to keep up.\nHow has Asia changed even since you were there?\nFacebook is seeing tremendous growth in Taiwan \u2014 I think 30 to 40 percent growth in the last six months \u2014 and it\u2019s now at [about] 43 percent penetration, which is basically the same rate of penetration we have in the U.S. It\u2019s a market where culture helps to dominate social networks. You have very close-knit social groups. It was naturally a place that was predisposed to be accepting of social networks and ways of socializing with your networks. On Facebook for example, it\u2019s something that you can create as big or small a social network as you want to.\nThere have been other attempts, especially in places like China, to create things like Facebook or some other social network. In Japan there\u2019s something called Mixi that\u2019s very popular and Facebook is trying to compete with them.\nBut in Taiwan, what I\u2019ve seen is a huge escalation in the use of Facebook and not yet a deep understanding of how we\u2019re going to use that for marketing or communications or PR. Of course, we\u2019re still trying to understand that here. So nobody has figured that out in Asia either but it seems like based on what I\u2019ve said about culture and society, it\u2019s the perfect market. You have Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, all of these North Asian societies where a lot of marketing has always been word-of-mouth. So the potential is immense. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if 10 years from now, it\u2019s a much bigger business in Asia than it is here.\nRecently, I spoke with executives from the Worldcom network and they talked about social networks in the EMEA region, specifically in Europe, and how many of them are local. For instance, where Facebook and Twitter are making inroads, in-language and local social networks are already very popular. Is that something you see in Asia as well?\nYes, you absolutely do. The simple uninformed way of looking at is they see Facebook, they see Twitter, and they just copy it. Well yes and no. The basic idea of social networking is a similar concept. But there are often localized versions of it. Mixi is huge in Japan, they got an earlier start, local market knowledge, and Facebook is trying to compete in the market.\nChina is a special situation where the government has a lot of say in what kinds of communications services are going"}

On Saturday, the shutdown became the longest in U.S. history, currently stretching into its fourth week, at 26 days.\nThinkProgress spoke with federal workers and contractors who are making tough choices about whether or not to look for other jobs, or stay in the federal government even if they are able to get back to work soon. The employees quoted in this story asked not to be identified by their actual names out of fear of retaliation.\nDrew, a federal worker within the Department of Agriculture, said the shutdown is particularly difficult for them as they\u2019re in their 20s and in the beginning of their career. When asked what they\u2019re doing to stay afloat financially, Drew said they\u2019re not going anywhere or doing anything that requires spending money. They have cancelled any unnecessary regular spending.\nA 2017 CareerBuilder report that polled 2,000 managers and more than 3,000 full-time employees found that 78 percent of full-time workers said they lived paycheck to paycheck. Drew added that it\u2019s particularly tough that they can\u2019t help cover expenses for their group house, which affects everyone else they live with.\nAnne, a contractor who works with the Bureau of Lands Management, has started filing for unemployment. Contractors did not receive backpay during the 2013 shutdown and it isn\u2019t expected that they will receive backpay after this one, unlike federal workers. Even the process of filing for unemployment reminded her that she isn\u2019t considered as affected by the shutdown as federal workers. One of the questions she had to answer was whether she was a federal employee affected by the shutdown, but since she\u2019s a contractor she was told to answer that she had been laid off due to lack of work.\nDrew and Lee, a federal worker at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that they believe the shutdown may result in a wave of federal workers leaving their government jobs.\nDrew said they think a lot of people who have worked for the government for a decade or longer will either leave through early retirement or by changing jobs. They added that a lot of people have already started looking for new jobs, which means the government could lose considerable talent and consistency in agencies.\nLee said the administration has been \u201chostile\u201d to government workers since it began.\nMost of the federal workers and contractors who spoke with ThinkProgress said they put at least some of the blame on Trump, as well as Republican members of Congress. A majority of Americans share their views. According to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS, a market and survey research firm, 55 percent of people surveyed said Trump is more to blame for the shutdown than Congressional Democrats. President Trump\u2019s approval rating has also dipped five points since last month.\nLee, a federal worker at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is worried that the media coverage has been centered only on House Democrats and the president.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an entire other legislative body.

However, in some of those strikes, the CIA did not know the identity of the victims. NBC's Richard Engel reports.\nThe CIA did not always know who it was targeting and killing in drone strikes in Pakistan over a 14-month period, an NBC News review of classified intelligence reports shows.\nAbout one of every four of those killed by drones in Pakistan between Sept. 3, 2010, and Oct. 30, 2011, were classified as \"other militants,\u201d the documents detail. The \u201cother militants\u201d label was used when the CIA could not determine the affiliation of those killed, prompting questions about how the agency could conclude they were a threat to U.S. national security.\nThree former senior Obama administration officials also told NBC News that some White House officials were worried that the CIA had painted too rosy a picture of its success and likely ignored or missed mistakes when tallying death totals.\nNBC News has reviewed two sets of classified documents that describe 114 drone strikes over 14 months in Pakistan and Afghanistan, starting in September 2010. The documents list locations, death and injury tolls, alleged terrorist affiliations, and whether the killed and injured were deemed combatants or non-combatants.\nIn some cases, U.S. officials also seem unsure how many people died. One entry says that a drone attack killed seven to 10 people, while another says that an attack killed 20 to 22.\nYet officials seem certain that however many people died, and whoever they were, none of them were non-combatants. In fact, of the approximately 600 people listed as killed in the documents, only one is described as a civilian. The individual was identified to NBC News as the wife or girlfriend of an al Qaeda leader.\nMicah Zenko, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says that more civilians and non-combatants have likely been killed by U.S. drone strikes than the Obama administration has claimed.\nThe CIA declined to comment, and the White House did not immediately respond to calls and emails requesting comment. Important reporting on the subject also was done previously by McClatchy Newspapers.\nSeparately, on background, the official noted that as President Barack Obama said in an address last month, as the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan declines, so will the number of strikes.\nThe CIA uses two basic methods to target people for killing, according to current and former U.S. officials.\nThe first is called a \u201cpersonality\u201d strike. These strikes target known terrorists, whose identities have been firmly established through intelligence, including visual surveillance and electronic and human intelligence. In other words, the CIA knows who it is killing.\nIn so-called \u201csignature\u201d strikes, intelligence officers and drone operators kill suspects based on their patterns of behavior -- but without positive identification. With signature strikes, the CIA doesn\u2019t necessarily know who it is killing. One former senior intelligence official said that at the height of the drone program in Pakistan in 2009 and 2010, as many as half of the strikes were classified as signature strikes.\nAnalysts use a variety of intelligence methods and technologies that they say give them reasonable certainty that the \u201csignature\u201d target is a terrorist.

The film, which stars Tom Holland as a fresh-faced Peter Parker, gives us our best version of the character as well as the most realistic, most diverse on-screen version of Queens in a Spider-Man film. There are a ton of positives with this film, as well as some food for thought, so without further ado, let\u2019s get into it.\nSpider-Man: Homecoming might be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s Phase 3, but I\u2019m considering it the second phase of evolution in Marvel\u2019s storytelling ability. As we\u2019ve gone along the MCU journey, we\u2019ve seen the films get more and more\u2026dudebro. That doesn\u2019t mean that the films aren\u2019t fun, but the storytelling has definitely begun to suffer from formulaic sameness \u2014 just take a look at Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 and the trailer for Thor: Ragnarok. Everything from the tone, the retro music selection, and even the films\u2019 logos suffer from Marvel doing things that have worked in the past too doggone much. Ditto for the MCU\u2019s overwhelming white male centrism. Again, the focus on the heroic white male archetype puts the films into staid, dudebro territory. With such adherence to a certain formula, especially during the last few films, it\u2019s felt like Marvel\u2019s telling the same story over and over again.\nHowever, Spider-Man: Homecoming injects much-needed zest and freshness into the MCU. Instead of focusing on the same \u201cI\u2019m amazing at everything\u201d heroic archetype, we\u2019re focusing on a kid who is so eager to be a part of the big leagues of superheroism, the Avengers. Peter Parker\u2019s appeal in the comics is that he\u2019s a kid who is trying to juggle life like the rest of us, and just like us, he makes oodles of mistakes along the way. Most of Peter\u2019s fights in this film largely consists of him making huge mistakes, and seeing a superhero flail along in his journey is not only humorous in its own right, but also relatable.\nSpider-Man: Homecoming also lifts the tone of the Marvel franchise, which has so far wavered between balls-to-the-wall comedy and seriousness (all set to big budget action sequences, of course). In Spider-Man: Homecoming, we spend the movie with Peter and a ton of relatable, lovable kids (even Tony Revolori\u2019s pseudo-bully Flash is lovable in his own way). Showing Peter\u2019s high school was a much-needed reprieve from maniacal robots, Norse gods, time control, and Captain America\u2019s drama with Bucky. (We do see Chris Evans\u2019 Cap in this film, though, but in the form of government-backed PSAs about national fitness challenges and staying out of detention.) As many outlets have already said, the film\u2019s light-yet-earnest tone was something straight out of a John Hughes movie, and that approach was the shot in the arm Marvel Studios sorely needed.\nTo top it off, we also spend time in the lived-in borough of Queens, a move that successfully ties Spider"}

Booking a waiting list ticket not just makes a journey unpredictable but also causes huge inconvenience to the traveller. Making situations worst, there hasn\u2019t been a feasible solution to the unpredictability of \u2018Waiting List\u2019 for ages, resulting in last minute cancellation of plan. It was a few such experiences that sparked the idea of ConfirmTkt in Sripad and Dinesh Kotha. In 2010 when they were working in Bangalore, they realised the existing gap in market while trying to book tickets for their home town Hyderabad.\nThe frustration and helplessness of a waitlisted ticket made then research further on the probability of ticket confirmation, which was when they found a pattern. It took them almost 2 years to collect all the previous data and analyse the pattern for better accuracy. By 2012, they were able to build a complete algorithm which can predict the chances of confirmation of a waitlisted ticket. Built with the help of previous data analysis that was accumulated from various repositories across trains and routes in India, the algorithm was able to predict the results most accurately. After further research and work on precision of results, Sripad and Dinesh successfully launched the website Confirmtkt.com in 2014, which was the first of its kind PNR status prediction website.\nWithin no time, the app for iOS, Windows and Android were also launched. Inspite of a few existing competitors like Ixigo, Railyatri and ConfirmTkt was successful in attracting the audience owing its core competencies - prediction accuracy and alternative options to travel (same train alternatives or by break journey). With increasing user base, their confidence and aspiration to offer users a comfortable travel increased. it was initially just a train ticket prediction and booking platform, expansion into other areas of travel space with PNR Search, Train schedule, Live train status, finding alternatives, local Train Search, Bus Booking, cab and auto booking added more value to their product.\nCurrently a team of 15 based in Bangalore, ConfirmTkt has had a significant increase in traction over the past one year with 20-30% increase every month. Incubated by Amendus and featured at G-Start-up 2016 among the top 25 start-ups in Bangalore, ConfirmTkt has a daily user base of 1,25,000 and total app downloads about 1.5 million.

A young man confronted the Birthright guide asking why the West Bank is not shown on the map distributed to the group, that instead names the territory \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d. The guide states that it is Israel\u2019s position that the entire land belongs to Israel\u2026it is part of the country called Israel. This is refreshing to hear stated so blatantly, when for decades, the world has been fed lies about negotiations towards a two state solution. I guess the Israeli settlements spreading like wildfire on top of the Palestinian territories were not a clear enough message that there was never an intention to see a free and contiguous Palestine.\n2. Israel sees indigenous Palestinians, as interlopers, preventing a contiguous Jewish state.\nLet\u2019s get real. What sovereignty do the Palestinians have? Israel in all practical senses has defacto sovereignty over all the land. The \u201csecurity coordination\u201d with the Palestinian Authority is just another brick in the Apartheid wall. The current expired PA government is in collusion with the colonizer, reaping the benefits from the stalemate in \u201cnegotiations\u201d. Israel controls all ports of entry and borders across the land. It claims no control in Gaza strip, while it holds close to 2 million people hostage in what many have called a concentration camp\u2014even controlling the number of calories the average Gazan should consume (https://nyti.ms/2LD5qO3). The Jewish state controls ALL aspects of Palestinian life across the territories, make no mistake.\nSo what does it mean? It means that no matter how you look at it, Israel is an Apartheid state. Not just inside what is known loosely as \u201cIsrael proper\u201d and pertaining to Israeli citizens of Palestinian descent, but across the entire land. Israel\u2019s main mission vis-a-vis the land is two-fold: continue to appropriate more Palestinian land, which it anyway considers a repatriation of Jewish land to restore Eretz Israel and to eliminate as many Palestinians as possible while making the life of millions of other Palestinians completely unbearable by reducing their quality of life and their ability to make a living. The latest Jewish nation state bill, the closest to a living constitution, has just legalized racial segregation and institutionalized discrimination. Ethnic cleansing is not just the killing of Palestinian bodies, but the systematic erasure of Palestinian attachment and claim to the land, history and language. The nation state bill creates a framework for legal ethnic cleansing.\nMillennia of human history have witnessed territories being conquered through war. More often than not, it resulted in migration and a merging of civilizations that resulted in a new nation, where it was more common for the the culture of the conquered and their structures of governance to remain mostly intact and dominant. That\u2019s what should have happened in Palestine in 1948. Instead, it was determined by the Zionist establishment that in order for a Jewish state to emerge, all traces of the indigenous Palestinians must be erased. Much to Israel\u2019s dismay, the Palestinians are still on the land. What is notable is that while Israel continues to feed the world the lie that all that stands in the way of peace is failed negotiations with the Palestinian Authority and the terror kites of Hamas, Israel rules over them all with an Apartheid system not seen since South Africa. And we know how that ended.\nIman Najjar-Annab was until recently a professional research consultant serving large multinationals based in the Middle East. Her interest"}

His famous comment, \u201cMaking money is art and working is art and good business is the best art\u201d sums up the potential of commerce to have a positive impact on art, and vice versa.\nYet these collaborations are not easy. Artistic credibility is hard-won, so it\u2019s tenaciously defended, and a mere suggestion of inauthenticity from brand or artist has the potential to cause lasting damage.\nHow then can brands collaborate successfully with artists?\nIn the early days, it worked for brands to simply buy or commission work, as Pears did with Millais. More recently we have seen brands adopting artists as brand ambassadors. Famously, Diageo linked Diddy with C\u00eeroc vodka to achieve impressive commercial results.\nThere\u2019s a place for these approaches, but in an age of increasing skepticism, the most successful collaborations are those involving a more meaningful partnership between artist and brand, working together from conception to execution and finding solutions that can fundamentally shape a brand.\nArtistic credibility is hard-won, so it\u2019s tenaciously defended, and a mere suggestion of inauthenticity from brand or artist has the potential to cause lasting damage.\nA good example is GE\u2019s work to improve understanding of its ground-breaking developments in neuroscience.

Scientists and artists collaborated to creatively express how the brain responds when it\u2019s in love or how the neural responses of an optimist can differ to those of an introvert. Similarly, the collaboration between artists alongside the entomologists of Raid insecticide brings to life (or death, if viewed from a bug perspective) the effectiveness of the Raid product in a playful and captivating way.\nBoth imaginatively grabbed public attention and show what\u2019s possible when, and rather than simply using artists as promotional tools, brands seed artists in their workflow.\nThese partnerships can help brands innovate in unforeseen ways. Look at the remarkable 2017 collaboration between Louis Vuitton and the Chapman brothers. It resulted in a men\u2019s collection that was a brilliantly subversive take on the gentleman traveler, mixing the brand\u2019s traditional classic luxury with the punk shock of Jake and Dinos Chapman and the wildness of Africa.\nLouis Vuitton is progressive enough to thread artists directly through its innovation and discovery process, engaging them to work from its Paris headquarters on contracts where they help to innovate, stress-test concepts and inject fresh thinking into its process.\nThese deeper collaborations are rich in opportunity for brand and artist alike, but they\u2019re not without risk. It can be tough for artists to know which brand is right to partner with. And it can be just as tough for brand managers to accept the uncertainty that comes with artistic collaboration. How do they find the artist that best represents their brand? And how can one brand create an environment in which art can thrive?\nOne answer is to tap into an established creative community, where artists from different backgrounds and disciplines are already working together\u2014and with brands.\nAndy Warhol\u2019s Factory was a community of artists, muses and anyone Warhol found interesting, but it was also a creative network linking commerce and art.

With a minimum of frills and an impressively large dictionary, this program will shave minutes off writing.\nThis program's interface reminded us of the word-completing software present in text messaging, but still required a visit to the Help file's simple instructions for the basics. While its functionality proved to be initially distracting, we quickly grew to anticipate it. Once we wrote a few letters (for example, \"Arr\") a small screen popped up, providing a list of possible solutions (this example ranged from Arrack, Arrange, Array, and more). We either kept typing our word or scrolled through the choices and chose the correct one. Happily, the word we needed was usually toward the top and required less than a second to pick. The time saved using this program depended heavily on its best feature, an adjustable delay. When we wanted instant help we set no delay, but when we only wanted help if we were stuck on a spelling, we set the program to a longer delay before the screen appeared. No matter how we set it, this was a fantastic option for avoiding the word processor's spelling helper and has the ability to shave minutes from projects.\nTyping Assistant comes with a 21-day trial. This program installs desktop icons without asking permission and leaves Start menu items and folders behind after uninstall.\nTyping Assistant auto-completes your frequently used words and phrases anywhere. It makes typing faster, more intelligent and lowers effort. When typing, a smart Typing Assistant suggestion window opens to show you possible words you are typing. Then with one key stroke it automatically completes the word for you. Typing Assistant automatically learns the words you type, automatically expands user-defined shorthand to full text, automatically accesses clipboard history contents, and automatically launches user-defined application. So that the more you use the program, the smarter it becomes and the more you find it useful. Typing Assistant is the ideal utility for authors, secretaries, journalists, translators, document creators and programmers, in fact anyone who frequently uses a word processor.\n\"One of my most important programs\"\nEase of use. Good dictionaries. Good customer support.\nThis program is one of the most important ones installed on my computer. I am dyslexic, so without an aid, my spelling is horrible.

One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were. Most Libyans agree that peace is a good idea and that the Islamic terrorist groups are most definitely standing in the way. So are tribal and political militias, but these groups have leaders you can negotiate with. Most Islamic terrorist declare they are on a Mission From God and no negotiation is possible. Most Libyans now agree that if you can\u2019t negotiate you can shoot, and the Islamic terrorists respond to that.\nThen there are larger political problems. The Tripoli and Tobruk governments are far apart and represent different groups. The Tobruk government has international recognition and won the 2014 national elections. The Tobruk government is backed by many tribal organizations (and their militias) and most of the more secular Libyans (who tend to live in cities or along the coast). The Tripoli government is backed by groups with more of a religious motivation as well as tribes and cities in the west that feel they deserve to run the country (as they long did under Kaddafi). The Tripoli government does not control all the Islamic terrorist groups that are technically under its command. The only thing the two governments will sometimes agree on is the use of oil income, which the Tobruk government largely controls. This money buys essentials (like food) that are, when possible, distributed to all Libyans. This is what always mattered most because the oil money pays for everything. Unfortunately the two governments have been unable to cooperate on getting oil out and essential supplies delivered to most Libyans. It is the international community that controls the ability of Libya to buy essentials (most of the food and everything else) needed to keep Libyans alive and the international community recognizes the Tobruk government. Because of the violent response to the 2014 elections by Tripoli based Islamic terrorist militias, the legitimate government set up shop in the small port city of Tobruk (1,600 kilometers east of Tripoli) after encountering hostility from militias loyal to the pre-June government that refused to recognize the results of the June elections. Many other government offices moved to Tobruk but many stayed or could not get out in time.\nThe UN is under growing pressure from members to \u201cdo something\u201d about Libya. I n early January Mali and four of its neighbors appealed in the UN for intervention in Libya because southern Libya had become a sanctuary for Islamic terrorist groups that were increasingly active in nearby countries because of those sanctuaries. No one is willing to intervene in Libya but there is UN support for a negotiated settlement and that led to the current peace talks. Some countries, especially Egypt, see Libyan peace talks as futile and counterproductive because the Islamic terrorist factions really have no interest in compromising. Nevertheless Algeria and most Western nations (especially the EU) see a negotiated settlement as the best way to deal with the Libya civil war. The Tobruk government goes along with this, mainly because they cannot afford to annoy the UN and risk losing the international recognition as the legitimate government"}

{"idx": "18348", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Harris \u201cHandy\u201d Gelbard, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Neural Development & Disease at URMC, is slated to receive the Hilary Koprowski Prize in Neurovirology at this year\u2019s International Symposium on Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease at Drexel University. Gelbard will be recognized for developing an unconventional drug that shows promise in treating brain disorders associated with HIV.\nGelbard\u2019s drug, URMC-099, calms the immune system when it goes awry, as happens in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). In HAND, immune reactions to HIV particles in the brain damage nerve cells and cause dementia. Because patients affected by HAND also have HIV, it was imperative that URMC-099 not interfere with the antiretroviral drugs that keep HIV-positive patients alive.\nSurprisingly, when tested in mice, URMC-099 boosted the concentration of a nanoformulated antiretroviral drug, and prolonged its effect, essentially turning the cells into \u201cdrug factories\u201d. The cells began packaging the drug and sending it out to neighboring cells. Gelbard hopes that URMC-099 could make antiretroviral drugs last longer in humans as well \u2013making it possible to reduce the frequency of dosing and increasing compliance.\nThe \u201cselectively non-selective\u201d aspect of URMC-099 is what makes it unconventional \u2013 and effective. Targeting a single molecule at a time is standard pharmaceutical practice that minimizes the risk of drug side effects. URMC-099 targets several molecules at once that are associated with Mixed Lineage Kinases (MLKs), which act like railroad switches in cellular pathways that control stress responses and package viruses.\nURMC-099, and its non-selective nature, beats its selective drug competitors at restoring health in mouse models of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, a high fat and sugar diet induced damage to the liver.\nNot only does this highlight the fact that the unpopular tactic of non-selectivity may be necessary in treating certain diseases, but it also demonstrates the broad applications for this drug. Though URMC-099 has not yet been tested in humans, it shows great promise for both infectious and non-infectious diseases.\nThat is why Drexel University\u2019s Institute of Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease selected Gelbard to receive the Hilary Koprowski prize, named for a world-renowned biomedical researcher.\nKoprowski developed the first successful polio vaccine \u2013 a live vaccine that was utilized effectively abroad, but was never approved for use in the US. His vaccine was soon eclipsed by those of Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Instead, Koprowski gained notoriety for developing a better, less painful rabies vaccine that is used to this day.\nGelbard also recently received the inaugural award of the Translational Research in NeuroVirology Lectureship at the International Society for Neurovirology meetings in 2015."}
{"idx": "18349", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: 'The Square' Is Edgy Swedish writer-director Ruben \u00d6stlund ruthlessly roasts the art community in this loose, leisurely paced series of deadpan vignettes.\nDistressed Swede: In the mordantly satirical The Square, Christian (Claes Bang) curates a contemporary art museum in Sweden.\nLife does not imitate art in Swedish writer-director Ruben \u00d6stlund's The Square. No, something much worse happens: Life imitates conceptual art.\nThe Square is the first Swedish movie to win the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival since 1992's The Best Intentions. That's ironic, since \u00d6stlund's often startling satire is about a man with the best of intentions: a contemporary-art museum director tellingly named Christian (Claes Bang). He's handsome, successful, and, of course, as insensitive and self-centered as the rest of us.\nChristian's next planned exhibition, titled \"The Square,\" will mark off a four-by-four-meter space as \"a sanctuary of trust and caring.\" As Christian prepares for this conceptual monument to empathy and altruism, trust and caring will drain from his life.\nThe galleries Christian supervises hold massive photographs, carefully spaced piles of gravel and a white-neon sign that announces \"You Are Nothing.\" But the future is conceptual and performance art.\nThe museum director is so sure of this that he subjects his wealthiest donors to an assault during a black-tie fundraising dinner. A performance artist (Planet of the Apes motion-capture performer Terry Notary) enters the ballroom in simian mode and displays dominance behavior in an increasingly threatening manner, while his human prey struggle to understand how to respond. It's a surreal confrontation Luis Bunuel would have appreciated.\nThe monkey business ties to one of the script's less successful threads: Christian's one-night stand with an American reporter (Elisabeth Moss) who lives with a never-explained bonobo.\nTheir sexual encounter is a sort of performance that ends with a tiff over one of the props. But the film's central theater piece is a street skit in which Christian is enlisted to help protect a young woman from an attacker. This Oscar-worthy improv turns out to have a classic motivation: When it's over, Christian discovered he's been pickpocketed.\nIn a misguided attempt to retrieve his wallet and phone, Christian paints as thieves all the residents of a lower-income apartment building \u2014 and makes an implacable enemy. He's also so distracted by the personal turmoil that he neglects to supervise the PR agency that's about to post on YouTube a fatuously controversial video to publicize \"The Square.\"\nMultilingual and meandering, The Square is a difficult film that probably won't attract much of an audience in the U.S.. That's partly due to the edginess of its ideas and sensations, but also because of the way they're presented. The movie is an overlong series of loosely connected, leisurely paced vignettes that don't all pay off. Also, \u00d6stlund's wit is sometimes just a little too deadpan.\nFor example: The movie barely announces that it's set in an alternate universe. Christian lives among such recognizable consumer-culture phenomena as 7-11s, Teslas, foodie-ism, and electronic dance music."}

But for many City jobs an integral part of the process is meeting in a social situation, either a meal or a drink in a bar, perhaps with important contacts. It might be tempting to think of these events as jollies, but they are anything but.\n\u201cAccept first that you are being assessed every moment you are with the potential employer and their staff,\u201d says executive coach Jenny Rogers in her book Job Interview Success. \u201cEven if more junior or peripheral staff do not have a formal vote in the process, their opinions will be canvassed.\u201d So how do you deal with the so-called \u201ctrial by canape\u201d?\n1 Remember that you are being watched. If you treat a waiter rudely, people will assume that is how you will treat junior staff. If you order the most expensive thing on the menu, you look like a prima donna. They are assessing both the way you behave socially, which is important in many jobs, but also how you get on with your potential colleagues. This is a \u201cpotentially stressful situation disguised as a social event.\u201d Be an active guest, introduce yourself to people, make small talk and don\u2019t become a liability who the host has to mollycoddle.\n2 Choose your small-talk carefully. By all means moan about London Transport, but avoid stories about arriving in the nick of time \u2013 it hardly inspires confidence about your punctuality. Don\u2019t moan about the venue, the food or the guests \u2013 you will look like a habitual whinger. Don\u2019t spend too much time chatting to other candidates and avoid the temptation to huddle with them \u2013 it might be reassuring, but meeting these people is not the reason that you are there.\n3 Circulate. \u201cDon\u2019t overstay your welcome with one person or group \u2013 the point of the event is to mingle with as many people as possible,\u201d says Rogers. When it\u2019s time to move on, politely shake hands with the person you are chatting to, say it\u2019s been nice to meet them and then move at least a quarter of the room away to speak to somebody else. Be comfortable, enthusiastic and self-confident.\n4 Don\u2019t over-sell yourself. \u201cRemember, these events are not interviews in disguise,\u201d writes Rogers. \u201cTheir purpose is entirely to assess your social skills and to give you a little low-key exposure to some of the people who might be future colleagues.\u201d Do not brag about your skills, give speeches about your qualifications, or be falsely modest. Keep talk about work straightforward and brief, and try to turn things back to a more normal social conversation.\n5 Watch your manners. This is especially important at restaurant events. If you are invited to a one-on-one meal, with your potential boss and their boss, for example, then you are close to landing the job, so don\u2019t sabotage yourself at the last moment. Only order wine if your host does, and restrict yourself to one glass, whatever the host does. Avoid messy food. Be careful how you hold your cutlery \u2013 Rogers says she knows one employer who rejected a candidate because \u201che held his knife like a working class oik\u201d. Afterwards, write a handwritten note saying you enjoyed the meal and reiterating your interest in the job."}

There are a ton of new smartphones in the Rs. 18,000 - 25,000 price range, most with unique features and quite a few touting octa-core processors. Entering the fray is the Sony Xperia M2 Dual, a smartphone which promises good camera performance and long battery life.\nWe put the phone through its paces to find out if it stands true to its claims.\nWe understand that the \"why fix something if it isn't broken?\" ideology is a good enough reason to resist change, but this also deters change - case in point, the \"omnibalance\" design introduced by Sony with the Xperia Z (review), despite its premium look, now feels a little tired. The Sony Xperia M2 Dual gets a bit lost in the crowd of Sony Xperia phones which look just the same. We would have liked for Sony to at least have made a distinction between their own products in different price ranges.\nNevertheless, the Sony Xperia M2 Dual is a good-looking phone with glass on the front and back, and rubberised strips around the edges for better grip. It is not very slim, at 8.6mm, and also weighs 148g making it slightly heavy. Fortunately, it feels good in the hand, and the phone is quite sturdy too. The one thing that is missing here is the waterproofing found in Sony's flagship smartphones.\nOn the left edge of the phone is a microSD card slot protected by a flap, and Micro-USB port. Three physical buttons - power, volume up/down, and camera - are on the right edge along with another long flap covering the slots for two Micro-SIM cards. The top edge has only the 3.5mm jack and the bottom edge is dominated by a long speaker grille.\nThe 4.8-inch LCD screen has a resolution of 540x960, which is very low compared to the HD screens on even a few lower-priced smartphones. While the resolution is low, it's good enough for most tasks. Sunlight legibility is passable but viewing angles suffer due to the highly reflective screen glass.\nJust like the much cheaper Moto G (review), the Sony Xperia M2 Dual has a Snapdragon 400 processor under its hood, clocked at 1.2GHz with an integrated Adreno 305 graphics processing unit. There is 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage space, of which only around 5GB is available to the user. If that feels insufficient, it can be increased by 32GB using a microSD card.\nThe phone accepts two Micro-SIM cards, both of which can connect to 3G networks. They work in dual-standby mode. The front camera has a ridiculously low VGA resolution and can shoot videos only at 480p.

But within the framework of the Israeli political system, the real danger doesn\u2019t come from a head of state who embodies such opinions, but from a coalition that is compelled, in order to maintain its stability, to be extra aggressive against Palestinians and to go to wars.\nIn fact, the most aggressive coalitions in the history of Israel were not the ones led by Likud, by the right wing, but by the so-called center or left, like the Labour Party, which is now calling itself the Zionist Camp. These governments have a right-wing opposition which will never criticize them if they use violence against Palestinians, and therefore they can go much further with their aggressiveness and brutality.\nBut I want to correct you in one small thing. The race between Netanyahu and the Likud and the Zionist Camp was not very close, actually. It was only close in the polls. And then, when we finally get the actual result, we see that there\u2019s quite a significant gap between the two parties. Likud has managed to get several seats in the parliament more than the Zionist Camp. And all of that was a big surprise for the various polling companies.\nPERIES: So then why were the pollings so wrong?\nHEVER: I think many people in Israel have completely underestimated Netanyahu\u2019s skill and his deep understanding of how the political system in Israel works. Netanyahu is the master of short-term solutions, and he doesn\u2019t have or hasn\u2019t expressed any desire to have a long-term strategy to make Israel a better place to live in. But whenever it comes to political crisis, to political crises, he\u2019s the master of getting out of it.\nAnd he has engineered, very, very cleverly, the situation that allowed him to appear as an underdog until the very last moment. In fact, he was the one who called for early election. And many people in the Israeli elite, in the newspapers, have said he\u2019s made a terrible mistake, the public will punish him for calling for an early election, the election costs a lot of money, and they would punish them by voting for the opposition.\nBut Netanyahu understood things much better. He understood that it\u2019s not really an election about personalities. I think a lot of Israelis, probably the majority of Israelis, dislike Netanyahu on a personal level and see him"}

The film that has been marketed as India\u2019s first space film, looks inspired by Hollywood director Michael Bay\u2019s superhit film Armageddon.\nThe trailer of the Tamil film opens with a small asteroid hitting the earth and causing a significant amount of damage to a middle-class residential complex in Chennai. It is a national security issue as the government find out that another rogue asteroid way bigger than the one hit previously is headed straight towards South of India. Soon the top officers of Indian defence department and space scientists contemplate ways to preempt the impending calamity, which is due in seven days. So, they decide to nuke it in the outer space itself.\nGoing by the trailer, we can understand that there is space station with a nuclear missile that can destroy the rogue asteroid. But there is a catch. The in-charge of that space station seems to be in a quarrel with India. So, they enlist the service of a local magician, Jayam Ravi, to go into space and save the lives of millions of Indians. How can a street hustler stop an asteroid? Valid question, and hopefully, director Shakti Soundar Rajan has a convincing answer to it.\nBut, one can\u2019t help wonder, what\u2019s the play here. Is it something like the government wants to send a trickster to outer space, so that he can sneak into the \u201cenemy\u201d space station, and fire the nuclear missile at the falling asteroid?\nEven the special effects of the film seem less appealing by the standards of the space adventures made in the past globally. However, there are a few memorable moments in the trailer that strike a chord. For instance, at the end of the trailer, Jayam Ravi can be seen helplessly floating behind the giant asteroid, which is very close to entering the earth.\nTik Tik Tik, indeed, looks like an ambitious effort from the Tamil filmmakers. But, the trailer doesn\u2019t inspire a tenth of interest and visual shock that Armageddon managed to do nearly 2 decades ago.\nTik Tik Tik trailer: Will Jayam Ravi's ambitious film be as good as Armageddon?"}

Therefore, any object that freezing fog comes into contact with will become coated in ice, often creating stunning landscapes.\nFreezing fog can occur anywhere the air temperature drops below freezing, but it's most common in mountain areas and is most likely to form at night when heat escapes from the atmosphere.\nIn the Western U.S., freezing fog often occurs in mountain valleys and may be referred to as pogonip, a Shoshone word that means \"cloud.\"\nWhen freezing fog occurs, it can cause ice buildup on roads, creating dangerous driving conditions, especially on bridges, which will freeze first because they have no ground insulation.\nBecause freezing fog will freeze on any surface, it often builds up on power lines and can cause power outages.\nFreezing fog differs from ice fog, which is composed of tiny crystals instead of water droplets.

In July, Microsoft said that approximately 184 million commercial PCs still ran Windows 7 worldwide (although the number did not include systems in China, an omission Microsoft did not explain).\nBut Microsoft's number - a tally derived from PC telemetry - was just a fraction of the latest estimate calculated by Computerworld using data from analytics vendor Net Applications. Computerworld's number for August: 378 million Windows 7 business PCs.\nOther forecasts have pegged Windows 7's January 2020 user share at a remarkable 34 per cent, meaning more than a third of all Windows PCs will rely on the then-unsupported operating system.\nWindows 7 ESU, said Spataro, will be available only for PCs running Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Enterprise, and then only if those operating systems were obtained via a volume licensing deal.\nDiscounts will be offered to customers who also have Software Assurance plans in place for Windows or have subscriptions to Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Education, such as the pricy Microsoft 365 subscription.\nThe additional support will be dealt in one-year increments for up to three years and support will be sold on a per-device basis, rather than the per-user approach Microsoft has pushed for Windows 10 licensing.\nPrices \"will increase each year,\" Spataro confirmed. However, Microsoft did not reveal Windows 7 ESU's costs or the exact nature of what would be provided.\nTo confuse matters even more, Microsoft has had a different program, called \"paid supplemental servicing,\" for Windows 10.\nEvidence of that deal, a one-year-and-done paid support plan for Windows 10's feature upgrades, has been scrubbed from the Microsoft's page where it had been touted in February.\nThe omission or demise of paid supplemental servicing was probably due to Microsoft lengthening support for each fall's feature upgrade from 18 to 30 months.\nBased on Spataro's announcement and what Microsoft offers to customers through other plans - notably Windows Server's Extended Security Updates - Windows 7 ESU likely will distribute security patches for vulnerabilities rated as \"Critical\" or \"Important,\" the top two tiers in the firm's four-step ranking system.\nThe price may be steep: ESU for Windows Server 2008 runs 75 per cent of the"}

Pelosi worried that undoing the new rules through the Congressional Review Act would allow internet service providers (ISPs) to package and sell people\u2019s personal browsing data to advertisers.\nCompanies not mentioned in the the letter include Google and Facebook. Both not only make enormous amounts of money connecting ads to consumers, but also contribute financially to Pelosi.\nGoogle is expected to make $72.69 billion in ad revenues in 2017, while Facebook is estimated to make $33.76 billion, according to market research company eMarketer. The two companies combined account for 90 percent of the growth in new ad revenue.\nGoogle and Facebook donated a combined $80,875 to Pelosi through the last three campaign cycles, according to OpenSecrets.org.\nSome argue that the data such private companies like Google and Facebook have is way more detailed and personal than the one\u2019s ISPs can use.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s Gmail system has very good access to personal data \u2014 it sees what you\u2019re telling your friends, business contacts, and family and it knows who your friends are,\u201d Richard Bennett, a tech consultant and one of the original creators of the Wi-Fi system, told The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF). He added that, on the contrary, Gmail is encrypted so ISPs cannot determine what is being said and to whom.\nBennett went on to say that Facebook is similar since, along with Google, they have tracking code embedded in ninety percent of the top 1,000 webs sites, meaning the two companies are able to monitor beyond their own platforms.\nBut the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group, disagrees with Bennett\u2019s contentions, and essentially says the opposite.\nUnlike Pelosi\u2019s letter, the EFF says that it is still worried about Google, Facebook and other services violating people\u2019s privacy.\nISPs and cable companies often claim that the only information they want are related to preferences and tendencies for marketing purposes.\nCompanies are forbidden by the Telecommunications Act to collect and provide data to advertisers that is \u201cindividually identifiable,\u201d or pegged to a certain person.\n\u201cWe do not sell our broadband customers\u2019 individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC\u2019s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so,\u201d said Gerard Lewis, Comcast\u2019s chief privacy officer, according to Reuters.\nPhil Kerpen, a free-market policy analyst and president of a conservative organization called American Commitment, disputes the notion that Democrats like Pelosi voted against the repeal because they wanted to ensure privacy protections.\nSchmidt was spotted wearing a \u201cstaff\u201d badge during Clinton\u2019s election night party.\nAlphabet was also reportedly spearheading the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies that objected to President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban.\nThe final point Pelosi makes in the letter appealing to ISPs and telecomm companies purports that there is a connection between this measure and reports of Russian hacking."}

The recently released Rogue One: The Utimate Visual Guide, written by Lucasfilm Story Group executive and master of canon Pablo Hidalgo, includes a ton of new facts about the Star Wars universe\u2014some cool, some surprising, and some completely messed up.\nMuch as we did for The Force Awakens, we mined the guidebook for all the facts and secrets that didn\u2019t make it on screen... or the prequel novel... or anywhere else. Remember, this is all 100 percent canon. One note, though: Once you discover \u201cThe Decraniated,\u201d Star Wars might never look exactly the same again.\nStar Wars Rebels first introduced \u201cFulcrum\u201d as the codename of ex-Jedi Ahsoka Tano as a secret agent for the burgeoning Rebellion. But \u201cFulcrum\u201d is much more than just Ahsoka\u2014the callsign is a position, not a single person, and it turns out that Rogue One\u2019s Cassian is one such Rebel officer who served in the role. The guide refers to one of Cassian\u2019s operational aliases as being \u201cFulcrum,\u201d a \u201cRecruitment agent in the Albarrio sector.\u201d Given his ties to Rebel Intelligence, presumably Cassian would adopt the name to bring more agents into the wider network of operatives.\nDespite being lead by senators, the Star Wars movies do little to show that the Rebel Alliance is more than a military faction, but it turns out that the Alliance hierarchy has two separate branches: High Command, the military wing of interconnected rebel cells, and the Civil Government, lead by Mon Mothma as its Chief of State and governed by a cabinet of six ministers, former members of the disbanded Imperial Senate.\nWe meet some of those ministers in Rogue One, aside from Mon Mothma and Bail Organa. There\u2019s Senator Nower Jebel of Uyter, the Minister of Finance; Senator Vasp Vaspar of the Taldot sector, the Minister of Industry; and Senator Tynnra Pamlo of Taris (a planet familiar to fans of the beloved Knights of the Old Republic video game series), the Minister of Education. The guide doesn\u2019t specific the final minister.\nOne of the tricky things about prequels is introducing new elements that conveniently then disappear in their successors\u2014and while the Empire has got the convenient excuse of having blown up its Shoretroopers and TIE Strikers on Scarif with the Death Star, the Rebels need a slightly more longwinded explanation for as to why you don\u2019t see U-Wings flying around in the original Star Wars trilogy.\nAs it turns out, there simply weren\u2019t many of them in the first place. Designed by Incom, the same ship manufacturer that created the X-Wing as a potential starfighter for the Imperial Navy, the U-Wing was the corporation\u2019s last starfighter released before it was nationalized by the Empire, and only received a limited production run. Bail Organa managed to snag a few, donating them to the Alliance as a handful of extra support craft. What we see in Rogue One are likely all the U-Wings the Rebellion possessed.\nWhile The Force Awakens introduced the Church of the Force\u2014a religious organization that, while made up of people who weren\u2019t necessarily force sensitive, followed the teachings left behind by the Jedi Order\u2014it turns out there are more Force-based religions floating around on Jedha, even if the Empire frowns upon such spirituality.\n"}

The Unification Ministry later confirmed the remarks.\n\"Purges are continuing in North Korea,\" Ryoo told lawmakers, without saying how he obtained the information.\nThe removal of Jang, which would be the highest-level dismissal since Kim took power two years ago, may indicate that Kim is still trying to solidify his grip on power by dismissing officials who gained prominence under his father Kim Jong Il. In October, Kim replaced his chief of general staff for a third time since taking over the North's 1.2 million-strong army after his father died of a heart attack in 2011.\nJang hasn't been seen since the public execution of two of his confidants last month, South Korea opposition lawmaker Jung Cheong Rae said by phone on Tuesday, citing the South's National Intelligence Service.

Zinke said in a statement later Friday that \"the issuing of permits is being put on hold as the decision is being reviewed.\"\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed on Thursday it lifted the ban. The agency \"determined that the hunting and management programs for African elephants in Zimbabwe and Zambia will enhance the survival of the species in the wild,\" a spokesperson for the agency said.\nThe move would overturn a 2014 rule implemented under the Obama administration that banned hunters from bringing the trophy heads of elephants they'd killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia back to the U.S.\nAnimal rights groups blasted the decision. Conservationists and wildlife advocates were critical of the timing of the move, noting the political turmoil in Zimbabwe, where the military has seized power and had held President Robert Mugabe under house arrest.\nThe Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., called the Fish and Wildlife Service decision to lift the ban \"the wrong move at the wrong time\" and in a statement on Friday called on the Trump administration to withdraw it.\nAnd critics noted that Trump's adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are known big game hunters. Photographs of the pair surfaced in 2012 showing the two men posing with the carcasses of several dead animals from a hunting trip they'd taken a year earlier in Zimbabwe.\nThe reversal of the ban would have applied to dead elephants hunted in Zimbabwe from Jan. 21, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, and to elephants hunted in Zambia in 2016, 2017 and 2018 \"for applications that meet all other applicable permitting requirements,\" a Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said.\nThe agency said that well-regulated sport hunting as part of a management plan can provide local incentives for conservation and raise money for conservation efforts.\nThe African bush elephant is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, but a provision of the law allows for the import of trophies if it can be proved that hunting the animals contributes to conservation efforts.\nThe African savanna elephant population was found to have declined by 30 percent overall between 2007 and 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census in 2016. The population in Zimbabwe was found to have declined 6 percent overall, but some regions in the country reported populations were down as much as 74 percent.\nWayne Pacelle, the CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said on Twitter that he was grateful that Trump was reviewing the decision to lift the trophy ban.\nGrateful to @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump for reassessing elephant and lion trophy hunting imports.

She has received many awards for her acting, including an Academy Award, and has contributed to both national and local philanthropic causes, including the Oxford American, a Southern literary magazine nationally recognized and based right here in Little Rock.\nShe is not some nebulous outsider attempting to sabotage the state.

Based on our resources that we have available, we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can,\u201d Parker said after the hearing.\nThere is no guarantee Haslam will include that amount of funding when he submits his budget to the legislature next year. But the department\u2019s request is a stark contrast to its previous stance on hepatitis C treatment.\nAfter a Tennessean investigation earlier this year found only eight of the 3,487 inmates infected were receiving the medication that could cure the potentially deadly liver disease, the department argued the fact they were drawing blood from infected inmates meant those inmates were receiving treatment. Department spokeswoman Neysa Taylor made the same argument Tuesday morning.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that he asked for $4 million to go toward actual treatment, and that\u2019s wonderful. But we\u2019re talking about around 4,000 people who have hepatitis C\u2026we\u2019re talking about a medical crisis and hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Alexander said Tuesday morning.\nThe Tennessean investigation also found documentation from the department's medical provider indicating hepatitis C had reached epidemic proportions in the state prison system. As Parker notes, many systems throughout the country are battling upticks in hepatitis C cases.\nOnce an extremely difficulty disease to cure, new medications are successful on roughly nine out of 10 patients. But those medicines are expensive: one course of treatment can cost $84,000 or more.\nThe additional funds would \u201cprimarily\u201d go toward the new medication, Parker said. He didn\u2019t say how much the department currently spends on hepatitis C treatment or how many more people it could treat with the additional money. Department officials promised more information later Tuesday.\nHe did say the department also plans to \u201cfocus on risk factors\u201d associated with hepatitis C. Although Parker didn\u2019t reference any factors, hepatitis C is commonly transferred in the prison system through sharing needles, either for drug use or tattoos.\nParker said he couldn\u2019t speak at length about hepatitis C due to a pending lawsuit. In July, two inmates filed a federal lawsuit seeking class action status against the department, asking for all inmates to receive treatment. That case was recently scheduled to go to trial in 2018.\nAlthough $4 million is significantly more than the $600,000 the department requested last year for hepatitis C, the money is a very small part of the department\u2019s budget. The department is in line to receive more than $1 billion in state funds next year. That includes a 2.7 percent pay increase for correctional officers, the amount Parker said was required by law.\nThe department already spends millions every year on drug treatment programs."}

HHS officials insist they have not yet made a decision, saying publicly only that they want to expand alternatives.\n\"This is a pro-life, pro-science administration,\" HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir wrote in mid-November to Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of the House's conservative Freedom Caucus.\nSince President Donald Trump took office, congressional conservatives and anti-abortion activists have ratcheted up pressure on the administration to stop government support of fetal tissue research. They contend that such studies use what they characterize as \"body parts\" from \"unborn babies\" and that alternatives exist.\nThe UCSF research has been a particular target of opponents' ire. Several dozen lawmakers signed a recent letter asking the administration to cut off its funding. And in recent weeks, a columnist for the conservative website, CNSnews.com, wrote repeatedly that the administration had not canceled the contract. The board of the site's parent company, called the Media Research Center, includes conservative Rebekah Mercer, the leader of a family super PAC that poured money into Trump's election.\nThe UCSF contract is the second pot of federal money affected by the conservative crusade. In September, the Food and Drug Administration ended a small, $16,000 contract with a California-based nonprofit, Advanced Bioscience Resources, for fetal tissue that was to be implanted into mice for research into immune responses to drugs.\nThe UCSF contract, slightly more than $2 million per year, was due to expire on Wednesday. The virologist familiar with events said that a contracting official from NIH's AIDS division gave the principal researcher preliminary notice in early October that the government would extend the contract, which began in 2013, for the next year. Government officials confirm that happened.\nThe virologist said the NIH employee \"made it clear it was not an internal NIH decision,\" and said the decision was \"coming from the highest levels.\" The employee, a contracting official representive, also said that the UCSF work was supported within the AIDS division and that staff had spent weeks answering questions about the contract.\nHowever, Lawrence Tabak, NIH's principal deputy director, said in an interview that \"there was never any intention to indicate we intend to terminate the contract.\" After conferring with contracting officials, he said, \"I have no indication such a call was made.\"\nTabak and HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley both said the contract's future will remain uncertain until the administration completes its reconsideration of fetal tissue funding.\nThough it promises federal money through March 5, sections of the letter sound like instructions for an orderly closing of a research enterprise. The letter instructs the investigator to \"finish ongoing studies as planned,\" not to produce new animals for studies and to be ready, if requested later, to return to the government lab animals and equipment."}

It's no benefit since we already have an IFR system that functions without it and a VFR system with the lowest accident rate in history. This is a made up, government mandate where some office bureaucrat made an arbitrary decision. Those of us who have to deal daily with reality of flight and the practicality in ownership are being forced to do so only because \"they say so\". Of course when things are of demonstrably dubious advantage and high cost AND mandated, normal people don't like it.\nAs someone who equipped last year -- because I needed a transponder -- and also did the installation myself, there's something I'd like for your readers to heavily consider as they ponder what equipment to buy. Just the other day, the CFI I do my flight reviews with flew his C172 in for an annual directly from the avionics shop after an upgrade. He did exactly what you described ... had a used 430W installed along with a new 'out' box WITHOUT internal GPS. Right away, he's having issues with the used 430W so the transponder doesn't know where it is. He's squawking Mode S with the transponder but NOT squitting ADS-B under that scenario. He's a frugal fellow and instead of buying a box WITH internal GPS installed, he saved $500 (less, if you consider the same box WITH GPS comes with a GPS antenna which he had to buy). So he switched to his backup radio for comm but now doesn't have ADS-B out working without the 430W working properly. This could happen to anyone who chooses to use position info from another onboard radio. So here's MY two cents worth. If you're going to pop for ADS-B out, DON'T cut corners. Buy a box WITH an internal GPS. That way, you're not dependent upon another radio for position info. IF it goes bad, you're still 'up' to fly in rule airspace as long as the transponder is working and you have a second radio for comm. Folks who fly heavier iron which have two transponders should likely do the same. That way, both boxes have internal position sources totally separate from any other radios in the airplane. The same advice goes for anyone installing a UAT v. transponder. There's another advantage that I discovered during installation which is NOT advertised in any brochures I saw. With the correct software load, the transponder I bought can share its position information with one of those G5 instruments ... thereby saving having to mount another external antenna on the airplane for a certificated installation. Finally, I told the CFI that I'd be able to send him his flight info even though he didn't have ADS-B working because Flight Aware uses multilateration (basically, triangulation via timing) to plot his course over the ground even if ADS-B out isn't working. If you're squawking Mode S (only), your tail number is still visible to ATC and Flight Aware uses this info to construct your flight. His eyes glazed over as I tried to explain it all for him. It was too late to make this recommendation to him but not to make this recommendation to anyone here considering what to do.\nI fly in and around the busy Houston class B airspace, so the decision on whether or not to install was pretty simple.

He even married Jewish, her name is Anna Greenberg (after his marriage to Donna Lynn DePasquale in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic ceremony that ended in divorce). In fact, he is so Jewish, he doesn\u2019t even get the irony of his using anti-Semitic slurs in attacking the most prominent Jewish supporters of President Trump\u2019s pro-White Supremacist comments.\nIt\u2019s not so complicated, really. In a Sunday essay he published, titled \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s three \u2018court Jews\u2019 disgrace themselves,\u201d Milbank reduced three rather admired gentlemen: Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and Jared Kushner, to their most base common denominator: they are Jews.\nSingling out Jews for condemnation based on their ethnic affiliation is as old as ancient Egypt. Of course, Milbank, who prides himself on being unpredictable politically\u2014sometimes he favors Republicans, other times Democrats\u2014didn\u2019t think he was using an ancient anti-Semitic technique. He felt that the fact that these three men with their impressive business record were Jewish compelled them to act one specific way in response to their boss\u2019s views on the Nazis and the rest of the scum from last week\u2019s Charlottesville riots.\nOne of the most blatant forms of racism is to refer to an individual from a particular ethnic group as the representative of his or her entire race. Members of minority groups experience this every day \u2013 for the most part it\u2019s a mild form of racism, borne by the other person\u2019s ignorance. Human beings are just built this way. Occasionally, especially after some dramatic incident, all Blacks become potential looters, all Muslims blow up buildings, all Jews crave money, and, yes, all Japanese Americans are thrown into concentration camps.\nHere\u2019s something from Rabbi Zemel\u2019s Jewish past: after Donald Trump was elected President, Zemel told the Washington Post that he wants to further understanding between liberals and conservatives. He wants to convene very personal conversations \u2014maybe one-on-one, maybe in small groups \u2014 between members of Temple Micah and conservative counterparts, perhaps Trump voters, whom they wouldn\u2019t otherwise meet. He might ask speakers from diverse viewpoints to address the synagogue.\nHere\u2019s a question: how offended would Dana Milbank be if anyone dared criticize his views on, say, Israel on the grounds that he is obligated to think and feel a certain way because he is Jewish, and an influential media Jew to boot? What about when he wrote, in a 2015 column: \u201cWithout two states, there won\u2019t be even one Jewish state if \u2014 God forbid \u2014 my daughter or her progeny someday have no place else to go.\u201d Was that a betrayal of the Jewish dream of a return to our Biblical homeland, which, alas, was more Judea and Samaria than Jaffa and Caesarea? Is it treasonous for Milbank to promote the uprooting of half a million Jews, to make room for the 23rd Arab dictatorship in the Middle East?\nOf course not, because although Milbank\u2019s notions are repugnant, we refute them because they are bereft of facts and are lethal \u2013 not because he is the son of a Jewish mother. Which, incidentally, we\u2019ll have to see some papers for when his daughter or her progeny some day, God forbid, wants to settle here (we\u2019re joking, we love the children of"}
{"idx": "18427", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In the wake of large demonstrations against government manipulation to remove Megawati Sukarnoputri as leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), questions over President Suharto's health have again brought the issue of the presidential succession to the fore. On July 8, Suharto left for Germany to undergo treatment for unspecified kidney, liver and heart complaints.\nSuharto, who is now 75 and serving his sixth presidential term, has for three decades presided over a rigid and authoritarian political system which emphasises \"political stability\" and \"economic development\" at the expense of human rights and political freedoms. Suharto has yet to nominate a successor, and uncertainty over what might happen should he die or be incapacitated sent the Jakarta stock exchange into a spin.\nConflict within the elite has also become sharper, much of it focusing on the presidential succession.\nMinister of information and Suharto crony Harmoko, who is also chair of the state party Golkar, would be able to count on minister of research and technology Habibie, but would receive little support from the military. He also faces a faction headed by Wahono loyalists, whom he ousted from the Golkar leadership in 1993. They would receive parliamentary backing from PDI and sections of the armed forces (ABRI).\nABRI appears divided into two groups, armed forces chief Feisal Tanjung and army chief Hartono, both known as Habibie loyalists, versus the regional military commanders. Habibie, who has the strongest influence with Suharto, has an independent political base in the Islamic Scholars Association and the support of government technocrats.\nConstitutionally, the vice-president, Tri Sutrisno, would automatically become the next president if Suharto died. But few within ABRI consider him capable of leading the country. Harmoko is understood to oppose the automatic accession of the vice-president, and Habibie has stated that the president should be \"mandated\" by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).\nAnother possible contender is retired General Sumitro, who headed the notorious intelligence network Kopkamtib. One of Suharto's political rivals in the 1970s, he is a skilled politician who has retained close links with the military. In recent years he has made a number of public statements supporting cautious reform.\nRegardless of whether he goes on to claim a seventh term in 1998, it is becoming obvious to everyone that a replication of the kind of power wielded by Suharto is impossible. The fundamental problem that faces the regime, therefore, is how to manage an \"orderly\" succession, and how to construct a post-Suharto government which assures a place for them.\nGreater political openness has been forced upon the regime by growing pressure from below and a changing society. At the same time, it has exposed the regime to criticism and demands for deeper reform. The regime has been vacillating between loosening political control and sudden clampdowns while trying to maintain an appearance of ongoing political liberalisation.\nAn illustration of this was the banning of three major news weeklies, Tempo, DeTIK and Editor, in June 1994. The Indonesian press had begun to report issues which not long before would have been considered taboo. But when these publications provided space for other members of the elite to criticise Suharto, they were promptly banned.\nSuharto's political support has also narrowed.

The process of creating a compelling brochure starts with understanding your target market.

Kennedy's assassination has long served as a stark reminder of all that was lost on that day in 1968, and of what American politics might have become had the New York senator survived that turbulent year. Wednesday's 50th anniversary of the tragedy saw a deluge of tributes remembering a man both haunted by history and driven by the vision of an America redeemed.\nEsquire's Charles Pierce this week describes Kennedy as a man uniquely capable of standing against the \"foul gales\" that were then rising in American politics. Pierce believes, as do I, that Kennedy's election to the presidency could have healed a nation pushed to a breaking point by a cacophony of cultural tremors. Despite campaigning against the bleak backdrop of Vietnam, torched American cities, heightened racial tensions and political assassinations, RFK would have stitched together the shredded fabric of American culture and healed the soul of a country that remains, as Pierce writes, \"perpetually redeemable.\"\nIn a new book, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham reminds readers of Franklin D. Roosevelt's belief that for all of this country's failings, the trend of American civilization is forever upward. That is an invaluable reminder during a time when the president proclaims his power unrestrained by Madisonian checks and balances, including ignoring federal subpoenas, killing Justice Department investigations, obstructing justice to protect his personal interests and even pardoning himself. The president's hapless lawyers seem to have convinced Donald Trump, like Richard Nixon before him, that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\"\nBut that twisted interpretation of presidential authority is dead wrong. Even in President Trump's America, no man is above the law.\nIt may come as little relief to those unsettled by the commander in chief's autocratic impulses that this president will likely face the same fate as Nixon if he acts upon his lawyers' ignorant legal opinions. But perhaps take comfort from Meacham's insight in \"The Soul of America\" that \"to know what has come before is to be armed against despair.\"\nHistory does, in fact, show that a president cannot pardon himself. Days before Nixon resigned in 1974, the Justice Department issued an opinion that echoed centuries of American and English law by declaring, \"Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the president cannot pardon himself.\"\nThe history of Bill Clinton's presidency also undermines recent claims from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that Trump is legally entitled as president to ignore a subpoena from Robert Mueller. But do not take my word for it. Read instead Giuliani's own words from 1998. \"You gotta do it. I mean, you don't have a choice,\" the former U.S. attorney said of Clinton's legal options if he received a federal subpoena to testify to Whitewater investigators.\nOther claims of unchecked presidential authority by Trump and his lawyers are so preposterous that they warrant little discussion here. What Time magazine describes as the White House's \"increasingly broad claims of presidential impunity\" would likely be struck down in a unanimous opinion by the Supreme Court. And even Trump's most timid quislings on Capitol Hill would never suggest (like Giuliani) that Trump could have murderedformer FBI director James Comey and escape indictment as long as he was in office.

But it was a good choice in that it gave the SSO the opportunity to play something more firmly in its comfort zone.\nFrom the desiccated, eerie viola theme which opens the work to the raucous razzmatazz of the finale, the orchestra was clearly in its element.\nThe percussion section delivered its parts with the flair, dynamism and brilliance concertgoers have come to expect of it, while Shane Thio was a rock-solid presence on the piano. Whether or not Aya Sakou was equally adept must remain a mystery - from my vantage point in the balcony, her celesta was totally inaudible.\nOnly one person seemed uneasy with all this musical fun: maestro Lubman.

Berkeley that reached a courtroom climax last month, both institutions are duking it out for the right to claim that they invented CRISPR-Cas9, along with the right to reap millions and millions of dollars for licensing their discovery. The patent battle has temporarily slowed scientific research that makes use of CRISPR, in addition to resurfacing a timeworn argument over the place of patents in academic science. But it\u2019s unlikely that any outcome will slow the tide of scientific progress in the longterm. That\u2019s because while CRISPR-Cas9 may still be the buzziest way to edit a genome, a slew of recent discoveries threaten to unseat it as the most efficient. In short: CRISPR-Cas9 is no longer the only game in town.\nCRISPR is a much-hyped genetic engineering technology that hijacks the immune defense of bacteria in order to cut and replace particular stretches of DNA. Although often shortened to CRISPR, it\u2019s actually a two-part system that includes a collection of DNA sequences that make up the CRISPR system and an enzyme that does the actual editing, delivering that DNA to the desired location. The patent battle, which is awaiting a decision by judges, involves the first CRISPR enzyme ever successfully used to edit mammalian genes, Cas9.\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to say that CRISPR will probably change the world. Already it has shown the potential to accomplish feats such as eliminating deadly diseases and protecting natural habitats. But since scientists around the world have already discovered other CRISPR enzymes, who gets credit for the biggest biotechnology innovation of the century may not actually matter all that much.\nWhile CRISPR-Cas9 is often heralded for making gene-editing as simple as \u201ccutting and pasting,\u201d the reality is that it\u2019s nowhere near that precise\u2014and so scientists have gone hunting for alternatives to Cas9. Along the way, they\u2019ve found a few contenders. In 2015, the Broad Institute announced a second CRISPR system, CRISPR-Cpf1, that some suspect may be superior to CRISPR-Cas9 because it is a smaller, simpler enzyme. In May, Chinese researchers published a controversial paper on NgAgo, an entirely new system that they said can also be used to edit mammalian DNA. In June, researchers from several universities announced the discovery of C2c2, a CRISPR enzyme that targets RNA, rather than DNA. And just before Christmas, researchers at Berkeley announced the discovery of two new CRISPR/Cas systems, CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY. Not to mention that there are a host of other ways to edit a genome. That\u2019s a whole lot of potential alternatives to CRISPR-Cas9.\nKevin Noonan, a Chicago patent lawyer with the firm McDonnell, Boehnen, Hulbert & Berghoff, said that the battle over stem cell research is a good bellwether for how the CRISPR patent drama will play out. While a high-profile patent dispute had some worried that stem cell research would stall, in part by requiring companies and some academics to pay licensing fees to"}

They were freed immediately after the plea.\nIn 1994, the men were convicted of killing Steve Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore a year earlier and leaving their naked bodies in a ditch in West Memphis, Ark. Echols was sentenced to death while Misskelley and Baldwin were ordered to spend the rest of their lives in prison.\nAll three of the men have maintained their innocence.\n\"I am innocent of these charges but I am entering an Alford guilty plea,\" Echols told the judge.

Misskelley pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. The Alford plea allows the men to maintain their claims of innocence.\nEchols' wife, Lorri, sat in the front row of a crowded courtroom, next to Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who became a key supporter of the men after watching a pair of HBO documentaries about the case. Vedder put his arm around her during the proceedings.\nPolice had few leads until receiving a tip that Echols had been seen mud-covered the night the boys disappeared. The big break came when Misskelley unexpectedly confessed and implicated Baldwin and Echols in the killings. Defense attorneys claim police took advantage of his low IQ.\nLast fall, the three men won new hearings from the Arkansas Supreme Court which was more than 15 years after they went to prison despite little physical evidence linking them to the crime scene. Their attorneys point to new DNA evidence that they say should help exonerate the three men.\nWhen asked about the plea Echols told reporters, \"It's not perfect, not perfect by any means,\" reports CBS affiliate KTHV.\nHe says they can still follow and bring up evidence to prove their innocence and now from the outside.

This dynamic has already helped Tesla and China's Nio steal a march on much larger rivals in the premium electric sportscar segment.\n\"Large companies take time to transform. And I am good at hypercars. I just did Project One, and now this opportunity came,\" 37-year-old Wollmann told Reuters about his reason for joining Automobili Pininfarina, a Munich-based electric carmaker that launched last year.\nPremium or high-performance electric sports cars are equivalent to the Ferraris and Lamborghinis of the conventional auto world. These so-called supercars can cost anything from about $100,000 up into the millions of dollars and include Tesla's upcoming Roadster Founder Series, which will sell for over $200,000 and the Rimac Concept Two, priced in the region of $2 million.\nPlayers leading the way include the likes of Automobili Pininfarina, Croatia's Rimac, China's Nio and Italian engineering shop Italy's Maniffatura Automobili Torino (MAT).\nWollmann was hired because he also helped develop an electric version of the AMG SLS for AMG Mercedes, a skill that will help Automobili Pininfarina, owned by India's Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, develop its own zero-emissions vehicle.\n\"I did the first electric hypercar for AMG so this was the perfect fit,\" he said.\nSince its 2018 launch, Automobili Pininfarina has hired a raft of top-flight German engineers. Christian Jung, Porsche's chief engineer of E-Mobility systems, and Peter Tutzer, a former technical director at supercar brand Bugatti, are part of the team.\nThey are designing the \"Battista\", an electric supercar with a top speed of at least 300 km an hour (186 mph) and acceleration from 0 to 100 in under two seconds. Around 150 will be built, costing 2 million pounds each, the company said.\n\"Rene Wollmann came to us because he said it was difficult to realise projects like these at a large company,\" Michael Perschke, Automobili Pininfarina's Chief Executive told Reuters.\nAnother start-up electric carmaker, Rimac, will provide the Battista's electric motor and battery pack.\n\"Powertrains with 700 kilowatts of capacity are"}

It's not hard to see why. Services, which includes \"revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services,\" is Apple's second-largest segment by revenue (behind the iPhone).\nMore importantly, services are becoming a larger part of Apple's overall revenue mix over time, and that should bode well for Apple's bottom line. In the most recent quarter, the segment made up 17.9% of sales, up from 16% in the year-ago quarter. As this growth continues, services performance will continue to increase the company's margins, according to comments made by company CFO Luca Maestri.\nOne service that has been quite successful for Apple has been its mobile payments service, Apple Pay. On the company's July 31 earnings call, management shared some encouraging information about Apple Pay that investors might want to pay attention to. Let's dive in.\n\"Well over 1 billion\" Apple Pay transactions occurred during the June quarter-- tripling the number of transactions that took place in the same period a year ago.\n\"To put this tremendous growth in perspective, this past quarter we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook explained.\nThe momentum doesn't seem to be slowing, either. Cook further disclosed that the rate of growth in Apple Pay transactions during the June quarter accelerated from what the company saw in the prior quarter.\nApple receives a small percentage of the value of each transaction made with Apple Pay, so this growth in transaction volume goes directly to the company's bottom line.\nPer Cook, Apple Pay \"is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4900 bank partners,\" and the company is looking to bring Apple Pay to the German market \"later this year.\"\nBeyond just adding new markets to the mix, Apple is working to expand Apple Pay acceptance.\n\"In the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-Eleven will roll-out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall,\" Cook explained.\nThe idea here is simple: The more places that Apple's customers can use Apple Pay, the more transactions each customer is likely to make using the service, potentially driving revenue and profit growth for its services business.\nCook called out transit as \"another important area of growth\" and told investors that \"Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas.\"\nBack in December of 2017 with the introduction of iOS 11.2, Apple augmented Apple Pay with the capability to \"send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily, and securely.\"\n\"Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch,\" Cook asserted. This is a good start, but Apple must continue to work to bring Apple Pay to other markets. Just over half of Apple's total revenue comes from outside North America, so to really move the needle, Apple must seek out markets outside the United States.\nApple's services business continues to be an impressive source of revenue growth for the company, and within Services, Apple Pay appears to be doing quite well. The company is making the right moves by bringing Apple Pay to new regions and more locations. New feature"}

For 2.5 years, Snapchat foolishly tried to take the high road versus Facebook, with Spiegel claiming \u201cOur values are hard to copy.\u201d That inaction allowed Zuckerberg to accrue more than 1 billion daily Stories users across Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook compared to Snapchat\u2019s 186 million total daily users. Meanwhile, the whole tech industry scrambled to build knock-offs of Snap\u2019s vision of an ephemeral, visual future.\nBut Snapchat\u2019s new strategy is a rallying call for the rest of the social web that\u2019s scared of being squashed beneath Facebook\u2019s boot. It rearranges the adage of \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d into \u201cto beat them, join us.\u201d As a unified front, Snap\u2019s partners get the infrastructure they need to focus on what differentiates them, while Snapchat gains the reach and entrenchment necessary to weather the war.\nSnapchat\u2019s plan is to let other apps embed the best parts of it rather than building their own half-rate copies.\nWhy reinvent the wheel of Stories, Bitmoji and ads when you can reuse the original? A high-ranking Snap executive told me on background that this is indeed the strategy. If it\u2019s going to invent these products, and others want something similar, it\u2019s smarter to enable and partly control the Snapchatification than to try to ignore it. Otherwise, Facebook might be the one to platform-tize what Snap inspired everyone to want.\nThe \u201cCamera company\u201d corrected course and took back control of its destiny this week at its first-ever Snap Partner Summit in its hometown of Los Angeles. Now it\u2019s a camera platform thanks to Snap Kit. Its new Story Kit will implant Snapchat Stories into other apps later this year. They can display a more traditional carousel of your friends\u2019 Stories, or lace them into their app in a custom format. Houseparty\u2019s Stories carousel shares what your buddies are up to outside of the group video chat app. Tinder will let you show off your Snapchat Story alongside your photos to seduce potential matches. But the camera stays inside Snapchat, with new options to share out to these App Stories.\nThis is how Snapchat colonizes the native app ecosystem similarly to how Facebook invaded the web with the Like button. Snap\u2019s strong privacy record makes these partners willing to host it where now they might fear that Facebook and its history with Cambridge Analytica could tarnish their brand.\nInstead of watching these other apps spin up mini competitors that further fragment the Stories world, Snap saves developers the slow and costly hassle while instantly giving them best-in-class tools to boost their own engagement. Each outpost makes your Snapchat account a little more indispensable, grants its camera new utility and reminds you to visit again. It\u2019s another reason to stick with Snap rather than straying to other versions of Stories.\nIf Spiegel knows what\u2019s up, he\u2019ll douse the Story Kit partnerships team with resources so they can sign up as many apps as possible before Facebook can copy this idea too. For now, Snap isn\u2019t injecting ads into App Stories, but it could easily do so and split the cash with its host. This would attract partners, generate revenue and give Snap\u2019s advertisers more reach.\nEither way, Snap will score those benefits with its new Ad Kit. Later this year the Snapchat Aud"}

Apple has cut out the middleman with this new feature, which if you attach a file that is too large to send by conventional means will be automatically uploaded to your iCloud account (up to 5GB).\nIf the receiver is also using one of Apple's mail clients, they will be able to download it as if it were a normal attachment - and if not, they will instead see a weblink they can hit to go and download the file. Just like Dropbox.\n- and the 9.2 upgrade brings the same functionality to iOS.\nBetter late than never, Apple has figured out how to best make use of 3D Touch in its ereader app. Obviously for it to work you'll need an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus.\nUsing 3D Touch, you can \u201cpeek\u201d and \u201cpop\u201d pages in a book from a table of contents, your notes, bookmarks or search results inside a book.

Should the air contain a biological hazard, the antibodies become active, changing the electrical properties of the plate and triggering an alarm.\nAt present, most mobile detection units are the site of a large van so something that could be carried by a soldier would be a real advantage.\nAnother UGV, this is a robot scout designed to examine hostile areas from a safe distance.

The pipeline, owned by ExxonMobil, had been built in the 1940s, and was known to be prone to cracking down along the lengthwise seams. Independent laboratory tests conducted after the spill found that the pipeline had been defective since it had first been laid more than 70 years before the incident.\nIn 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency fined Exxon $3.19 million in federal civil penalties, due to Clean Water Act violations stemming from the pipeline spill. Exxon also agreed to pay $1 million in state civil penalties, as well as an additional $600,000 to a project aimed at restoring water health in Lake Conway, which had been impacted by the spill.\nSeparately, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) fined Exxon $2.6 million for nine probable violations of safety rules that lead to the spill, including failing to adequately account for risks posed by the pipeline.\nPipeline spills, while less common than spills from other types of fossil fuel transportation like oil trains, occur with stunning frequency throughout the United States. According to PHMSA, between 2008 and 2012, U.S. pipelines spilled over 3.1 million gallons; and while pipeline spills occur less frequently than oil train spills, pipelines often release much more oil into the surrounding environment when they do spill. Data from the Center for Biological Diversity shows that North Dakota alone has averaged four pipeline spills a year since 1996, which in turn has cost the state some $40 million in property damage.\nCanadian tar sands oil, the type of oil spilled by Exxon in Mayflower, is especially pernicious when released into the environment. Tar sands oil is extremely thick, so to get it to flow through pipelines, oil companies have to dilute it with natural gas liquids to create something called diluted bitumen, or dilbit. When dilbit spills, the natural gas \u2014 a volatile compound \u2014 vaporizes, drifting into nearby neighborhoods and causing the kinds of health problems that forced the residential evacuation in Mayflower. The tar sands bitumen, however, once again becomes incredibly thick and heavy, almost instantly sinking to the bottom of any body of water in which it has been released. As a result, traditional methods of cleaning waterways after oil spills, like skimming the top of water to remove the fuel, don\u2019t work for oil spill cleanup.\nDilbit is the same kind of oil that was released during Enbridge\u2019s 2010 pipeline spill in Michigan, which resulted in some 1 million gallons of tar sands being released into the Kalamazoo River. And dilbit is the same kind of fuel that would flow through the Keystone XL pipeline, which is currently under consideration by Nebraska state regulators after being given the green light by the Trump administration.\nThe same"}

The other short odds to win are Dustin Johnson (11/1) and Jason Day (16/1). This event takes place today-Sunday from TPC Four Season Las Colinas.\nJordan Spieth is the clear favorite for a reason. He is playing in his home state, which has been a pretty good sign for him to play well. He finished second last week in Texas and he has won or finished second in five of his last eight tournaments. Expect another strong showing this weekend.\nJason Day is a former champion of this event and he has four top 10s in 2015. Day has 16/1 odds this weekend, which we think is a smart play for someone of his caliber and consistency. Day seems to step up the stronger the field is. Look for that to continue this weekend.\nZach Johnson is at 28/1 to win this weekend. He has had three straight top-20 outings and has done the same in six of his last seven tournament. Johnson is on a nice kick and we think his 28/1 odds makes him a very solid play. Look for Johnson to be in contention come Sunday."}

{"idx": "18472", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Brown finds the ball, reacts, and finishes through the ball carrier. His speed is without a doubt his strongest asset and the key to his game. Brown is a natural mover, and his strength isn't compensated by his play speed, as he is well-polished in removing himself from blocks and getting to the ball. He is strong over the tight end and has the footwork and hip mobility to run with any tight end in coverage. There are few running backs even at the NFL level who can outrun Brown and get an edge in the run game, and few will slip open against him in the pass game. While he excels out in space, he is also able to play in the box and sniff out runs as a gap defender and make explosive plays at the point of attack. He uses his pure athletic ability and speed to dip and run by linemen into the backfield. Brown also displays the power to run through running backs both in protection and carrying the ball. He is a productive tackler and rarely falls off the ball once getting there, making it likely he will continue that high-volume production for years to come.\nLike his fellow Tar Heels with first-round potential, there are questions surrounding other aspects of Brown's game and life. He has shown a tendency to disappear for long stretches and will need to be reeled in while sticking to the playbook at the next level to assure that he is playing to his potential. While Brown could stand to put on some weight, there are very few things that Brown needs to do physically to mold his game for the next level; many of the changes revolve around his work habits."}

We are interested in proposals for courses that are broadly related to this theme, as well as in any area of linguistics (including those unrelated to the theme).\nWe are particularly interested in proposals for clusters of courses that relate to one another, especially when taught by a group of scholars interested in using the Institute to pursue collaborative research projects.\nFor the instructors of accepted courses, the Institute will cover the costs of travel, housing, and will provide a small honorarium. Proposals to co-teach courses are welcome, including proposals that split courses between two instructors. For co-taught courses, expenses will be paid for both instructors but the honorarium will be divided between the instructors.\nProposals will be evaluated by the course review committee. On the basis of the proposal evaluations, the LSA 2019 Institute Steering Committee will make a final selection of courses that ensures a coherent, well-balanced curriculum.\nA brief statement of any synergistic activities related to the course should also be included. This might include (among other possibilities): collaborators teaching (or proposing) other courses, relationship of the course to workshops or other events held at the LSA annual meeting, and so on. We encourage all proposals to explore synergies with the LSA annual meetings (both before and after the Institute) to enhance the continuity of the projects. We also encourage those proposing to teach a course to consider becoming members of the LSA (if you are not already or are a lapsed member).\nProposals should avoid overlap with\u202fcourses already planned for the 2019 Institute (see http://lsa2019.ucdavis.edu/courses/ for a tentative list of invited courses).\nThe deadline for receipt of course proposals is April 1, 2018.

Virgin Galactic's first vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, ripped apart in mid-air, killing a co-pilot.\nStucky spoke to CNN Business after Thursday's successful firing of the rebuilt SpaceShipTwo, called VSS Unity, to record heights at nearly three times the speed of sound. He said it was like taking a thoroughbred racehorse into a full gallop for the first time.\n\"Before you can race her you have to train and walk her down uneven terrain, but eventually you have to say, maybe I should race her,\" he said. \"That's what Unity reminded me of.\"\nThe test flight was the first time Brason's space tourism startup has gone more than 50 miles above Earth. It earned both pilots commercial astronaut wings from the US government and put Virgin Galactic on track to become the first private company in the world to take paying customers to space.\nVirgin Galactic had worked toward the goal since it was founded in 2004. It also marked the first crewed flight to space from US soil since the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, with Virgin Galactic beating out other well-funded competitors.\nThe company is squared up to compete directly with Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin to conduct suborbital tourism flights.

The pilots had the option to cut the engine burn short, which they would have been forced to do if any of the safety checks were abnormal or weather turned bad.\nThe pair tried to do everything possible to boost their chances of success. The morning before flight, Stucky and Sturckow met at Virgin Galactic's Mojave hangar at 4:30 am to run through flight simulations meant to mimic any possible curve ball the day could throw their way.\n\"We did it again, and again, and again, and got it perfectly,\" Stucky said.\nDespite a rough windshear, VSS Unity's engine roared for 60 seconds and reached Mach 2.9.

This may vary slightly depending on the school district your child will be attending. For the 2015-16 school years, most districts are beginning school on or about the 13th of August.\nQ: How old must a child be to start school?\nA child is eligible for admission to kindergarten/first grade if the child is a military dependent and has successfully completed an accredited pre-kindergarten program or has attended an accredited kindergarten program in another state.\nA child who reaches the age of five (5) prior to the cut-off date is eligible for admission to the summer school session immediately preceding kindergarten.\nA child is eligible for admission to first grade if the child reaches the age of six (6) before the first day of August of the school year beginning in that calendar year.\nAny child who completes the kindergarten year shall not be required to meet the age requirements of a district for entrance into grade one.\" This law does not specify the type of kindergarten program that must be completed prior to promotion to the first grade. Most school districts accept successful completion of kindergarten at any accredited public, private or parochial school as sufficient basis for promotion to the first grade. A child transferring from an unaccredited school, such as a home school, may be subject to additional evaluation to determine promotion.\nQ: What are the Missouri State Vaccine Requirements?\nA: The requirements are different depending on the age of your child. The National Vaccine Information Center will give you current general information, vaccination requirements, and exemption information for religious & medical reasons.\nQ: Which schools do most of the installation children attend?\nA: The rule of thumb for the school districts surrounding our area is that a student will walk to school if they live within one mile of the school they are attending. There are many exemptions for this rule based on age & special needs of the student so it is best to call the school district directly for more information.\nAll students living on base attending Knob Noster Middle School and Knob Noster High School ride the bus into Knob Noster.

Microsoft and Samsung round out the top five.\nThe rising importance of digital technology continues to be an overarching megatrend for innovators. In particular, BCG's new report, The Most Innovative Companies 2019: The Rise of AI, Platforms, and Ecosystems, finds that innovators are increasingly embracing AI as a way to develop new products and services and improve internal innovation. In addition, innovators are embracing technology platforms and their cousin, ecosystems, to tap into sources of external innovation and differentiation.\n\"Digital technology and external innovation have become watchwords,\" said Ram\u00f3n Baeza, a BCG senior partner and report coauthor. \"All of the top ten companies\u2014and many in the top 50\u2014use AI, platforms, and ecosystems to enable themselves and others to pursue new products, services, and ways of working.\"\nA skills gap is evident withrespect to AI.

Among AI leaders, 94% see AI as important to their organizations' future growth, versus 56% of AI laggards (respondents who rate their organization's AI capabilities as below average).\n\"AI will have a significant impact on business processes, but its biggest potential lies in developing new products and services that can yield major revenue streams over time,\" said Michael Ringel, a BCG senior partner and report coauthor. \"AI leaders are already blazing a trail,\" he said, noting that leaders reported much higher percentages of sales driven by AI-enhanced products or services introduced in the past three years.\nThis year's report shows organizations increasingly looking beyond their own walls for new ideas.

Comic Relief has raised over \u00a31bn for many incredibly deserving causes, something I wholeheartedly support and feel proud to be associated with. I am, however, writing this before the show, so it\u2019s possible I will make a career-ending error, in which case; goodbye.\nMy take on the Stacey Dooley incident, if anybody needs another one, is this: it was naive. Dooley has made some excellent and challenging television, and went to Africa with the best of intentions. The photograph of her holding a young boy was, however, taken without proper consideration of what that imagery signifies for people of African descent. It can\u2019t be denied that fundraising and televised charity have led to the stereotyping of African countries as disease-ridden poverty zones. Swooping in and picking up kids for photo opportunities is, at best, insensitive. I may not completely agree with David Lammy, because the direct result could well be that fewer people made donations. But his central argument \u2013 that these photos promote a stereotype that has been reinforced by charity work of this nature \u2013 echoes concerns that many people have had for a long time.\nI went to Ethiopia last year and was shown around by a local, Mike, who found it simultaneously amusing and frustrating that a three-year famine that had occurred before his lifetime had led to his country for ever being defined as a charity case. Nearly 35 years after Band Aid, visitors still commented in surprise at the level of infrastructure and abundance of food. Nobody is denying parts of Africa need help; but if this publicity is not balanced with coverage of the continent\u2019s more successful side, can you blame the British public for having a skewed perspective?\nSocial media is not a great place for debate, but even for the internet, some of the arguments defending Comic Relief were depressing: \u201cSaying a white person can\u2019t pick up a black child and take a photo is racist. You wouldn\u2019t say that if it was the other way round.\u201d I am not of the school of belief that racism cannot be experienced by white people, but the argument that the reversal of ethnicities is an equivalence is so flawed I cannot bring myself to engage with it.\nThe obvious question is: why does it have to be this way? Part of the answer is that we are desensitised to the needs of those less fortunate. We are only motivated to donate money by simple, unnuanced images and causes. Of course Comic Relief doesn\u2019t just give money to that kid with flies all over him. There are many complex issues they engage with, but these are not easily explained and do not encourage the public to reach into their pockets and help. Think I\u2019m being harsh? Remember there are people in the UK who dismissed the Syrian refugee crisis because they saw photos of some of them with mobile phones. Comic Relief has the difficult job of motivating an increasingly indifferent nation, and that means losing a bit of nuance.\nI myself introduced a video about a family describing their son\u2019s suicide, particularly poignant for me as a close friend took his own life last year. I found it challenging to watch, but it certainly inspires you to do what you can to help. I\u2019m not saying this excuses the \u201cwhite saviour\u201d phenomenon, or the \u201cAfrican poverty\u201d narrative.

Brownstein, a researcher at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who develops technologies that track and promote public health.\n\u201cThe concept of bringing on-demand services . . . bringing physicians and nurses to people has so many opportunities,\u201d Brownstein said. Startup companies are enabling people to order home visits from medical professionals, he said. For example, PediaQ , available in four Texas communities, provides an app parents can use to summon a pediatric nurse practitioner to their homes during evenings and weekends.\nThe Uber project is an outgrowth of Brownstein\u2019s HealthMap Vaccine Finder, a website that provides a list of recommended vaccines, tailored to the individual, and locations nearby where the vaccine can be obtained.\nBut no matter how easy it gets, most healthy young adults can\u2019t be bothered getting a flu shot, with only 30 percent of 18- to 49-year-olds getting vaccinated.\nThat\u2019s why Brownstein said he contacted Uber, the ride-hailing service, last year with what might have been regarded as a wacky idea: How about inviting people to call Uber drivers who have a nurse and box of flu vaccines in the back seat?\nLang held one of the influenze vaccination kits that she used to vaccinate patients.\nUber, he said, was receptive from the start, and tested the program in Boston, Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C., last year.\nThe demand proved greater than the supply of vaccine, and many customers were disappointed, Brownstein said. Still, more than 2,000 got vaccinated in that 2014 pilot. In a survey afterward, 78 percent of respondents said having the vaccine delivered was important to their decision to get the shot.\nOn Thursday, Uber expanded the one-day flu-shot program to 36 cities, including Philadelphia, Houston, Des Moines, and Los Angeles, where the service was available from 11 a.m to 3 p.m. Thursday. It was offered only for a short time because of limited resources and the need to gauge patient demand, Brownstein said. Uber declined to say whether it would offer the service again.\nDr. Anita Barry, director of the Infectious Disease Bureau at the Boston Public Health Commission, welcomed the Uber project to Boston. \u201cThe more people we get vaccinated against influenza, the better off we all are,\u201d she said.\nThe \u201cwellness pack\u201d is a bag with trinkets such as hand sanitizer and a water bottle. When someone clicked to order it, the driver receiving the request gave the information to a nurse, who called to confirm the request and ask if the customer also wanted a flu shot.\nUpon arrival, the driver waited in the car, while the nurse went inside to handle paperwork and administer the shot at no additional charge.

{"idx": "18507", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: For a simple rock-head like myself, cellulose is made of \u201chard nuggets\u201d that are derived from sugar. One way to make liquid fuel out of cellulose is to use microbes that break down the \u201cnuggets\u201d to the sugars within them -- material that then can be fermented into ethanol and burned as fuel. There are details yet to be worked out, but I think you\u2019ll soon see the day that genetically modified microbes will be used to convert cellulose to ethanol in roughly economic terms.\nLignin is the other material in trees. If you\u2019re reading this column in a newspaper, you\u2019re holding a lot of lignin in your hands. Lignin turns yellow with time when it\u2019s exposed to air -- a feature of old newspapers you\u2019ve doubtless noticed.\nLignin gets in the way of processing cellulose for biofuel. Lignin and cellulose are both natural parts of the cells in trees, and we cannot simply eliminate lignin in a pine tree. But the day may come when we use biotechnology to manipulate the lignin/cellulose partnership to suit our purposes when the tree is harvested.\nThis is just one example of the fact that biotechnology -- the art of manipulating the living world at the level of the gene and the cell -- is the quiet revolution that\u2019s going on all around us. Biotechnology is not as obvious to consumers as the internet or cell phones, but biotech is reshaping the fundamentals of our world at a pace that will only increase.\nTrees could also yield biofuels in quite a different way. Think for a moment of school lessons about rubber trees in the tropics. Many of us who live in northern climates vaguely remember being taught about rubber trees, but we don\u2019t know that other tropical trees produce sap that\u2019s similar to kerosene and diesel fuel.\nThat sounds odd, I know, but it\u2019s just a fact some tropical trees naturally produce liquid hydrocarbon fuel. What\u2019s not to like about that?\nThe best \u201cdiesel tree\u201d produces about 10 gallons per year of biodiesel fuel. And that\u2019s led some farmers in the tropical part of Australia to plant 20,000 of the diesel trees for later tapping.\nNow, mind you, the quantities produced by diesel trees are small compared to what us geologists rip out of the Earth in oil fields. Ten gallons per year is not exactly a flood of biblical proportions. Still, it\u2019s liquid fuel harvested directly from trees -- quite a feat.\nHere in the continental U.S. we don\u2019t have the climate for diesel trees. But some of our trees, such as the Western red cedar, do have significant amounts of heartwood chemicals in them to provide interest for our energy concerns. Using biotechnology once again, we may be able to \u201cimprove\u201d such trees from the point of view of biofuel production.\nProfessor Norman Lewis of Washington State University recently gave me an overview of this whole realm of bioengineering. Everything from the lignin and cellulose divisions in plants to the possible hydrocarbon content of tree heartwoods is up for research these days.\nIf we can find ways to better utilize Earth\u2019s largest plants to produce more fuel, even us hard-core geologists will become tree-huggers."}

{"idx": "18509", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: May speech: Last ditch attempt to improve position before business end of talks begins.\nSo here we are again. Another Brexit speech from the prime minister, another inch further down the road to nowhere. Her glacial transformation from fairy tale to economic disaster continues. Watching her over the last 18 months has been like seeing a children's animation turn into a bleak kitchen sink drama. She began with gusto and passion, promising that Britain could have all the trade it wanted - \"the exact same benefits\", to use David Davis' phrase, outside the single market and customs union as inside. Britain would call the shots, because it buys cars. We wouldn't pay any money to Europe and would walk out if they kept insisting on it.\nThen slowly the compromises came. The Florence speech saw her repeat, almost word-for-word, Brussel's requirements on the budget, like a hostage reading out a statement written by their kidnapper. That kept talks on the road. This time she was faced with the universal calls for clarity on her position, which now came from three directions - Brussels, the hard Brexiters and the Remainers. A pretty formidable coalition, united at last in their desire to know what the hell was going on.\nThe choice is simple. If Britain keeps all its control it must give up its trade. But if it wants to keep all its trade, it must lose some control. This is not because Brussels is mean or vengeful. It is because it facilitates open borders on the basis that they are all part of the same legal system, with the same monitoring and enforcement bodies operating amid the same institutions. The UK is leaving those arrangements and consequences follow from that. At the moment, Britain looks like a teenager telling his parents he is leaving the house, but still demanding they drive over and cook his meals.\nRhetorically at least there was some improvement. May said the border in Ireland must stay completely open - a welcome confirmation given Boris Johnson's now stated views to the contrary. She admitted that there would be a loss of access to the single market due to her policies. She accepted that the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which she foolishly made a red line in late 2016, would probably still have a role in British law. Her criticisms of the EU were often fair. She was right to say, for instance, that they should not be demanding the regulatory standards of a Norway deal while offering the benefits of a Canada one. She will have earned some points for signing up to EU rules on state aid - although made the likelihood of a Labour rebellion on the final deal more likely.\nAnd she did bring clarity. It's just that it wasn't on the choice between trade and control. It was clarity on her own fantasy about not having to make the choice.\nYes, she has given up on the idea that you can have your cake and eat it. But she still believes that she can take all the chocolate off the other slices and put it on hers, only for the EU to smile magnanimously and offer her some more helpings.\nIt is a nonsense. It is not going to happen. May is pedaling furiously now, but it is down a path which everyone has already warned her leads to a dead end.\nHer Florence plan was for three baskets. There would be one part of the economy where the UK would harmonise its regulations with the EU. Another part would align, so that it had the same standards but reached them in its own way. And a third part would diverge. Harmonisation was for things like aviation and chemicals, where the UK would seek associate membership of EU agencies. Alignment was for goods, where regulatory standards would"}

He claimed they belonged to his wife Sally, a Labour activist.\nThe Speaker advised Labour on how to undermine the Brexit deal, even dragging the Queen into things by means of an arcane constitutional device called the \u201chumble address\u201d.\nWhen the Prime Minister faced questions on the Brexit deal in December, it took a full hour for the Speaker to call one of the MPs who supported it.\nHe broke with constitutional precedent to permit the Tory uber-Remainer Dominic Grieve to put down an amendment on a bill the Government had been reassured could not be amended.\nAnd last week he refused to put forward an amendment supported by 127 MPs, from multiple parties, ruling out a second referendum.\nHe simultaneously accepted amendments with far less backing which sought to thwart Brexit in one way or another.\nAlthough elected to Parliament as a vehemently right-wing \u201chang \u2019em and flog \u2019em\u201d type, Bercow swung towards the Left in the 2000s. Even though his views changed, his monumental self-regard remained.\nHe was elected Speaker thanks to a Labour bloc vote and has assiduously courted its support.\nRecently he signed a Freedom of Information exemption to stop Newsnight investigating the alleged misbehaviour of Keith Vaz, one of Westminster\u2019s sleaziest MPs, on foreign trips.\nFor his own Tory colleagues, he often shows little but contempt.

Use the U.S. News Best Price Program to find the best local prices on the Passport.\nThe 2019 Honda Passport ranked #1 in Midsize SUVs. Currently the Honda Passport has a score of 8.8 out of 10 which is based on our evaluation of 11 pieces of research and data elements using various sources.\nThe Honda Passport, back for 2019 after a long time away, ranks near the top of the midsize SUV class. It is capable on- and off-road, and its roomy cabin, large cargo hold, and abundance of safety features help raise its appeal.\nIs the Honda Passport a Good SUV?\nThe new Passport is a great midsize SUV. It offers a generous amount of passenger and cargo space for a two-row SUV. It also has a well-built cabin, lots of standard safety features, and a potent V6 engine. It aims for the sweet spot between the on-road comfort of rivals like the Ford Edge and the off-road prowess of the Jeep Grand Cherokee. While it lands more on the comfort side, it does have some light off-roading capabilities. All in all, the Passport is a well-rounded vehicle.\nShould I Buy the Honda Passport?\nThe 2019 Passport is a comfortable, spacious midsize SUV that\u2019s great to drive on the trails, around town, and on the freeway. However, this is a highly competitive segment, and many rivals offer some appealing traits of their own. The Honda Pilot is basically a Passport with three rows and less off-road capability. For an even more proficient off-roader, consider the Jeep Grand Cherokee or Toyota 4Runner.\nShould I Buy a New or Used Honda Passport?\nHonda reintroduced the Passport for the 2019 model year after discontinuing it in the 1990s. This model is drastically different than those older models. There are no recent Passports that are comparable on the used market.\nOur goal is to provide you with the information you need to make car shopping a breeze. You'll find everything you need to know about this vehicle in our comprehensive Honda Passport review. It combines concrete data (like fuel economy estimates and cargo space dimensions) with professional evaluations from 11 automotive sources.\nHow Much Does the Honda Passport Cost?\nThe base Honda Passport Sport has an MSRP of $31,990. That\u2019s above average among midsize SUVs. The top-of-the-line Elite trim starts at $43,680, which is a little less than the high-end trims of many rivals.\nWhich Is Better: Honda Passport or Toyota 4Runner?\nUnless off-road journeying is your primary concern, you\u2019re better off avoiding the Toyota 4Runner. Like the Passport, the 4Runner is an adventure-ready two-row SUV, but its on-pavement ride is ponderous and clumsy, with lots of jostling from even small road bumps. Unlike the new Passport, the 4Runner looks and feels old inside. It hasn\u2019t been redesigned in nearly a decade, and it lacks the modern safety features available in many rivals. Additionally, this Toyota\u2019s cabin is full of cheap-feeling materials, and it\u2019s more expensive than the base Honda by around $3,100. The Passport is the better SU"}

In 1914, after qualifying as a physician, she settled in Jerusalem and was a pioneer in tending to the health of both Arab and Jewish children, establishing clinics and pediatric centers throughout the region. She died in 1978, having devoted her life to improving the health and welfare of Jerusalem\u2019s children.\nAmong her spheres of activity was the prevention of juvenile delinquency, and she was instrumental in providing an environment where youngsters could find a positive and supportive atmosphere rather than roaming the streets, providing them with coaching in their school work and thereby reducing delinquency and school drop-out rates.\nIn 1968, with the aid of Wizo UK and the Jerusalem municipality, the Kagan Community Center was established in Jerusalem\u2019s Katamon Tet neighborhood in honor of Dr. Kagan\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday. Within that framework the Kagan Learning Center enables youngsters to spend time in a warm and friendly environment where they can receive help in subjects with which they are having difficulties at school.\nWhen I visited the Center I found a large, modern, well-lit building, set back from the dingy street in one of Jerusalem\u2019s less salubrious areas. Inside it are rooms in which tutors, some of them volunteers, provide one-on-one teaching for youngsters who are having difficulties at school, as well as a library and a computer room, and a general atmosphere of relaxed and positive activity.\nMost of the children attending the Center today come from families that have immigrated from Ethiopia, where the language used at home is generally not Hebrew, which puts the child at a disadvantage in their first years at school. Much of the work of the Center involves bringing children in line with the level of their peers in basic subjects such as reading, writing and arithmetic, as well as providing them with the basic concepts that are learned by Israeli-born children even before they start school.\nThe Center\u2019s devoted teachers and administrator maintain contact with the parents of the children who attend and are always willing to help resolve problems connected with the child\u2019s schooling. The Center originally provided its services to the children of the Katamon neighborhood, many of whose parents had immigrated from the countries of the Maghreb and were unable to provide their children with the headstart that these children often required. Today the children who attend the Center live in the neighborhood as well as from elsewhere in Jerusalem.\nAs is usually the case with such institutions, the Center is chronically short of funds; \\ its basic upkeep is provided by the Jerusalem municipality, but it is the Kagan Fund that pays for its staff and equipment, including computers and enrichment activities.

The mother of three was last seen May 12 and her body has not been located.\nKessler has waived all court appearances since her initial arrest, so Tuesday afternoon's hearing was the first time she was seen by the public other than in booking photographs. She entered the courtroom wearing a neon jumpsuit, indicating she is a high-risk prisoner, and wearing a medical mask over her lower face.\nNassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said when she was transferred from Duval County earlier in the day she was wearing the mask as a precaution because she refused to submit to a tuberculosis test.

Under Florida law, evidence from prosecutors becomes public record once it is shared with defense attorneys.\nKessler\u2019s defense lawyers are opposing the release, saying it will hamper her right to a fair trial.\nThe evidence they want blocked includes Kessler\u2019s phone records, a nine-hour video, as well as detective interviews with Kessler and with her former boyfriends.

{"idx": "18534", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: An ill-kept Christmas tree can kill. Here\u2019s how to prevent a holiday disaster.\nThe fresh, cut Christmas tree stands as a fragrant and comforting symbol of the season, but at the risk of injecting some gloom into the holiday, it\u2019s worth pointing out that an ill-kept tree can kill you.\nTree fires are relatively rare, but when they occur, the blaze is so rapid and intense that it can soon turn deadly.\nBetween 2010 and 2012, 10 people died in 200 Christmas tree fires. By contrast, 80 people were killed in a total of 6,500 fires started by candles in the same period, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nA recent demonstration by the commission, conducted at its lab in Rockville, drives home the point. The video shows the ignition of a dried-out tree: In less than 30 seconds, the tree morphs into a floor-to-ceiling Roman candle that consumes its staged room.\nAnother tragic reminder is the fire at the Annapolis mansion of Donald and Sandra Pyle, whose 15-foot Fraser fir was determined to have been the source of an inferno Jan. 19 in which the Pyles and their four grandchildren died. Investigators concluded that the tree probably had been watered only once a week, was dry and dropping needles. The fire probably started from an electrical outlet on the floor beneath the tree, according to a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Anne Arundel County Fire Department. The tree had as many as 15 strands of lights, which had been left on day and night for six weeks.\nHere are some answers to basic questions about caring for your tree, and yourself.\nWhat sort of stand should I use?\nFind a stand that anchors the tree securely and, for a standard cut tree, holds at least a gallon of water. Do not whittle away or shave the base of the tree to make it fit: This will compromise its ability to take up water. A clean, square cut is what you need, and if the trunk is too fat for the stand, get another stand.\nWhen you buy the tree, the bottom inch or so of trunk should be cut afresh. Drilling a hole in the base of the trunk is a waste of time; the sapwood is toward the outside of the trunk.\nIf you can\u2019t install and decorate a tree right away, you should store it in a cool, sheltered area in a bucket of water.\nHow safe are the electric lights on a tree?\nYou should use strands that are designed for indoor use and bear the label of a testing laboratory. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s limits on the number of strands that can be strung together or plugged into one outlet. Before stringing them, check your old lights carefully for frayed or broken wires or loose bulb holders, all of which can cause fires. Damaged strands should be thrown out.\nHow do trees catch fire?\nThey can be ignited from several sources, including open flames such as a candle, from sparks from a nearby fireplace or wood stove, or an electrical short. In the Annapolis fire, investigators think an electrical floor outlet probably overheated and ignited the tree skirt. Dry trees are much more hazardous than hydrated ones.\nWhere should I place my tree?\nThe better question might be, \u201cWhere should I not place it?\u201d Apart from keeping it away from obvious sources of flames, the tree should be located away from heat"}

Why is this annual event, which is a showcase for mobile technology, one big investment signal? On the surface, the event will once again focus on the growing number of connected devices, and we suspect several new flagship models for smartphones will be announced from the likes of Samsung, LG, Huawei and others.\nAlready we've heard of several from Samsung, including its new flagship model the Galaxy S9 that includes an organic light-emitting diode display that should help alleviate demand concerns and support Universal Display (OLED) shares, a holding in the Trifecta Stocks portfolio. As more companies such as Nokia (NOK) , Huawei, LG and others announce devices, both flagship and other, at the event, we suspect year-over-year more models will include organic light-emitting diode displays. Of course, we'll look to confirm that suspicion and as we do so we'll take note of the number of models that have larger screen sizes as well as front and back glass housings, a positive for Trifecta holding Corning (GLW) .\nWe're also likely to get a hefty dose of \"techy talk\" on 5G as carriers such as AT&T (T) , Verizon (VZ) , Sprint (S) and T-Mobile USA (TMUS) will launch commercial 5G networks in 2019. In tandem we should expect press releases and at least a few breakthrough announcements from the likes of Ericsson (ERIC) , Alcatel Lucent (ALU) and others when it comes to 5G data speeds and their network solutions. Cisco Systems (CSCO) did some of that yesterday. We'll be watching this flow of information with regard to shares of specialty contractor Dycom Industries (DY) as that company derives the bulk of its business from building networks for AT&T, Verizon and Comcast (CMCSA) .\nDycom will report its quarterly earnings later this week, and we've held off adding the shares to our active portfolio as we expect the business to be negatively impacted by the harsh winter temps experienced late in the fourth quarter and early in the current quarter. As that is factored into the consensus view, we'll look to revisit DY.\nWith each next-generation mobile technology we've seen a dramatic expansion in what can be done wirelessly. In the 2G world it was voice and text. With 3G we saw the debut of the true mobile internet and the start of apps. With 4G/LTE the app transformation continued and streaming content, both video and music ranging from video calling to watching the latest TV or film to bopping along to your favorite songs as you walk down the street.\nFaster network speeds and greater bandwidth have been a key enabler and the result has been a near quenchless thirst for data and content. So much so that we see extreme user frustration when our smartphones drop down to 4G or even 3G from an LTE connection. One would think anarchy was about to ensue. 5G networks with far faster data speeds compared to 4G/LTE are poised to push the mobile boundaries even further.\nAt Mobile World Congress 2017, Samsung showcased its 5G Home Routers, which achieved speeds of up to 4 gigabits (GBs) per second -- that's 500 megabytes per second.

BitLocker is also Microsoft's encryption tool that ships with Windows.\n\"This page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt,\" the website stated. \"The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images.\" The message urged users to migrate data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported by their operating system platform.\nThe announcement caused widespread bafflement in the IT security industry.\nTrueCrypt, a free, open source encryption file and disk encryption software tool for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, is widely used by corporations, lawyers and other professionals and individuals around the world to encrypt sensitive and confidential data. The software's popularity stems from it ease of use, ability to do on-the-fly encryption of data and robustness.\nThere have been some 29 million downloads of TrueCrypt . In addition, copies of the software have been distributed via magazine cover CDs and downloaded from servers hosted by others.\nDisclosures about the National Security Agency's alleged attempts to subvert popular encryption technologies prompted some to question the trustworthiness of tools like TrueCrypt. The concerns prompted a unique crowdsourced effort to audit TrueCrypt for security issues last fall.\nThe team behind the open crypto audit project released a report in February summarizing their initial findings. The 32-page report identified several vulnerabilities in the encryption code but none that were considered especially serious.\nWednesday's alert on the TrueCrypt site suggests the decision to pull the plug on the project was somehow tied to Microsoft's decision to stop support for Windows XP.\nAlmost no one is buying that.\n\"It makes no sense. This has nothing to do with XP,\" said Bruce Schneier, noted cryptographer and one of those involved in the TrueCrypt audit.\nLike many others posting on blogs and on Twitter, Schneier said he has little idea why the project was killed. He speculated that it might be the result of an internal power struggle within TrueCrypt or a forced shutdown similar to the one at Lavabit a few months ago.\nLavabit, a provider of secure hosted email services, shut down operations last August citing concerns over the FBI's demands for the company's private Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) keys for decrypting email communications. Company founder Ladar Levison said that he would rather shut down the company than hand over the keys that would let the government read customer emails.\nIt's unclear if TrueCrypt's manager's made a similar decision, Schneier said. \"I suppose we'll have to wait and see what develops.\"\nIt is also possible that the site was hacked and defaced, but that seems unlikely given the sophisticated skills it would have taken to pull off such a hack so convincingly, he said.\nFor the moment, users of TrueCrypt's encryption tools should stay put, Schneier said. Until more information becomes available, there is little point in panicking over the security of TrueCrypt. \"Hon"}

But the 49ers in the third quarter failed to punch in a touchdown from inside a yard away on three straight plays with a chance to tie the score. They settled for a short field goal following a George Kittle false start, killing momentum. The Bucs responded with a scoring drive to make it 20-9. Breida\u2019s stats, while impressive, felt empty in the nine-point performance.\nThe 49ers weren\u2019t able to slow Jemeis Winston much, allowing 312 passing yards and two touchdowns on 76 percent completions. The 49ers failed to make an interception despite Winston coming in with 11 in five games this season. Mike Evans caught six of eight targets for 116 yards. He was a tough cover, even for Richard Sherman, who surrendered a 42-yard catch to Evans that led to Tampa Bay\u2019s first touchdown. Cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon had his best performance in three weeks, as Winston missed open receivers with Witherspoon in coverage.\nThe 49ers allowed just 47 yards on 18 carries (2.6 average) to running back Peyton Barber. He was less of a threat than Winston, who gained most of his 26 yards on scrambles. Winston, despite lacking speed and quickness, was often too slippery for San Francisco\u2019s defenders.\nRobbie Gould\u2019s missed extra point in the second quarter was costly until the game got out of hand late. Richie James managed just 14.7 yards per kickoff return while the 49ers needed to flip the field to put the struggling offense in better position. Bradley Pinion punted five times, averaging 42.8 yards.\nKyle Shanahan was put in a tough spot. The 49ers played hours after cutting one of their most talented players in Foster, and the passing game was neutralized with the loss of Goodwin and Gar\u00e7on outside and his third-string quarterback under center. But the Buccaneers (4-7) are hardly world beaters. And the 49ers played like a team primed for the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft."}

There is an additional 1,100 square metres on the first floor that the territorial government is still trying to fill with other health-related services.\nOnce hospital services have been moved to the new building, the existing building will be retrofitted and remediated to remove any hazardous materials such as asbestos. That construction is expected to begin in July 2019 and the building will be operational in the summer of 2021.\nThe awarding of the contract to build the new $300 million hospital was announced September 2015. The territorial government didn't initially plan to build an entirely new hospital, instead it put out a request for proposals to update the existing hospital. But Boreal Health Partnerships, the winning contractor, submitted a plan for an entirely new hospital to sit beside the existing building.\nThe hospital project is being funded using a public-private partnership, or P3 model. Under a P3 model, government hires for-profit companies to finance, design, build and operate public facilities.\nThe territorial government continues to own the existing building and the land that it's on. But under its P3 contract, Boreal Health Partnerships (BHP) is responsible for remediating the building and Ventura Stanton Inc. is responsible for maintaining and operating it.\nBHP brought in the Edmonton based firm Ventura Stanton Inc. to take over management and operations of the building. It's Ventura Stanton's responsibility to find tenants for the space.\nThe territorial government was given the first chance to rent the space and has decided to rent the entire 12,082.2 square metre building for long-term, extended-care and outpatient services.\nEven though the territorial government officially owns the old Stanton Hospital it will be paying rent to Ventra Stanton for the space. Officials wouldn't say how much rent the government is paying but they did say it was paying market rent for the space, which they calculate as between $220-$330 per square metre per year, making market rent for the building between $2,658,000 and $3,987,000 per year.\nHowever, the government may get some of that money back. Whatever revenue Ventra makes from renting the building will be split with the territory, according to the lease agreement (which CBC was able to see, but was not given a copy of).\nBut that agreement also guarantees Ventura will recover its capital costs; only revenue \"over and above\" that recovery must be shared with the territorial government.\nWhat to do with the existing building has been the subject of much debate, with some calling on the government to make it a mental health treatment centre.\nBut the territory is also expecting a significant greying of the territory's"}

However, others are factoring in the reputation of companies and where these organisations are investing their savings, pensions and investments.\nDuring Good Money Week, it is an appropriate time for the industry to encourage and raise the profile of ethical and sustainable investments. The size of the sustainable market in the UK is around \u00a3150bn.\nWhile much of this is dominated by institutional investments, there is a growing market for retail investors too.\nAs well as ethical funds and cash Isas, there are platforms that allow customers to invest in companies that are raising finance for renewable energy and community housing projects.\nImportantly, some of these are eligible to be held within the Innovative Finance Isa, adding tax advantages to ordinary investors.\nThere is clearly progress and appetite, but much of the industry is behind the curve in addressing the demands of consumers. Part of this is down to how products are communicated to customers.\nAccording to our own figures, 51 per cent of the UK\u2019s adult population (some 19.5m) are investing positively or are interested in doing so, yet only 39 per cent of our customers are women.\nAdditionally, Good Money Week\u2019s own research has found that 58 per cent of women do not think financial institutions understand them and their needs.\nProviding tax relief on social investments is an important step, but it doesn\u2019t help if people don\u2019t understand the products in the first place. More must be done to encourage these potential investors and tap this large \u2013 and growing \u2013 market.\nRemoving jargon and adopting language that customers can understand is one step. Improving diversity is vital too.\nHaving more women working in financial services not only will challenge the status quo, but it will have a better understanding to what a product should look like and how it can be created. This is about understanding the motivations of the investor, not simply a number on what it returns.\nGood Money Week is a great initiative for looking at investing as a means of supporting an issue that an investor values.\nIn an investment marketplace which is seeing its values change in line with the new generation, tackling these issues are going to become an increasingly important factor in people\u2019s decisions to invest.\nGood Money Week will hopefully encourage more people to look at the alternatives so that ethical savings and investment products become mainstream options."}

However, Jeff Mannering, the car manufacturer\u2019s managing director for the Middle East, told Emirates Business the type of cars buyers look for in the region differ dramatically from those in demand in Europe. Mannering also spoke about new trends such as the rise of waiting lists for new models and the battle to communicate brand values.\nHow do you evaluate Audi\u2019s performance regionally for 2007 and what are your expectations for 2008?\nThe year 2007 was an excellent one for us. We achieved a volume growth rate of 38.2 per cent compared to the year before. That\u2019s growth from 4,616 vehicles sold in 2006 to 6,380 [in the GCC and Levant, including Yemen]. We opened a regional parts distribution centre in early 2007, started with the certification of our sales staff and opened new showrooms throughout the region. Our objective for 2008 is to continue at a similar pace. With the new Audi A4 and A5, we are launching two great new models that the market is already eagerly awaiting.\nWhat is the UAE\u2019s share in your growth and sales?\nFor the UAE, we recorded an increase of 36.5 per cent in 2007 and 2,602 vehicles were sold during the year.\nThere has been a perception that Audi parts and mechanics are relatively expensive. Is this still the case?\nWe made a strong commitment to the region with the launch of our regional office in 2005. It is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Audi AG. We have been investing heavily in the areas of after sales and training. In 2006, we opened the regional academy for technical and non-technical training. We even have a flying technician and trainer to travel around the region on a regular basis for support. With these initiatives, we have improved the availability and delivery time of parts and the quality of service. Our technicians are highly trained and the perception of service has improved tremendously. Of course, servicing a premium vehicle has its price, but we are in line with the competition.\nTo what extent has Audi been affected by the rising value of the euro and the dirham\u2019s peg to the dollar?\nWe converted to dollar invoicing in the Middle East some years ago, which means Audi AG is absorbing the currency fluctuations through its hedging and no risk is passed on to the customers. The benefit of dollar invoicing is that we can offer stable and transparent prices to customers and at the same time the margin for our dealers remains secure. We simply have not been feeling the rise of the euro in the regional market. But as for our markets in Europe, we have been using the euro and that has been fine for us.\nHow do markets in the Middle East differ from each other?\nWe find Audi customers have very similar tastes across the region, although all markets are different from each other. The local population, for example in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE \u2013 in fact all GCC countries \u2013 are very focused on car customisation and it has been a huge trend. We opened a special customisation showroom called Audi Exclusive in Saudi Arabia last year and are planning to expand the business to other countries too.

Subban started saying \"there's one season that runs all year round and that's the fifth season, the hockey season,\" Wayne Gretzky came up with his own unique division.\nThe hockey season, the Great One once said, comes in five very distinct units. First is the all-but-meaningless exhibition season. Second is the regular season, which runs through to the trading deadline. Third is the \"stretch\" season, where those who traded up jockey for playoff seedings and some who traded away jockey for draft positions. Fourth is the playoffs, where the opening round is usually the most exciting part of the entire hockey year. And fifth is the Stanley Cup final in which, for reasons that range from injuries to referee whistles, the games are played entirely differently from anything that came before.\nThis being all-star weekend, it's a perfect opportunity to take a look at what has happened - and, just as importantly, what has not happened - in this wonky, weird and a few times wonderful 2017-18 NHL season.\nOn the wonky side has to be the rules of the game. When is an offside an offside? If the game is played by humans for the pleasure of humans, why are humans considered incapable of making a simple call?\nAnd as for what now constitutes goaltender interference, let analyst Ray Ferraro's tweet on Thursday's match between the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers speak for itself: \"This is absurd. I am totally disillusioned with what they think they're trying to accomplish. It's clear the rule is 'We don't know what the rule is, so we will throw darts on each review.' Signed NHL.\"\nThe wonky has to be the number of times cameras catch assistant coaches staring at their handy iPads. Has overcoaching made the NHL game so unbearably dull that they're all watching Netflix?\nAs for the wonderful and the not-so-wonderful, we turn first to the welcome surprises.\nThe only hockey team that has no past, the Las Vegas Golden Knights, is the top team in the Western Conference on the 25th anniversary of expansion reaching the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Ottawa Senators, two teams so shafted in their expansion drafts that Tampa general manager Phil Esposito said the league had essentially offered them \"snow in winter.\"\nOther shining surprises would include the Winnipeg Jets (two points shy of Las Vegas), Colorado Avalanche and the Boston Bruins, three teams far exceeding anyone's expectations.\nAs for those surprises that are found in the other direction, look no further than Canada, where the Ottawa Senators came within an overtime goal of the Stanley Cup final last spring and the Edmonton Oilers, with the best player in hockey in Connor McDavid.\nToday, the sinking Senators are 17 points shy of the final playoff spot, the stumbling Oilers 10 points away.\nIt's no surprise that the pride of Cole Harbour, N.S., is battling for the scoring leadership, but a huge surprise that it's Nathan MacKinnon of the Avalanche rather than Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Come February, English teachers pull out poems by Phyllis Wheatley, Langston Hughes, and Maya Angelou; history teachers take on the civil rights movement or abolition. In other subjects, however, Black History Month tends to be overlooked\u2014but that doesn't mean it has to be.\nGiven the underrepresentation of minorities, particularly black students, in STEM fields, an increased focus on black scientists and mathematicians could have a huge impact. On Scientific American, biologist Danielle Lee writes, \"Put simply, members of under-represented communities want to see themselves in these roles. They want to know who the achievers are.\"\nBut while Jemison and Carver are both certainly worth studying, they are far from the only ones. Daniel Hale Williams is a natural fit for a unit on human anatomy\u2014he's generally recognized as conducting the first open-heart surgery, as well as opening the first interracial hospital in the United States.\nElsewhere in the field, Vivien Thomas is credited with developing the Blalock-Taussig shunt, a device used to correct a heart defect that restricts the flow of oxygen. Thomas's story\u2014that of a high school-educated black man who managed to make a name for himself at a then-segregated John Hopkins\u2014is fascinating enough that it was the subject of an HBO movie starring Mos Def and Alan Rickman.\nA lesson on bioethics, meanwhile, could hinge on the story of a figure who was unwittingly of the most important individuals in medicine: Henrietta Lacks, whose body's cells are better known as HeLa cells and have been used in the development of the polio vaccine, cloning, in vitro fertilization, and more. HeLa cells have been undeniably beneficial to modern medicine, but they were obtained after her death, without her family's permission or knowledge, opening a discussion about ethics in medicine.\nThere are also countless lists of other black scientists and inventors online: a timeline from the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Faces of Science website, and this list on Infoplease are a start; the blog Urban Science also points to dozens of individuals, past and present, who made or are making strides in the field. (There's also always Wikipedia, if you're so inclined.) As Lee writes, having students do reports on black scientists can also be a way to help them learn about contemporary scientists who, despite not achieving widespread fame, have made significant contributions.\nWorking Black History Month into a math class can be a little trickier. Pressed to make sure students learn the material, most math teachers don't dwell on history lessons. Even so, the story of Katherine Johnson, the NASA research mathematician whose calculations were critical to the success of the moon landing, could be used as an example of how math can be applied in real-world situations.\nThe same goes for Benjamin Banneker, a self-taught astronomer, inventor, and mathematician whose calculations led him to create a series of almanacs. Banneker also created the first American-made clock and helped lay out the boundaries of Washington D.C.\nEven a short introduction to Johnson, Banneker, or one of the other black mathematicians or scientists throughout history could provide potential role models for black students who may not see many successful STEM leaders who look like them.\nOf course, there's no reason to limit all of this to February.

{"idx": "18582", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It was this past Labor Day weekend when my husband and I, along with some longtime friends who now live in Greensboro, N.C., and Atlanta decided, on a whim, to reunite for a weekend getaway.\nSomeone suggested Columbus and quickly we all were in for an Ohio State football game.\nIt was that weekend when I finally became personally acquainted with the 21st century motorized ride-share industry.\nAs remarkable as that form of shared public transportation was, what I found even more amazing was the number of people there whizzing around campus on publicly shared motorized scooters.\nI quickly found out you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s when someone on a borrowed scooter zipped from the sidewalk into the street with total disregard for the poor Uber driver who was trying to maneuver us out of the post-game stadium traffic and back to our hotel.\nUnder the ride-share business model, anyone with the app on a smartphone can rent a scooter from wherever the last rider happened to leave it \u2014 whether alongside the road, on a sidewalk or at the curb. That makes it even more likely that riders won\u2019t be wearing helmets.\nEnabled by GPS technology, the scooters provide an easy way for pedestrians to travel relatively short distances in urban settings. Apparently, Columbus isn\u2019t the only place that e-scooters have become all the rage \u2014 and also not the only place where some say they are becoming a nuisance.\nIn Charlotte, N.C., for example, riders racked up 82,523 trips covering 81,484 miles in December. But city council there voted in January to ban e-scooters from sidewalks in most of the uptown, as well as cap speeds and charge scooter companies a per-unit fee.\nOther cities such as Seattle, Saint Paul, Nashville, Boston and Miami also have banned the scooters, reported Fox News.\nA recent investigation by Consumer Reports that I read last week found 1,500 e-scooter injuries reported nationwide since 2017 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include all hospitals because many still don\u2019t track them. The figure was obtained in a \u201cspot tally\u201d the magazine compiled from major hospitals and other public agencies, such as police departments, contacted in recent weeks.\nConsumer Reports contacted hospitals and agencies in 47 cities where big scooter companies operate. Several doctors reported treating serious e-scooter injuries since the ride-share fleets started showing up on city streets about a year and a half ago.\nThe emergency chief at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta estimated the emergency department treated 360 such injuries. Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville has seen 250 people with injuries.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple concussions, nasal fractures, bilateral forearm fractures, and some people have required surgery,\u201d said Beth Rupp, medical director at the Indiana University Health Center where ride-share e-scooters were introduced in September.\nCertainly, the visionary behind the e-scooter business was brilliant. The system is profitable and full of positives.\nFun? Sure. Easy and convenient? Absolutely.\nBut risky? Without a doubt.\nAt this point in my life, it\u2019s probably safe to say my son\u2019s amusement with my ride-share initiation will be limited to modes of transportation with four wheels and doors."}

When asked if Russia interfered in the US vote Putin said, \"Read my lips: No.\"\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer earlier this week downplayed questions about Russia ties .\n\"If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russia connection,\" he said in an exchange with reporters.\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing officials with knowledge of the matter, reported that Flynn had sought immunity from the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence panels in exchange for his testimony. The newspaper said he had so far found no takers.\nThe FBI declined to comment. The Senate committee did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.\nHe said Flynn \"is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated\".\nKelner said Flynn would not \"submit to questioning in such a highly politicised, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution\"."}

So will the extra sums given to people who work 30 or more hours a week, and to lone parents and couples.\nThe additional amount paid to claimants aged 50 and over who are returning to the job market after a period on certain benefits - the \"50-plus element\" - will be abolished, even for those who are already receiving it.\nPerhaps the biggest change will be that couples with children will have to work 24 hours a week between them, not 16, in order to qualify for working tax credit.\nOne member of the couple will have to work at least 16 hours a week.\nNote that this new rule will not affect lone parents.\nIndeed, the government sees this change as reducing the disparity between couples and lone parents by ensuring that at least one member of a couple is required to work the same minimum number of hours per week as must a lone parent.\nThere are some important exceptions to the 24 hours rule.\none partner works at least 16 hours a week and the other partner is \"incapacitated\", an in-patient in hospital, or in prison.\nA person is \"incapacitated\" if they are getting one of a list of sickness or disability benefits or pensions, or one of those benefits is being paid to their partner.\nIt is not yet clear just how HMRC will operate the new rule.\nIts systems may not be able to identify couples who fall within one of the exceptions above, and those couples may have to come forward and tell HMRC.\nThe element of Child Tax Credit (CTC) which can be claimed for each individual child will increase from April 2012 by nearly 5.3%.\nSimilarly generous increases apply to the amounts for disabled and severely disabled children.\nBut the \"first income threshold\" at which the CTC begins to be withdrawn - by 41p for each \u00a31 of income above the threshold - remains the same as in 2011-12, at an annual income of \u00a315,860.\nThis detracts slightly from the generosity of the increase in the child elements.\nIn previous years, higher earners could continue receiving the full \"family element\" of CTC - \u00a3545 per annum - until their annual income reached the \"second income threshold\".\nThis was \u00a350,000 until last year, then it dipped to \u00a340,000.\nFor 2012-13 it will be removed altogether.\nThis means that as soon as income reaches the"}

He said his group is working against the radicalization of protesters.\nSince the military removed Morsi in July, the interim government has been waging a fierce crackdown on the Brotherhood and other Islamists, killing hundreds and arresting more than 16,000.\nAt the same time, police and the military have faced a campaign of car bombs and suicide bombings hitting security facilities and assassinations of officers. In some cases, security officers' cars have been torched.\nMany of the biggest and most sophisticated attacks have been claimed by an al-Qaida-inspired militant group based in the Sinai Peninsula. Ajnad Misr has claimed several smaller bombings since January. The government accuses the Brotherhood of orchestrating the violence, branding it a terrorist organization \u2014 a claim the group denies and calls a pretext for wiping it out.\nWednesday's blasts \u2014 using what authorities said were crude homemade explosives \u2014 were rare in that they targeted police forces in the field directly deployed to face protesters.\nThe three blasts were also staggered in time. The first two bombs, which security officials said were hidden at the foot of a tree, went off less than a minute apart near a security post of riot police, security officials said.\nThe third, concealed up another tree nearby, exploded nearly two hours later, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.\nAjnad Misr said in its statement that the third blast was delayed to spare civilians nearby. The tactic has been frequently used in Iraq by Sunni militants fighting the Shiite-led government \u2014 using secondary explosions to target members of the emergency services and reinforcements who come to the aid of those wounded in the first blast.\nThe first two blasts sprayed nails packed into the explosives, killing police Brig. Gen.

We've been practicing hard, (defensive line) coach (Brett) Watson has been really getting into us. We've been practicing really well this past week.\nBut that also meant the offensive line struggled to contain the pass rush.\nVaughan said the purpose of the scrimmage for the offense was to give younger players some opportunities, but he also saw areas where the offense still needs to improve.\n\"We weren't pleased with everything that happened,\" Vaughan said. \"There were a lot of sacks today and incompletions. I think we just need to continue to work. It's good to know the things we need to work on going into the season.\"\nThe scrimmage also featured several special teams plays, including a 55-yard field goal by senior kicker Sergio Castillo Jr. late in the scrimmage and several return plays.\n\"I thought the kicking game was solid for what you get to see,\" interim head coach Mike Nesbitt said. \"I mean you're not gong to kill everybody on a kicking game right now, but it was good enough to get a true look.\"\nNesbitt also said he was pleased with the defensive play, but he would like to see the offense be more physical.\nHowever, those are questions the team will only truly be able to answer once it gets in actual game situations, Nesbitt said.\n\"The unknown is still out there for this team,\" he said. \"How are we going to play when adversity hits them?

A cloudburst at the head of Cajon Street was responsible for most of the resultant damage. The first flood came from Redlands Heights and was just beginning to subside when a second flood came down the zanja. Considerable damage was done along the path of the flood waters.\nLater in the afternoon a heavy thunder storm struck San Bernardino and rain fell in torrents for 30 minutes. At Highland a barn was struck by lightning and two horses were killed.\nAs a result of this storm, the city issued storm water bonds and built the ditches now to be seen in various parts of the town and which have successfully aided in disposing of storm water ever since.\nThe new cement sidewalk, which has just been completed on Orange Street in front of the City Market and the Oxford Hotel, brings reminiscences to City Engineer Hinckley.\nThe old sidewalk in front of the City Market was probably the first sidewalk laid in Redlands and was built about 1887. Orange Street at that time was not even an oiled thoroughfare and was dusty in summer and muddy in winter. That was before the entrance of either steam or electric roads into Redlands. The City Market building then was occupied by the First National Bank, and President F.P. Morrison was then as now the president of the institution but in addition he was largely cashier, bookkeeper and several other officers as well.\nMr. Hinckley says that some of his earliest remembrances were of trips to the bank from the Hinckley ranch near Bryn Mawr to get money to pay workmen. He made the trip on horseback and though so small he had to pull himself up by his hands in order to see over the counter at the bank window, he made numerous trips, carrying back coin in a sack for workmen on the ranch and at the drier.\nOn a recent visit to Urbita Springs Park, Paul Shoup of the Pacific Electric, president of the largest electric railway system in the world, enjoyed the novel experience of meeting \u201cBuddy\u201d Courcy, president of the Urbita Lake railway, which is probably the shortest steam railway in the world, with undoubtedly the youngest president in the world.\nAs residents of the San Bernardino Valley know, the Urbita Lake railway is the new miniature railway at Urbita Springs Park, and although it is only half a mile in length, it is thoroughly equipped with the most modern cars and engines and possesses a complete staff of officials and employees under the presidency of Buddy Courcy, the general manager and principal stockholder.\nHaving been accustomed all his life to boss the owner of the road, it was quite easy for him to assume control of the road itself, and at last account, a perfect state of discipline prevailed and all trains were on time.\nWhile at Urbita Springs Park recently, President Shoup of the Pacific Electric thoroughly enjoyed a long visit with his old friend Bill Simpson, engineer of the miniature railway at that popular resort. This railway enjoys the distinction of having the youngest president and oldest engineer in the world, the president being Buster Courcy, who has just celebrated his second birthday, and the engineer being a veteran prominently identified with"}

It\u2019s a reasonable bet that none of those present at Rambouillet envisaged that 43 years later the annual get-together for their successors would be in Hangzhou.\nThe emergence of China as an economic superpower with its distinctive breed of state capitalism is a striking example of what has changed in the past four decades. Back then, the six developed nations represented at Rambouillet dominated the global economy. These days it would be inconceivable to hold a meeting to discuss trade, currencies or climate change without the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, the Russians and the Saudis.

The inspiration for Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s fireside chat in 1975 was the stagflation unleashed by the weakening of the post second world war boom, triggered by soaring oil prices. The summit was an attempt to reinvigorate the full employment model that had delivered record levels of growth over the previous quarter of a century, but it proved impossible to return to business as usual. Time was up for a generation represented by Harold Wilson and Gerald Ford, both attendees at Rambouillet.\nThe G20 was born in equally difficult circumstances. It met for the first time in Washington a couple of months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, just after the US had voted for Barack Obama to succeed George W Bush. As in the 1970s, the prevailing economic model had suffered system failure. This time the problem was caused by unfettered capital flows and over-exposed banks. Again the imperative was to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. Again, the attempt has been unsuccessful.\nYou don\u2019t need the skills of a Bletchley Park cryptographer to get the gist. The fund\u2019s message is that there is a lack of investment, a lack of good, well-paid jobs, and a growing disenchantment with the status quo. Hence Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the Rio Grande. Hence Brexit, the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy, and the support for Marine Le Pen in France.\nTo be sure, these trends can be over-stated. Governments of the centre-right and centre-left are still in power in Germany, Italy and France. The polls suggest Trump is going to lose to Hillary Clinton, and Le Pen is unlikely to be the next president of France. Greece\u2019s experiment with the radical left has not been an unalloyed success.\nBut the fund is still right to be concerned. Globalisation was sold to voters in the west as a system that would deliver greater prosperity for all through more open markets. Yet as the IMF noted, the income for top earners in many developed countries has been rising while remaining stagnant for those at the bottom. The customers are not getting what it says on the tin.\nIn his new book*, Guy Standing says it is a myth that the political and economic changes of the 1970s created free markets. Instead, he argues, globalisation has hastened the development of rigged markets dominated by \u201ca plutocracy and plutocratic corporations linked to concentrated financial capital that are able to gain increasing amounts of rental income by virtue of their wealth.

Meanwhile March thought deeply about the signicance of SuperGiant, a quartet that had, much like its namesake, grown and grown to epic proportions as it sought the ultimate starry communion with the sky.\nA quartet composed of Jeremy McCollum on guitar, vocalist Joel Rogers, bassist Keith Laffler and drummer Gary Chavez, SuperGiant represents the best of what rock can be in the Duke City: loud, proud and intricate, with deeply melodic vocals, tasty riffs and a propulsive rhythm section that speaks to and of the deep desert at that precise moment when dark becomes life, when cacti turn their flowers to the sun and the sound of the universe erupts everywhere, from each pore and all the surfaces in that drifting, starstrewn environment.\nAnd you know they didn\u2019t get to that place by accident. Years of hard work, constant touring and consequently developing a fan base here and around the country have led SuperGiant to their fifth album, a star-turn called The Tree of Life.\nWeekly Alibi met with the members of SuperGiant to get a better idea of what their brightness portends and to find indications of where the road will lead a quartet of rockers who came up in El Burque, gigging as they went, even as their journey to the stars and beyond becomes evident in their music and in their moves.\nOn Friday April 5, SuperGiant debuts their new disc at Sister; they\u2019ll be distributing copies of The Tree of Life to all who attend.\nWeekly Alibi: You guys are stalwarts of the scene. You\u2019ve survived and thrived while many bands have come and gone. What\u2019s the history of the band, how did you come together, for readers who might not be familiar with SuperGiant?\nJeremy McCollum: I acutally started the band with Gary, the drummer. That originally came from an ad in Weekly Alibi, back in the days when people would actually post ads looking for other musicians to jam with. I put an ad in that said, \u201chey I wanna put a band together.\u201d I didn\u2019t know anyone to start that with.

In Finland, the ongoing years venture-funding activity has been twofold. On one hand, the total amount of capital raised by Finnish startups decreased from the first half totals of the preceding years, while on the other hand, the number of investments into these startups grew for a fourth consecutive first half.\nIn terms of raised capital, Finnish technology ventures accumulated \u20ac61 million in venture funding over the first six months of 2014. This figure falls far off the \u20ac167 million collected in the first half of 2013. Although, the drop looks drastic on paper, a look behind the numbers provides a bit of perspective.\nThe start of 2014 was characterised by a lack of large later stage rounds, as only three investments eclipsed \u20ac4 million in value. In comparison, a total of five investments surpassed \u20ac6 million in funding in the first half of 2013, including the extraordinary \u20ac100 million pre-exit funding round of Supercell. However, concluding that the numbers would signal a dearth in later stage funding is a very rash judgment. Interestingly, despite being so far off from the previous year total valuation and average round size, the median investment value grew by \u20ac50,000 during this span to \u20ac600,000.\nOn a more positive note, the 57 venture capital investments into Finnish startups during the fist half of this year was the highest round total of the nascent decade. The connotations of this increase in funding activity are only positive. The surge of early stage investments implies a growing base of ambitious and competitive startups ready to take the next step. With SLUSH expecting to more than double the amount of startups in attendance from last year, it is increasingly hard to argue against this development.\nOn the investor side, this rise in the early stage investment activity denotes further proof of venture capitalists' willingness to invest into startups earlier than before in the hopes of higher returns. Duly 48 of the recorded 57 funding rounds were classified as seed or startup stage investments. The willingness of foreign investors to partake in early stage investments was also evident; with 15 of the 19 cases involving an international investor occurring in the formative phases.\nAlthough, financially this years' funding activity has not been anything to write home about, the signs seem to point towards a developing venture capital market and better fundraising years for Finland on the horizon. With early stage funding continually gaining traction, the upcoming years are bound to produce more lucrative late stage investments as the current crop of startups mature.\nHowever, in spite of the encouraging outlook, the Finnish funding ecosystem cannot rest on its laurels. As hungry and able startups are budding by the dozens, more money and expertise will be looked for to help them blossom."}

As he travels the country seeking to introduce himself to voters as well as build support for his presidential campaign, Obama is taking a rhetorical approach that differs from candidates in both parties.\nMost presidential candidates use their stump speeches to state their views and exhort the faithful. If they are good, they use their speeches as points of inspiration. Obama's tactic is more grounded and very purposeful. As he told Adam Nagourney of The New York Times, \"I use a different style if I'm speaking to a big crowd; I can gin up folks pretty well.\" This is the style that he used in 2004 during the Democratic Convention when he introduced himself to the national public as a young politician running for senator. The faithful were enthralled. At the same time, Obama realizes that \"when I am in these town hall settings, my job is not to throw them a lot of red meat.\" That is, he's not stumping overtly for votes; he's giving people a \"sense of my thought process.\" In doing so, Obama is carving a good niche for himself as a thinking man's populist, a fresh face but one with a brain as big as his smile.\nThose of us not running for office can learn from Obama's style, and in fact from what politicians from either party do. And that is varying your style to your audience. Skilled leaders know to vary their messages to audiences. For example, if you are speaking to an in-house group, you can be more revealing about what's going on inside the company than if you are speaking to a group of reporters. Public relations pros school their executives in developing different messages for different groups. But often not enough time is spent on varying speaking style, that is informal versus formal, or declamatory versus reflective. Varying that style is critical. So often audiences do not remember specific words or phrases but they do remember what the speaker looked like and whether he seemed sincere.\nPublic figures can serve as role models when selecting a speaking style. The mere mention of their names conjures up instant images of who they are and what they sound like. Here are some folks to consider emulating for messages you must deliver.\nThink Ronald Reagan when you want inspire. Few could rouse audiences as well as President Reagan. Consider his speech in the wake of the Challenger disaster when he praised the bravery of the astronauts but also made it very clear that space travel would continue because it was important to our national identity. A more stern Reagan lectured the Soviet Union in Berlin by challenging the Soviet premier: \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" He was reflecting the hopes and dreams of free people everywhere.\nThink Bill Clinton when you want to win someone over. Whether you think of him as Slick Willie or Mr. President, Bill Clinton is a master at connecting. He does not reflect what audiences want to hear; he inhales it and spins it so they feel that he is one with them. At the same time, he was a \"policy wonk,\" and could revel in the details of governmental minutiae. But when speaking to the nation, he was down-home and plain.\nThink Martin Luther King when you want to call to action.

Jaime Engdahl, Program Manager for the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration, after observing the X-47B maiden flight at EAFB today.\nAs we said above, this is a major event in the development of unmanned combat planes. For the last decade, slow and unstealthy MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reapers have owned the armed drone mission. The problem is, these planes aren't likely to last long in a serious war.\nWhile the Air Force has publicly fielded one stealth drone, the RQ-170 Sentinel, that plane remains unarmed (at least officially). The Northrop Grumman-built X-47B is meant to prove the concept of a aircraft carrier-based, combat drone capable of doing everything from ISR missions to close air support. This is history being made.\nThe flight is the first of 50 planned for the rest of the year where Navy officials will put the jet (and eventually a second X-47B) through increasingly challenging flight situations to make sure the plane works as designed. Once this is finished, the two jets will move to Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland where they'll gear up for carrier testing.\nStealthy, survivable planes like the X-47B and it's successors will play an increasingly important role in the Pentagon's plans to overcome advanced anti access and area denial systems. The planes will someday be capable of being refueled in flight; allowing them to take off from carriers far from shore and fly into relatively high threat environments where they can work with other stealth jets such as the B-2, F-22, F-35 to accomplish their mission. However, one of the big challenges in sending these planes downrange for missions like this will be data assurance; basically protecting the signals that control the aircraft from being hijacked by the enemy.\nAnother pic after the jump."}

{"idx": "18612", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Silvery gray turns the master bath into a tranquil retreat.\n4 What Paint Colors Are Calming & Make a Room Big?\nThe bathroom is one of the hardest-working spaces in your home. When it\u2019s time to redecorate, choose a paint color that works with the room\u2019s light and creates a good mood in the bathroom\u2019s users. Whether you\u2019re painting a family bathroom shared by adults and kids, a powder room mostly used by guests or the master bath that greets you each morning and sends you off to bed each night, color sets the tone for the space.\nBefore choosing your paint color, consider how much light the bathroom receives. If there is only one small window -- or no window at all -- your bathroom is probably dim much of the day. Use paint to create an open, airy feel. Soft colors with a bit of warmth will light up the space. Creamy white, soft yellow, pink, apricot and sand are good choices for a dim bathroom, and also create the illusion of a larger space. Stay away from cool colors such as blue, gray or lavender unless you add extra lighting to the room.\nMake an impression on guests with a powder room that is sophisticated yet not overbearing. A black and white combination always looks crisp and traditional yet takes on a sophisticated edge when paired with gray, pink or gold. Alternatively, choose an unusual, striking color combination. Brown with turquoise or lavender is fresh and strong without being garish or too dark. If you want a simple style, go with strong neutral tones. Choose a palette of rich browns, sage green and dusky blue softened with touches of cream instead of pale or boring neutral colors.\nIn a bustling family bathroom, keep things cheerful with paint in a bright tone. Sunny yellow, sky or periwinkle blue, grass green, tropical orange or barn red all have enough oomph to stand up to nonstop traffic, please the kids and cheer up sleepy adults. Keep it from going overboard by painting the trim and ceiling white. If brights are too much zing for your tastes, consider shades that hover between pastel and mid-tone, or paint just one bright wall.\nIf you're painting the master bath, consider a palette that is tranquil and soothing. A spa-like room is a restful retreat at the end of a tiring day. Pick soft colors from nature. The hazy green and blue of a misty ocean, the sandy tan of the shore, the rich brown of fresh soil or the silvery gray of a cloud's lining all soothe the soul while keeping the room sophisticated yet relaxed. Use ivory or cream trim to avoid a dreary or monotone appearance.\nUllman, Michelle. \"How to Choose a Color to Paint the Bathroom.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/choose-color-paint-bathroom-73959.html.

{"idx": "18613", "prompt": "Continue the following text: OK, in Episode I, your humble blogger talked about what undergraduates should and should not do to get into a quality Ph.D. program in political science. In this exciting sequel, the natural question to ask is, \"what if I\u2019m not an undergraduate?\"\nTo explain the advice I\u2019m about to give, however, let me begin with a small parable. Consider two applicants, Johnny Undergrad and Jenny Postgrad. By a strange coincidence, Johnny and Jenny matriculated at the same undergraduate institution, received identical grades during their time as undergraduates, and both wrote fine theses. They both followed the guidance provided in my dos and don\u2019ts post to the letter. The only difference is that Jenny is four years out of college, while Johnny is not. The latter, a senior, is now applying to grad programs. So is Jenny, but she\u2019s spent the past four years earning some coin and collecting some very relevant work experience for an important government/multinational corporation/NGO/think tank organization.\nNow, you would think, ceteris paribus, that Jenny would have the stronger application for a Ph.D. admissions committee \u2013 she\u2019s more mature, more seasoned, and possesses an identical academic record. But you would likely be wrong.\nSee, Johnny has been in more recent contact with his undergrad professors. Since their memory of Johnny is likely stronger than Jenny, their letters of recommendation will be less bland and boilerplate. Johnny hasn\u2019t signaled that callings other than being a professor might tempt him, since he applied straight out of undergrad. Johnny\u2019s grades are an accurate reflection of his abilities, whereas Jenny\u2019s academic skills atrophy with every year out of the ivory tower (pro tip: if you don\u2019t know what ceteris paribus means, you\u2019re in trouble). Any thesis that Johnny has written is more up-to date.\n1. Reconnect with your professors. You need to have strong letters of recommendation, and almost all of those letters should come from people inside the academy. Fair or not, admissions committees will discount letters from people who themselves do not have a Ph.D.. If you\u2019re thinking of applying to a Ph.D. program, start by making sure the profs who you worked closely with as an undergraduate have a sharp memory of you. Remind them of what you were interested in as an undergrad and update them on what\u2019s your interests are now. If you\u2019ve collaborated with academics during your post-bac jobs, make sure they write you a letter. You will need one recommendation from your supervisor/boss even if they don\u2019t have a Ph.D. \u2013 but make damn sure that, besides praising your overall competence and maturity, they talk about your burning desire to go back to the academy.\n2. Ace your GREs. The GREs are a good first approximation of whether you have the intellectual chops to cut it in a doctoral program. If you\u2019ve been out of school for a while, they might count a bit more, because there is that question of whether you\u2019re really ready to go back to school. An outstanding GRE score will not automatically get you admitted, but it can allay any fears about your abilities to earn a Ph.D.\n3. Craft your personal statement with care. You have a more interesting tale to tell than undergraduate applicants, because you\u2019re like, older and stuff. That said, the statement also needs to signal an admissions committee that you know exactly what you are getting yourself into, and are eager for the challenge. Sure, you can talk about how your research interests"}

At the time City Council members and several members of the public expressed support for the sidewalk during a council meeting, Trestik said.\nIf no appeals are made, the City Council would consider awarding a construction contract, Trestik said.\nThe commission voted 5-0 to seek the Arts Commission's input for a proposed wall and railing replacement along Mermaid Street. The city's public works department wants to remove an existing retaining wall and replace it with a textured block wall. Commissioners agreed the wall needed repair but differed in terms of quality and how quickly a new wall could be put in place.\nZur Schmiede said due diligence should be exercised to place the best possible material that will last and also have aesthetic appeal.\n\"Could we put a veneer, stone?\" Zur Schmiede asked Trestik.\n\"Yes, but it comes down to cost,\" Trestik said.\nA textured block wall is being proposed instead of a concrete wall. The proposed wall is light brown and split-faced. It has been used at other locations in the city such as 1476 Coast Hwy. and 2626 Glenneyre St. Due to limited right-of-way access, a wall made of steel posts and wood is not being considered.\nThe project is expected to cost $300,000 according to a development application.\nTrestik mentioned the importance of getting the sidewalk completed in time for summer.

{"idx": "18616", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Is Windows-everywhere a serious option for the modern business?\nLet\u2019s get real says Dale Vile, Research Director & CEO, of analyst group Freeform Dynamics.\nBusinesses bought into Windows two decades go. Many IT professionals today, in fact, can\u2019t remember a time when Microsoft didn\u2019t dominate in desktop and notebook space. We may have seen a few Macs being adopted by VIP users and creative staff, and perhaps a bit of Linux here and there, but it\u2019s still largely a Windows world when it comes to PC class machines in business today.\nSo if businesses are that bought in, why not extend the reach of Windows beyond workstations and notebooks to tablets and smartphones? As this 30-second marketing video suggests, running Windows \u2018everywhere\u2019 would allow a consistent user experience to be delivered across all classes of device.\nSuch a proposition could arguably be attractive to IT departments trying to resist the influx of iOS and Android devices onto their network, which they are not always geared up to handle. If you have to accommodate mobile devices, life will be easier if they all run a familiar operating system that you know how to secure, manage and support.\nBut there\u2019s a snag with this reasoning. When Microsoft speaks of Windows running across all device types, it\u2019s not referring to the operating system underpinning most desktop computing activity today. Indeed it\u2019s not even talking about the familiar Windows desktop experience from a user interface perspective. What it\u2019s really promoting is Microsoft\u2019s \u2018modern\u2019 tile-based interface across all form factors.\nAt the time of writing, this kind of Windows everywhere strategy would mean deploying three relatively new operating systems (Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 for x86), and three different application development, deployment and administration models. This would be in addition to maintaining the application and operations model already in place to handle the classic Windows x86 environments such as Windows 7 or Windows 8 in \u2018desktop\u2019 mode.\nEven if, as rumoured, Microsoft consolidates its range of Windows platforms, this certainly isn\u2019t the \u2018write once, deploy anywhere, manage consistently\u2019 approach that many IT professionals crave.\nBut despite all this, surely there is still value in delivering a consistent user experience across all devices, right?\nWell perhaps theoretically, but the point is moot. We have already moved to a multi-platform world in relation to mobile computing in business, and we aren\u2019t coming back any time soon. Furtherore, even if you conclude that the latest/modern Windows interface is the most desirable and efficient of all options available, it doesn\u2019t come with two important benefits that Windows users have taken for granted over the years.\nBeyond operational considerations, Windows stickiness on workstations and notebooks has been largely down to user familiarity and investment in applications, both of which are sacrificed as soon as you step away from the traditional desktop environment. Worse than that, as you enter the domain of mobile and touch, user familiarity and historical app investment are already firmly associated with other platforms.\nFor many users, the iPhone was the first real smartphone they ever experienced, and they have stuck with it through multiple generations of hardware and software, acquiring apps along the way. And just like Windows on the desktop, it really doesn\u2019t matter if objective reviewers declare alternatives to be better; users in both a consumer and business context tend to stay with what they know and what they have spent money on, and are generally not interested in changing.\nWe can obviously broaden this familiarity and app investment debate and discuss the obsessive loyalty of Mac users, the vigorous advocates of Android, and the-die hard defenders of Black"}

Whether you're a recent graduate looking for a foot in the door or a supply chain veteran hungry for a change of scenery, the power is in your hands. Organizations across Supply Management are beginning to recognize that attracting a stand-out candidate will mean taking pains to make themselves a stand-out organization. Can't-miss opportunities are waiting for those applicants who take the appropriate action.\nA candidate's market doesn't mean applicants can get away with anything. Most of the same old rules still apply and that means the same old words and phrases will land your resume in the wastebasket. Here are a few descriptors that'll make your application stand out for all the wrong reasons.\nI'll never forget the look on my freshman English professor's face when he saw 'utilized' peppered throughout my first paper. Let's just say he wasn't pleased. To be fair, the impulse to utilize 'utilize' is understandable. A word like 'use' can look too basic, too simple to impress a hiring manager. In reality, including this word does little more than add 6 unnecessary letters to your resume. It's important to remember that recruiters and hiring managers aren't scanning your resume to prove you've cracked open a thesaurus. They want to see evidence that you've made a quantifiable difference in past positions. When in doubt, avoid flowery synonyms and opt for the simplest option.\n\"I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs.\" Those words from Stephen King apply to just about any kind of writing, but they're especially wise when it comes to resumes. Like lengthy synonyms, adverbs and adjectives add nothing to your argument. They're merely taking up space and distracting from the document's substance. Take my use of the word 'lengthy' a few sentences back. What did that add to the point I was trying to make? Not a whole lot. That's not to say you should abandon adverbs altogether. Think of adverbs like candy. In an otherwise healthy diet (or document), they're welcome from time to time. Too many, however, and your body, mind, and resume will suffer.\nA good resume paints a picture of a powerful, active professional. The word 'helped' does neither. It lacks specificity and reflects nothing in the way of authority or ownership. Hiring managers are looking for details that speak to how you've set yourself apart in the past. For all they know, 'helped' means 'made coffee' or 'showed up on time.' Instead of help, select words that speak to the tasks you performed and the tangible results they produced. Don't leave Procurement's recruiters and hiring managers trying to guess what you did for past employers. Make it clear exactly how you'll 'help' them deliver on their objectives.\nYou only get one chance to make a first impression. Make it count by crafting a detailed, specific, and meaningful resume. A good resume isn't the only thing you'll need to get hired, but a bad one is definitely all you'll need to get rejected."}

US officials acknowledge that this means they have abandoned hope of maintaining an ethnically mixed Bosnian nation, and that Serbs will gain some ground seized by aggression.\nThe Bosnian civil war \"has not been resolved in the way I would have hoped,\" said President Clinton at a press conference last week.\nThe European Community at its Copenhagen summit rejected a US-backed German effort to get the EC to approve ending the arms embargo that has disadvantaged Bosnia's Muslims. (Summit results, Page 2.) In the end, the EC at its Copenhagen summit focused largely on trying to get Bosnia's Muslim leadership to agree to talks on the tripartite partition plan, which was first proposed by the presidents of Serbia and Croatia.\nThus ends the long odyssey of the so-called Vance-Owen plan, which had called for a complicated Bosnian map of 10 inter-related ethnic zones. The Bosnian Serbs felt Vance-Owen gave away too much they had taken by force of arms.\nAs critics of the West's approach point out, as long as no one was threatening the Bosnian Serbs with force if they didn't go along with Vance Owen, there was little reason for them to accept it.\nThe tripartite plan, on the other hand, will result in a Bosnian entity that is a state in name only. The Croat- and Serb- dominated provinces will inevitably be pulled toward their neighboring Croatian and Serbian nations.\n\"Partition was inevitable and we should have seen it coming,\" says University of Chicago international relations professor John Mearsheimer.\nThe bleak feeling within the US government on Bosnia was well-illustrated by an unusual meeting two weeks ago between a senior administration official and a group of defense reporters. Under the ground rules of the meeting the official cannot be identified, though it can be said that he is more in the business of providing advice than making policy.\nTHE senior official judged that the creation of UN safe havens for Muslim refugees in Bosnia will simply create refugee camps that breed despair. He said that the Vance-Owen plan had no chance to work even if implemented.\nEven the Clinton administration's so-called \"lift and strike\" proposal to lift the arms embargo on Muslims and conduct US airstrikes against Serbs - rejected as too harsh by Europeans - would have had little effect, according to the official.\nThe official said that in essence the Clinton administration had inherited a situation it could do little about. \"You are basically working at the margins of the problem,\" he said.\nNot all officials are so pessimistic in their outlook. But it seems the point of US policy is now focusing on preventing the Bosnian chaos from spreading deeper into Eastern Europe.\nSome analysts suggest that one way the West might regain credibility for its efforts to prevent conflict in the region is to reorient NATO toward east-central Europe. This could head off the most dangerous long-term scenario facing the US: that instability will spread throughout the economically pressed area of the old Soviet bloc.\nZalmay Khalilzad, a former Bush Defense Department official now at RAND, argues that the US should offer membership in NATO to Poland,"}

This tulip displays what is considered triadic harmony, garden writer Norman Winter of Georgia says, because it blooms in three shades: fuchsia pink, mauve rose and a deep rose pink.\nWhen shopping for bulbs and planting them, remember to mass them in one color for the biggest impact. This is hard for me because I\u2019m a sampler, wanting to try lots of kinds of things. I have already violated the rule by buying a Green With Envy mix \u2014 the viridiflora tulips so named because they have streaks of green through the petals.\nAnother way to make an impact is to plant bulbs that will bloom in the same season. While massive plantings such as those in neighborhoods often combine early-, mid- and late-season bloomers for a longer bloom period, \u201cI\u2019d rather have a big show and a short show than a mediocre show and a long show,\u201d said Robin Macy, owner of Bartlett Arboretum in Belle Plaine.\nPat McKernan at Botanica plants mainly mid- and late-season tulips, because that\u2019s when people expect to see them. He does include some early-season ones, too, though, for the surprise factor.\nPat says there\u2019s often a solitary bulb of one color that pops up in a sea of another color. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s so great that we screw up,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s either the result of distributor error, or a bulb survives in the ground and pops back up, he says.\nKari Ossman at Wichita State notes that tulips traditionally are planted in clumps; small clumps accent a small garden. And planting tulips in drifts rather than in lines make a small planting look larger, Winter writes.\nAt WSU, hitting the mark means watering the bed where the bulbs will be planted, raking it to level it, then watering again and raking again. When the soil is dry enough, the bulbs then are planted, and Treflan is put on top of the soil at the very last. \u201cThe pre-emergent keeps it clean until May,\u201d Kari says.

The results are actually shocking when considering the fact that the AI has generated faces of humans who don\u2019t actually exist. Nvidia\u2019s researches have built on top of the work of Ian Goodfellow from 2014 by introducing the principles of Style Transfer to a modified version of Generative Adversarial Network, also known as GAN. While GAN generates images after looking at a source, a Discriminator Network tries to separate the fake images from realistic ones.\nTo this, Nvidia\u2019s researchers added style transfer principles to fuse the characteristics of one image into another. In essence, two neural networks combined with style transfer could generate some very realistic looking images of people who don\u2019t even exist. Nvidia\u2019s researchers tried to do the same with cat images too, but cats have proved to be difficult so far.\nFake news has been a growing problem for the past few years. Deepfakes have become increasingly difficult to identify, and with Nvidia\u2019s AI being able to generate images of non-existent people, this could pose bigger challenges in the future. There have been several demos of researchers being able to generate fake videos featuring popular politicians, and if this tech is abused, it can be used to create fake videos that look even more realistic.\nThat said, the world of cats may not have to worry about Nvidia\u2019s AI.

The group also conducted online, in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 K-3 teachers.\nOn average, two-thirds of the teachers who were surveyed viewed themselves as \"early-childhood educators.\" The numbers were highest among kindergarten teachers with 93 percent agreeing with that statement, while it dropped to 52 percent among 3rd grade teachers.\nLauren Hogan is NAEYC's senior director of public policy and advocacy. She also managed the polling for this project.\nShe recently discussed the findings with us via email and said they show that the perceived divide between these groups is not as wide as many believe.\n\"My sense from this research is that K-3 teachers want to be attached to and included in 'early-childhood education' because they understand that it's about a child's development across multiple domains\u2014cognitive, social-emotional, physical, etc.\u2014and they know how much the young kids they work with need and will thrive with that developmentally appropriate approach,\" wrote Hogan.\nThe survey also found that 76 percent of K-3 teachers supported the creation of a unified and aligned system of early-childhood education from birth to age 8.\nHogan said by working together these groups would be able to accomplish a lot because voters view K-12 teachers as trustworthy sources of information.\n\"If they were to come together more consistently with educators of children 0-5 around a shared message of the critical need to invest in early-childhood education, it would be very powerful indeed,\" wrote Hogan.\nThose surveyed indicated that a unified and aligned system has several potentially important outcomes such as more developmentally appropriate standards for students (92 percent) and higher wages for teachers (88 percent).\nKindergarten teachers showed the most support for a unified system with 87 percent in favor of it. But that support drops off significantly among 2nd and 3rd grade teachers to 71 and 69 percent respectively.\nThe survey also questioned the teachers about their thoughts on preparation programs. A small majority (54 percent) thought early-childhood educators should be required to have a four-year degree.\nNearly 90 percent of those surveyed viewed their pre-service training as \"excellent\" or \"pretty good.\" Of those who rated their preparation as \"excellent,\" 35 percent were certain they would stay in the profession. Only 24 percent of those who rated their preparation as \"pretty good\" said the same, and that number dropped to 21 percent of those who rated their preparation as \"only fair/poor.\"\nHogan said she found that correlation intriguing and wanted to know if teachers who described their training as excellent were more likely to remain in the profession long-term or if excellent training could influence a teacher's commitment to the classroom.\n\"I think we know a lot about how much retention matters\u2014for a teacher's own quality of teaching, to the relationships they are able to develop with students, to school and community stability\u2014and it's helpful to think broadly about what we can do, from the start of a career all the way through the end, in order to help great teachers keep teaching,\" wrote Hogan.\nThe survey was conducted"}

Now that another prominent Port Charles resident has been attacked, catching the murderer is more important than ever.\nJordan Ashford (Briana Nicole Henry) suggested if they find the shoe that made the bloody footprint, they\u2019ll have their killer. She\u2019ll be eager to track it down, but Ava took the bagged shoes home to exchange them for slippers. Will Ava open the bag and get a shock? If so, this could make her rethink a few things about the man in her life.\nGeneral Hospital spoilers say Ava might develop suspicions, but she may ultimately brush them off. She won\u2019t want to believe the one person who truly cares about her could do something so horrible.\nAva has been warned about Dr. Kevin Collins\u2019 previous psychotic break, but she\u2019s seen no signs of it firsthand. She only knows a doting and kind \u201cKevin,\u201d so she may be looking for another explanation.\nAva might even mention the blood to Ryan, but he could play dumb and suggest he must\u2019ve stepped in it in the elevator. Lulu Falconeri (Emme Rylan) was bleeding in there just before Ryan entered, so it\u2019d be a reasonable explanation.\nHowever, this should be a pivotal moment in Ava\u2019s journey to the truth. Now that suspicions are surfacing, there\u2019ll be thousand little ways for Ryan to trip himself up.\nGeneral Hospital spoilers suggest that like Anna Devane (Finola Hughes), Ryan\u2019s vision will be restored. That means Ryan can get up to his old tricks again. He\u2019ll most likely try to finish Lulu off in her hospital room at GH.\nGeneral Hospital buzz says that Ryan will pretend to still be blind after his sight is restored. This will make the perfect cover for him to slip into Lulu\u2019s room and turn off her life support!\nOf course, the pressure will also get worse thanks to Ryan\u2019s errors. If he makes another mistake, Ava will surely notice. Ryan\u2019s fun could be over in an instant if he faces Ava\u2019s wrath!\nWill Ava be the one to crack the case?

This is about the direction of our government. Now that the elation over electing a black man president seems to be subsiding, I hope people can look at this thing realistically.\nI'm happy Barack Obama won the election. Personally, I feel there was no other reasonable choice. Forget about the fact that Obama is black. His candidacy offered the most practical alternative to the nation's present political course. And right now, we're headed to hell in a hand basket, and most Americans don't have a clue.\nObama ran a campaign that promised to consider how people in other parts of the world see things. He promises to talk to those other folks. I think that is where our government should go. Not everyone believes as we do, and when we fail to consider how other people think, it costs us dearly.\nThe Bush administration has only served the needs of corporate America and its military industrial complex \u2014 which happens to bring our children home from Afghanistan and Iraq maimed or in body bags \u2014 and the American public has allowed itself to be misled with buzzwords like terrorism and patriotism. Prejudice and stupidity are exploited with smoke and mirrors.\nThe war and the nation's recessive economy are residual effects of a government hell-bent on protecting special interests at the expense of American citizens. I'm amazed that so many people actually thought there was an option other than electing an Obama administration to countermand the continuation of the present course.\nOne McCain supporter told me he voted for his military veteran peer because Obama's campaign represented a dangerous shift toward socialism. I asked him what he thinks the billions in crop subsidies paid to farmers or the money the administration just appropriated to the banking industry should be called.\nIn my opinion, the Obama administration represents a departure from politics as usual, and not a dramatic change. How can there be wholesale change in our government when we've re-elected the same fools who have run the government the past decade or more back into office? Obama, however, will offer a different kind of leadership than those clowns in Congress.\nState Sen. Robert Ford said because the political hierarchy that has existed in Washington, D.C. before Obama's election remains in place, it's unrealistic to expect wholesale change in our government. I don't often agree with Ford these days, but in this case I do.\nBefore the election former state Sen. Herbert Fielding told me he was optimistic about the potential of the Obama administration since the Democratic Party likely would remain in control of both Congress and the Senate. I found the thought to be a disappointment because the Democratic Party has been an approving partner to the current administration.\nMcCain easily won South Carolina, and South Carolinians sent a Republican majority back to the State House, indications that most voters in the Palmetto State remain stuck in the \"conservative\" mind-set that launched the Civil War.\nSo what should we expect from an Obama administration? State Rep. David Mack told me Obama's campaign has shined a light on the future of America and that light woke up a lot of people who want to see this nation fulfill its promise of freedom and equality.\nWhile Obama's administration likely will be unable to substantially change how our government responds to the needs of its constituents, it will implement new approaches to how our government operates, and that in turn will begin the process of change. And to do that, the folks awakened by the"}

{"idx": "18647", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Full disclosure, I used it in my student days, but cannabis only ever made me sleepy and a bit queasy so it\u2019s not my cup of tea. That said, it still enjoys a huge popularity in our country.\nThe fact is we aren\u2019t ever going to stop people using it, so I\u2019ve come to the view, and it\u2019s one shared by my party, that the problem is not so much its widespread use, but rather its legal status. It takes up a great deal of police time and space in our prisons; the black market for its production is sustained by hidden farms often tended by children trafficked to this country; and we\u2019re potentially denying the Treasury a king\u2019s ransom in lost duty and taxes currently enjoyed in the more permissive regions of North America.\nIt\u2019s readily available in our communities, certainly, but the cold irony is that the one place you can\u2019t get hold of it is arguably where it matters most and that\u2019s in our pharmacies. Cannabis and its derivatives can have unparalleled qualities in terms of pain relief, muscle relaxation or the suppression of nausea, but largely because of our puritanical national approach to cannabis, the NHS does not license these products. This makes me angry, particularly when that reality denies a proven therapy to someone like my constituent, Murray Gray.\nMurray is five. In his short life he has endured countless, violent seizures due to a rare form of epilepsy, and they\u2019re getting worse. His doctors have tried the full range of available treatments and therapies, but the only thing that makes a difference to Murray is cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Yet, for Murray and those like him, it is put largely out of reach because of the fact that Scottish Government and NHS Scotland won\u2019t approve a license for its use.\nHis mum, Karen, has started a petition to have CBD oil prescribed on the NHS and she joins the family of six-year-old Alfie Dingley from Warwickshire who are campaigning for CBD to be licensed by NHS England. To my mind, people shouldn\u2019t have to fight for something that doesn\u2019t cost a fortune and is proven to make them better.\nWhat\u2019s ludicrous about this is that the purchase and use of CBD is legal, you just have to get hold of it yourself with whatever resources you have, and then find a private health care professional to advise you on the dosage and safe use.\nIt has offered the hope of a more stable and predictable future to patients like Murray and their families, but that\u2019s a hope which is currently being denied to them by NHS Scotland and the Scottish Government.\nThe powers of the Scottish Parliament do not stretch to determining the legality of otherwise of drugs, but we can control the criminal justice response to their use and the licensing of their derivatives for medical use.\nFor all of the reasons outlined above, I believe it\u2019s time to re-examine the laws and rules attached to cannabis in both parliaments.\nTo that end I\u2019ve co-signed a cross-party letter calling for a new, national conversation on controlled substances and the national policy landscape around them.\nFor me that starts with the humane and scientifically supported decision to license cannabinoid therapies like CBD for use through the National Health Service.\nMurray, Alfie and countless others like them are looking to Scotland\u2019s decision makers for hope and a change in the rules."}

Now the rebel leader is a de facto prisoner in a farmhouse outside of Johannesburg. Far from home and isolated from his friends and family, he is also being frozen out of South Sudan\u2019s peace process \u2013 and the future of his country.\nEven his wife, Angelina Teny, can\u2019t speak to him regularly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stay in touch,\u201d she said, speaking from Washington DC in a telephone interview with the Mail & Guardian.\n\u201cEven though the South Africans continue to deny it, it is definitely like a house arrest. Dr Machar is in a situation where he cannot meet anybody at will, he cannot go anywhere at will, he cannot go outside the country at will. His only contacts with the South African authorities is through a couple of individuals. Up to date as we speak he has not met any of the South African leaders since he [arrived]. It is a confinement. He\u2019s not free,\u201d she said.\nIt is a staggering fall from grace for a man who has long dominated South Sudanese politics. Machar was an instrumental figure in South Sudan\u2019s fight for independence from Sudan, and has served as vice-president twice in the very short history of the world\u2019s newest nation. It became independent in 2011.\nHe was an architect of South Sudan\u2019s creation, but also of its downfall. Among other factors, tensions between him and President Salva Kiir sparked the bloody civil war that began in 2013 and rages on today, leaving the country devastated in its wake.\nA new outbreak of fighting in July 2016 destroyed a tentative peace deal that had restored Machar to his government post, and forced him to flee the country. With limited options, Machar ended up in South Africa, where he thought he had friends in high places.\nBut, instead of supporting Machar\u2019s claim to power, the South African government has placed Machar under what amounts to house arrest. Now he can\u2019t even make a phone call without permission.\nA few months ago, the Mail & Guardian reached him on a South African number. \u201cI can\u2019t talk. I have to ask South Africa first,\u201d said the usually loquacious Machar, before hanging up. His cellphone number now goes straight to voicemail.\nMachar\u2019s family and close associates report similar difficulties getting in touch. \u201cHe\u2019s not being allowed to leave South Africa. We can\u2019t speak to him directly. It\u2019s difficult to contact him directly on his phone,\u201d said Lam Paul Gabriel, a Uganda-based spokesperson for Machar\u2019s party, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO).\nA spokesperson for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also the special envoy for South Sudan, echoed this sentiment almost verbatim.\nSources confirmed to the M&G that Machar\u2019s passport was confiscated by the South African government, and has subsequently been revoked by South Sudan, in effect leaving him stateless; and that he is allowed only irregular access to a telephone and medical attention.\nEven some representatives from international organisations involved in mediation in South Sudan have been denied access.\nDesperate to make contact with his party, on one occasion Machar allegedly faked a medical issue so he could meet an associate at a doctor\u2019s practice.\nIn his only public comment on his situation, in a statement released in May, Machar urged the United Nations to \u201cend the international policy of isolating the SPLM-IO"}

{"idx": "18657", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Susanna Styron's documentary explores the neurological disorder known as migraine, which afflicts nearly a billion people worldwide.\nDirector/screenwriter Susana Styron had a very personal reason to make a film about the debilitating effects of migraines. Her daughter Emma is a chronic sufferer, having experienced her first migraine attack when she was just 14 years old. Helping Emma struggle with the condition spurred the filmmaker to explore the subject in Out of My Head, her informative and engrossing documentary receiving its world premiere in a theatrical engagement as part of the Museum of Modern Art's Doc Fortnight 2018.\nIn case you were wondering what Virginia Woolf, Thomas Jefferson, Georgia O'Keefe and Thomas Jefferson had in common, it's that they all suffered from migraines. Among the notables currently afflicted is writer Joan Didion, seen in the film reading from In Bed, her essay about the subject.\n\"When I say a headache, I don't mean just a headache,\" she reads. \"I mean something that would totally brutalize you.\"\nThe documentary includes commentary by numerous doctors and academics, one of whom describes a migraine as a \"neurological disorder.\" Among the symptoms it can produce are a visual abnormality known as an \"aura,\" which several of the sufferers who've experienced it attempt vainly to describe; aphasia, the inability to express or understand language, the dramatic effects of which are demonstrated in footage of a television reporter experiencing the condition during a live broadcast; and headaches, of the truly severe, debilitating variety. Fortunately, the doc's dense torrent of clinical information is alleviated by charming animated interludes created by Maya Edelman.\nAmong the film's interview subjects are a family in which the husband, wife and teenage daughter all experience regular migraines (\"It makes for a very tense household,\" he comments); a woman whose husband became a migraine cure activist; and a man whose migraine attacks were disbelieved by his work colleagues who thought that the condition only affected women.\nThere is no definitive cure for migraines, with one doctor describing his goal as bringing his patients \"from an unbearable pain to a bearable pain.\" The illness is problematic because it becomes resistant to medications, with the result that doctors have to engage in \"trial and error\" medicine.\nThe documentary also explores the influence that migraines have had in culture, from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (for which \"Alice in Wonderland syndrome\" is named) to the art and writings of Hildegard Von Bingen, the Catholic saint who claimed to have experienced visions starting when she was very young.\nNot surprisingly, the doc strongly advocates for increased funding for research into migraines, which is currently woefully inadequate. It also notes that there are approximately only 500 certified headache specialists in the country, resulting in a staggering ratio of one doctor for roughly every 76,000 patients.\nOut of My Head feels a bit padded despite its brief running time, featuring such unnecessary scenes as one of the families meeting with Congressman John Lewis, who of course promises to do all he can for their cause. But that's a forgivable flaw in this heartfelt documentary shedding much-needed light on a too often misunderstood condition."}

He also faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault and is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after being flown from Afghanistan a few days after the killings.\nTwo senior U.S. officials told CNN that Bales sneaked off his remote outpost twice during his alleged rampage, entering one village during each trip.\nOne U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation said an Afghan guard allegedly spotted Bales leaving his outpost around 1 a.m. It is not clear why Bales' superiors weren\u2019t alerted, and the official said Bales was not noticed when he allegedly returned to the compound an hour later.\nDuring the roughly 30 minutes when he was on the base, he woke at least one roommate and claimed he had been killing Afghan civilians off the base, which his roommate dismissed as nonsense, the official said, according to CNN\u2019s Nick Paton Walsh.\nThe official said a different Afghan guard saw Bales leave the base a second time. He alerted his command that someone had left the outpost, and U.S. troops formed a search party, according to the official.\nAbout 3:30 a.m., the official said, a surveillance camera spotted Bales returning to the base, and the search team found him just outside the compound.\nAfghan guards also told reporter Yalda Hakim of Australia\u2019s SBS network that Bales left twice.\nThe U.S. official said Bales was supposed to have been on duty guarding the base that night and would have had full body armor and weaponry as standard.\nU.S. officials haven\u2019t suggested any motive in the slayings.

And the brand-new 2020 Outback that debuts at the New York Auto Show this week offers updates that broaden the model's appeal without straying from that charming formula.\nFor starters, the 2020 Outback now rides on Subaru's global platform, which underpins the Ascent, Crosstrek, Forester, Impreza and redesigned 2020 Legacy, the latter of which largely forms the basis for this redesigned wagon. The new Outback isn't much larger than its predecessor, but Subaru says the structure is significantly stiffer than before.\nOn the powertrain front, the big news is the return of a turbocharged engine option. In its higher XT trims, the Outback uses the 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four engine from the Ascent and Legacy, tuned to produce 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. Paired with a continuously variable transmission, Subaru estimates fuel economy numbers of 23 miles per gallon city and 30 mpg highway with this engine, plus the ability to tow up to 3,500 pounds.\nNon-XT models will use Subaru's 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four engine, with 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. This engine is slightly more efficient, with Subaru estimating fuel economy of 26 mpg city and 33 mpg highway. As with the turbo engine, the 2.5-liter H4 is paired with a continuously variable transmission and all-wheel drive.\nSubaru says the 2020 Outback has a number of improved suspension components that ought to make it more enjoyable to drive. Should you want to venture off the beaten path, the Outback offers 8.7 inches of ground clearance -- the same as before -- and all models get the company's X-Mode function with hill-descent control.\nThe highlight of the interior is a new, 11.6-inch touchscreen.\nInside, the new Outback gets a massive tech upgrade, by way of the 11.6-inch, portrait-oriented infotainment display, which is standard on all but the base trim level. This new touchscreen runs an updated version of the automaker's Starlink infotainment system, with optional TomTom-based navigation and a new app called Chimani (which kind of sounds like a granola-based snack), which gives detailed information about all 417 national parks in the US -- how appropriately Subaru.\nWhether you get the big touchscreen or opt for the base model, every 2020 Outback comes standard with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth audio and over-the-air updates.

However, that doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test since the EPA formally reviewed this unspecified incident years ago and did not consider it disqualifying to his employment at the agency.\nSo that Caraballo\u2019s termination will not be in vain, let\u2019s talk about the report! The report looked at the supposed threats that Pruitt cited to beef up his security detail, and considered there to be no credible death threats made against him.\nDemocratic Senators who reviewed the material said the Secret Service heard no chatter about threats against Pruitt\u2019s life, and the EPA\u2019s own internal documents repeatedly failed to justify the security spending.\nGiven Pruitt\u2019s pro-corporate, anti-environment approach to running the EPA, there\u2019s no doubt that people are going to be critical of his work. To construe this criticism as a death threat is ridiculous, particularly in light of Pruitt risking issuing a death sentence on the people of the planet by refusing to address climate change and the legitimate threats it poses.\nHopefully, Caraballo\u2019s firing will be added to the list of Pruitt\u2019s other ethical concerns. He\u2019s already been caught demoting and reassigning EPA staffers who stand up to his corruption and misspending, so this latest example seems right in line.\nAlthough it\u2019s likely that Pruitt sacked Caraballo as a warning to those who defy or seek to undermine him, an anonymous EPA staffer told Politico that doing this would backfire.\nWe all know who the real individual that deserves to be fired from the EPA is \u2013 and he\u2019s right at the top. In light of his total lack of ethics, it\u2019s time for Pruitt to get fired. Call on President Donald Trump to get rid of this wasteful administration by signing this Care2 petition.\nPruitt has been assigned to the EPA expressly to destroy it and nullify it. As have all the other appointments to all the other agencies that are important to our health welfare and safety, such as DeVoss and others. Neither Trump nor any of the GOP will do anything to remove Pruitt, he is doing exactly what they want.\nSigned; this clown is as unethical, inept, unqualified, greedy and egocentric as the infant in chief. They deserve each other; the people do not.\nRight, you wouldn't want to report on any of the Greedy Old Predators in Trump's admonistration....... that would not be an act of loyalty to a \"Liar in Charge\"!! Pruitt should be fired, just like Price and the rest of the grabbers of taxpayer $$$$.\nSigned petition. Pruitt"}

Portland's original cannabis festival is back at Waterfront Park, after another year of contentious back-and-forth with city officials, still struggling to abide by Portland's pot laws.\nBut there is one big difference in 2015 - recreational cannabis is now legal across Oregon.\nFestival founder Paul Stanford said that meant they could take it easy, cut back on the city-mandated security and even open a fenced-off smoking area for people to consume cannabis at the event, but the reality on Hempstalk's opening day Saturday turned out to be a little different than organizers imagined.\nLong lines snaked out of the fenced-in smoking area - a section of parking lot adjacent to the park, which Stanford said he rented from the city for $2,100 - but by mid-afternoon the party was over, shut down by Portland Police, according to security personnel at the event.\nOrganizers insisted that it was sanctioned by the city, yet found themselves staring at an empty patch of blacktop for tobacco use only.\nThe number of security personnel this year was, however, smaller than last. The crew was down to 20 from last year's 40, but the presence is still much larger than in festivals past, when eight guards would roam the grounds at Kelley Point Park.\nThis year's staff spent Saturday patrolling Waterfront Park, focusing their efforts on vendors in tents lined up on the lawn.\nKen Kovash, owner of local seed bank Quantitative Ginetics, set up jars of flowers grown with his company's seeds, meant only for display. Hempstalk organizers stopped by and told him to pack it all up, claiming police documented somebody selling product from the booth.\n\"It's too bad, we paid $1,000 for this event,\" Kovash said, denying that they had sold anything to anyone. \"I don't see why we can't display flowers that people can grow in their own backyard.\"\nStanford said organizers had also kicked out a California-based seed company earlier in the day for selling. You can buy cannabis from hundreds of stores around the city, but at Hempstalk it's strictly forbidden, a casualty of hosting the event in a public setting.\nDespite legalization, it seems destined to be another year of controversy and confusion at the festival. Still, the Hempstalk faithful had reason to be optimistic.\n\"Last year 90 percent of the people who came to the gate gave up,\" Stanford said, referring to the fenced-in perimeter and bag checks at the gates. \"We don't have that this year and it's a lot better vibe.\"\nThat vibe was decidedly less combative than in years past. The traditional soap-box rants from a stage beside the Hawthorne Bridge have evolved from recreational legalization to societal normalization. And people there seemed far more compliant, with many smoking at a safe distance from the festival proper.\nBut with this newfound normalcy surrounding cannabis consumption, what becomes of a prohibition-era festival like Hempstalk?\n\"It's a process and it's going to continue to evolve,\" Stanford assured. He said he'll always use the event as a place for cannabis activism, and even though recreational and medicinal marijuana are now legal in the Pacific Northwest, he still sees much work to be done.\nHis end goal? To fuel the entire world with hemp.\n\"My"}

The sculpture was rededicated Thursday.\nThe sculpture was first dedicated in 1984. Twenty-five years of weather and millions of visitors\u2019 hands had worn down the finish on the troops\u2019 faces, arms, hands and guns. The worn areas turned a greenish-blue.\nThe statue features three men carrying infantry weapons and Vietnam War-era uniforms that were intentionally designed to be from any branch of the U.S. military, but are often thought to depict a diverse group of two soldiers and a Marine. The figures are looking toward the wall of names.\nIt took six weeks for Baltimore-based New Arts Foundry to complete the restoration. They performed the work on-site, in an enclosure that contained windows so visitors could watch the work in progress.\nThe project was funded by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and the National Park Service. VVMF raised about $125,000 for the work.\nThe restoration is part of a maintenance program the VVMF began last fall to assist NPS with the upkeep of the site. The statue will now undergo regularly scheduled maintenance, including waxing, to preserve the new patina and prevent future damage, foundation officials said.\nThe Three Servicemen statue was not part of the original design for the memorial, but was added to appease critics who thought landscape architect Maya Lin\u2019s design was too abstract. Controversy over the look of the striking, evocative memorial died quickly after its unveiling in 1982.\nThe late artist Frederick Hart had placed third in the memorial design competition and was commissioned to create the statue. The original patina was designed by artist Elliot Gantz and included combinations and gradations of many different colors. Gantz also designed the restoration patina.\nThe statue\u2019s lead soldier was modeled after a 21-year-old Marine who was stationed in the Washington, D.C., area in 1983. The soldier carrying the gun on his shoulder was modeled after a Cuban-American, and the African-American is a composite of several young men used by the sculptor as models, according to the VVMF.\n\"The portrayal of the figures is consistent with history. They wear the uniform and carry the equipment of war; they are young. The contrast between the innocence of their youth and the weapons of war underscores the poignancy of their sacrifice. There is about them the physical contact and sense of unity that bespeaks the bonds of love and sacrifice that is the nature of men at war. And yet they are each alone. Their strength and their vulnerability are both evident. Their true heroism lies in these bonds of loyalty in the face of their aloneness and their vulnerability.\""}

I've been waiting to go in the whole time.\"\nA reservations system is new for the hot springs that always welcomed visitors with a come-one, come-all policy. Richardson says this system is necessary as the facility continues to rebuild and test how many people the resort can hold.\nFaulty outdoor electrical wiring threw sparks in the air and ignited the Valley Fire on the afternoon Sept. 12, 2015, in Lake County. By midnight of that day, Middletown was up in flames and the resort community of Harbin Hot Springs long popular with spiritual seekers was destroyed. The fire continued to rage for an entire month, ripping across 76,00 acres and burning 2,000 structures to the ground.\nWorkshop spaces, guest cottages, massage studios, a wooden temple and residences that housed some 55 people were all lost. Structures that had been built in the 1900s when the site operated as a high-end resort with Turkish baths were scorched to piles ash.

{"idx": "18693", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What happens in the body during a fatal overdose? And why is fentanyl responsible for more deaths than ever?\nOne evening this past fall a patient stumbled into the emergency room at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so\u2026\u201d she muttered, before losing consciousness. Her breathing was shallow and her pupils were pinpoints, typical symptoms of an opioid overdose.\nHer care team sprang into action. They injected her with 0.4 milligram of naloxone, an overdose antidote\u2014but she remained unresponsive. They next tried one milligram, then two, then four. In total they used 12 milligrams in just five minutes, says Edward Boyer, the physician overseeing her care that night. Yet the patient still had trouble breathing. They put a tube down her throat and hooked her to a ventilator. Twenty minutes later she woke up\u2014angry and in drug withdrawal, but alive.\nThe patient, whose identifying details may have been altered to protect patient confidentiality, had apparently injected herself with a synthetic opioid such as fentanyl right outside of the hospital building. That gave her just enough time to seek help. But many users of synthetic opioids are not so lucky. These drugs, which bear little chemical resemblance to any opioid derived from the opium poppy, are much more powerful than poppy-based heroin and semisynthetic opioids such as oxycodone or hydrocodone. Thus, the standard dose of naloxone employed by first responders (and sold in bystander overdose kits) is often not potent enough to save a synthetic opioid user\u2019s life.\nRecent data indicate the rise of these synthetics is proving particularly deadly. Between 2015 and 2016 the rate of reported overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids\u2014meaning fentanyl and similar drugs, as well as the painkiller tramadol\u2014doubled, accounting for about 6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, and contributing to the more than 63,000 deaths from drug overdoses that year.\nBut how do these drugs actually kill people? When a person smokes, snorts or injects an opioid, the substance enters the bloodstream, then the brain. There it can act on mu-opioid receptors, says Eric Strain, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and Research at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cOnce the drug binds to those opioid receptors and activates them, it sets off a cascade of psychological and physical actions; it produces euphoric effects, but it also produces respiratory-depressing effects,\u201d Strain says.\nAs a result, victims of a fatal overdose usually die from respiratory depression\u2014literally choking to death because they cannot get enough oxygen to feed the demands of the brain and other organ systems. This happens for several reasons, says Bertha Madras, a professor of psychobiology at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School. When the drug binds to the mu-opioid receptors it can have a sedating effect, which suppresses brain activity that controls breathing rate. It also hampers signals to the diaphragm, which otherwise moves to expand or contract the lungs. Opioids additionally depress the brain\u2019s ability to monitor and respond to carbon dioxide when it builds up to dangerous levels in the blood. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most diabol"}

Cash-strapped PDVSA is increasingly giving its own crude and products away to obtain some of the barrels its refining network needs.\nRefining problems due to outages and lack of oil have caused intermittent fuel shortages in the OPEC-member nation. The shrinking crude output and exports have not only cut its ability to pay cash for imported oil, but also to buy the food, medicine and supplies the country needs.\nPDVSA\u2019s oil purchases - typically used for refining and blending its heavy crude for export markets - declined to almost none during the second half of last year as the company used most of its cash to pay bondholders and avoid a default.\nPDVSA has received in recent weeks 1.73 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate and DSW crudes, and 1.44 million barrels of Russia\u2019s Urals crude at Curacao\u2019s Bullenbay terminal, according to the PDVSA\u2019s internal data and Reuters vessel tracking data, almost the same volume imported in all of 2017.\nMost imports came from tenders awarded in December to China Oil and trading firm Citizens Resources LLC.\nPDVSA expects to receive two more U.S. crude cargoes from China Oil, owned by state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Sinochem Corp, and two additional Urals cargoes from trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) and Russia\u2019s Lukoil (LKOH.MM), the documents say.\nPDVSA, Citizens Resources, China Oil and Lukoil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Glencore declined to comment.\nPDVSA agreed to prices over $66 per barrel for the crude purchases discharged this year, according to the same documents. The numbers were close to market prices, but still are a heavy load for a country struggling to afford basic goods.\nCash payments for the cargoes have been minimal since PDVSA also has agreed to deliver up to 1 million barrels of fuel oil and 3.9 million barrels of Merey heavy crude in exchange for the imports.\nSuch barter deals have become common in recent years as PDVSA strains to obtain hard currency for its crude. A series of oil-for-loan agreements coupled with falling crude output have left the company cash strapped. In 2017, its oil production fell to the lowest level in almost three decades.\nFinancial sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in August have also worsened its cash problems while limiting access to long- and medium-term credit.\nPDVSA\u2019s Isla refinery in Curacao is one of its main facilities for fuel oil output for exports, but a lack of crude last year limited processing at the plant, causing delays"}

But will the crossword?\nOur crossword editor, Val Gilbert, is uncertain: \"The Telegraph crossword has been going for 81 years and I think it will last a century. Beyond that, I don't know. If you took a train journey 20 years ago, everybody was reading a paper, now people get their news from the television or online. Few have time to sit and think about the crossword.\"\nOur leisure time is undoubtedly spent differently from that of early cruciverbalists. On the June day in 1925 when the first Daily Telegraph crossword was published, typical family entertainment might have included a game of whist or a radio play.\nTelegraph compiler Don Manley says it was the perfect environment for crosswords to flourish. \"I got my love of crosswords from my father; we didn't have a television and we'd sit together all evening solving them,\" he recalls. \"My one sadness is that I haven't managed to pass that love on to my son. There are so many rivals for children's attention now.\"\nAnd while television and the internet mean that younger people don't linger long over the back page, their lack of interest could also stem from a feeling that the clues, especially cryptic ones, require a depth of knowledge in the classics, literature and history that just isn't provided by the national curriculum.\n\"I think the only way we can secure a future for the crossword is to make sure we appeal to a younger audience, too,\" says Manley. \"We need to start writing clues that they would be able to solve. Some are just too obscure.\"\nThis might also explain why sudoku - for which the only background knowledge you need are the numbers one to nine - has such mass appeal. Hazel Norris, Chambers's senior editor of crosswords games and puzzles, says: \"There's been a lot of consternation in crossword circles about sudoku. Some fans think it will mean crosswords will die out, and there's no doubt that it's huge at the moment.\"\nBut she says that the new puzzle isn't the threat that crossword aficionados believe it to be. \"What we're finding is that the sudoku craze is making people realise how gripping puzzles are and leading them to try crosswords for the first time. Sales of crossword dictionaries are as good as ever.\"\nAnd there are other signs that the public is still hungry for the kind of brain teasers that characterise crosswords.

Now Ohio State needs him become a reliable second option.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- For much of the season, Ohio State\u2019s basketball team has relied on one man to provide its offensive production.\n1. That player is a low-post scorer, which forces the offense to spend time trying to simply find ways to just get the ball in his hands.\n2. That low-post player is averaging 3.5 fouls per game and has fouled out of four games already this season.\nWhen Kaleb Wesson leaves the floor, Ohio State\u2019s offense usually leaves with him. Over the past four games, the Buckeyes have found ways to generate offense outside of Wesson, but none of those has been consistent enough to rely on. Wesson may be their best player, but that doesn\u2019t matter if they can\u2019t get him the ball or he\u2019s sitting on the bench.\nBut there is one player who has shown flashes of being the perimeter option the Buckeyes desperately need.\nLuther Muhammad led Ohio State in its 74-70 win over Penn State on Thursday night with a stat line of 20 points, five rebounds and four assists. He made all eight of his free-throw attempts and played 38 minutes without a single turnover.\nThat is what Muhammad is capable of, but the problem is he doesn\u2019t always do it.\nThe last time he reached the 20-point mark, he followed it up with three points on only five shots. He\u2019s only averaging 7.6 shots per game, but makes 45 percent of them and 46 percent of his threes. He doesn\u2019t lack confidence, but sometimes he has to be reminded that what he brings to the table is a necessity and not a bonus.\nMuhammad is Ohio State\u2019s most talented guard, but teams this year seem more focused on his defense. He excels on that end as well and usually draws the assignment of the opposing team\u2019s best perimeter player. Penn State\u2019s Josh Reaves may have ended the game with 20 points, but that didn\u2019t stop Muhammad from trash talking at the times it felt necessary.\nHoltmann said that right now Muhammad is the only guard with the ability and style that would allow him to consistently make plays for himself and others. He added that Duane Washington Jr. \u2014 who added nine points off the bench \u2014 has the potential to get there, but that it comes more naturally to Muhammad.\nFor Muhammad, the challenge isn\u2019t his ability or his confidence level. His biggest challenge will be his willingness to look for his shot. He\u2019s only taken at least 10 or more shots in five games this season, and that will need to change if Ohio State wants to continue its winning ways this month.\nTeams know the Buckeyes want to play through Kaleb Wesson. If they can keep him to just two shots attempts like the Nittany Lions did, opponents will go home satisfied."}

However, there are several other closely related mycobacterial species that cause TB, all part of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc). One of them, Mycobacterium africanum (Maf), causes up to 40% of TB cases in West Africa. TB diagnosis across Africa relies largely on tests optimized to detect Mtb. A study led by the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia and the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine, Belgium, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases now suggests that in West Africa tests to identify Mtbc in culture miss a substantial fraction of cases, with dire consequences for the patients and for TB control efforts.\nConcerned about substantial discrepancies in samples from West Africa between the sputum-based results and the results of rapid tests, Florian Gehre, who is affiliated with MRC and ITM, and colleagues undertook a systematic evaluation of two commonly used rapid TB tests. Both tests detect the product of the mycobacterial mpt64 gene.\nThe researchers started by comparing the abundance of mpt64 gene product in sputum samples of patients with untreated pulmonary TB caused by Maf 2 (the Maf strain common in The Gambia) or Mtb. Samples from five patients with Maf 2 TB, they found, had about 2.5 times less mpt64 gene product than those from six patients whose disease was caused by Mtb.\nThey then prospectively analyzed culture isolates from 173 patients with one of the rapid tests, the BD MGITTM TBc ID kit. All of the patients had positive sputum microscopy, and cultures were negative for a second test that detects contamination by unrelated bacteria. Based on molecular analysis, the researchers knew that 122 of the samples were from patients with Mtb TB; the remaining 51 samples from patients with Maf 2 TB.\n150 of the samples tested positive on Day zero (the day when mycobacterial growth in culture was first recorded), with 23 (13.2%) testing negative at this time point. The accuracy was much higher (over 90%) for the Mtb samples, compared with less than 80% for the Maf 2 samples. The researchers then ran the tests for another 90 days to see whether and when initially negative samples would turn positive (test instructions recommend reading results between Days zero and ten). At Day 10, 84% of Maf 2 samples tested positive compared with 98% of Mtb samples. By Day 90, 98% of both Mtb and Maf 2 samples tested positive.\nBased on these results, 22% of Maf 2 patients, and 10% of Mtb patients would have been wrongly classified as having non-TB mycobacteria if the tests had not been repeated after Day zero. At the end of the 10-day window recommended by the BD MGITTM TBc ID manufacturer, 16% of all Maf 2 samples remained negative, compared with only 2% of Mtb samples.\nThe researchers repeated the same analysis with all samples that had tested negative on Day zero and a random set of those that had tested positive using the SD Bioline Ag MPT64 RapidTM test.

It\u2019s going regional, and focusing on an eclectic mash-up of works by 12 artists with roots in Cleveland and/or the rest of Ohio, Detroit or Pittsburgh.\nThe show, entitled, \"Realization is Better Than Anticipation,\" on view through Oct. 13 in MOCA's hexagonal building at Euclid Avenue and Mayfield Road in University Circle, offers an ample serving of smallish, intriguing objects that pull you in for a close look and reward prolonged scrutiny.\nFor a museum that has less pure gallery space than it did in its prior rented home in Midtown, shows like the current one may represent a winning curatorial strategy in terms of holding a visitor\u2019s attention.\nFor one thing, the show doesn\u2019t lavish an entire gallery on a single large artistic gesture, such as the paint-splattered Gilmore stage, that could have been all-to-easily dismissed by skeptics as not worth more than a quick glance.\nThat kind of knee-jerk would be impossible in MOCA\u2019s new show.\nA still from a raucous Jacob Ciocci video in the new MOCA Cleveland show.\nOrganized by Megan Lykins Reich, MOCA\u2019s director of programs and associate curator, and Rose Bouthillier, MOCA\u2019s assistant curator, the current show attempts to define a regional artistic ethos based on the notion of the well-made object.\nThe theme resonates in a region with a proud history of manufacturing, and it\u2019s true that on a simple, physical level, many of the objects in the show are exquisitely made.\nThe show\u2019s challenge is that the processes involved in the making of art, as embodied in the works on view, are so diverse as to leave one scratching one\u2019s head about whether any true regional identity is, in fact, defined.\nThe strategies employed by the artists range from conceptual to those that are entirely based in the possibility of grappling with specific physical materials. The commonality is that just about everything in the show is gentle, sly, elegant, insouciant, playful and highly intelligent.\nMost of the artists are alive; some have passed on. In any case, it\u2019s impossible to imagine that they ever would have formed an affinity group of any kind. They\u2019re just too diverse.\nThe group includes the Rev. Albert Wagner of East Cleveland, a visionary, self-trained outsider who died in 2006 at age 82, and whose primitive, folksy paintings of religious visions earned him a national following.\nHe\u2019s represented by some terrific sculptures made by combining shattered fragments of trees with a stray kitchen pot or pan.

Miller added a potential prebiotic condensation agent, cyanamide, during the course of the experiment. Cyanamide has been suggested to induce polymerization of amino acid into simple peptides which is an important set in chemical evolution and possibly the origin of life. For unknown reasons, Miller had never analyzed the samples. In a paper published in 2014, researchers at Georgia Tech and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego analyzed the samples and established the potential importance of reagents - substances that cause chemical reactions such as cyanamide - in the origin of life on Earth.\nClose-up of the spark that simulates the energy provided by lightning on the early Earth.\nNewswise \u2014 Stanley Miller, the chemist whose landmark experiment published in 1953 showed how some of the molecules of life could have formed on a young Earth, left behind boxes of experimental samples that he never analyzed. The first-ever analysis of some of Miller\u2019s old samples has revealed another way that important molecules could have formed on early Earth.\nThe study discovered a path from simple to complex compounds amid Earth\u2019s prebiotic soup. More than 4 billion years ago, amino acids could have been attached together, forming peptides. These peptides ultimately may have led to the proteins and enzymes necessary for life\u2019s biochemistry, as we know it.\nIn the new study, scientists analyzed samples from an experiment Miller performed in 1958. To the reaction flask, Miller added a chemical that at the time wasn\u2019t widely thought to have been available on early Earth. The reaction had successfully formed peptides, the new study found. The new study also successfully replicated the experiment and explained why the reaction works.\n\u201cIt was clear that the results from this old experiment weren\u2019t some sort of artifact. They were real,\u201d said Jeffrey Bada, distinguished professor of marine chemistry at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the UC San Diego.

The master limited partnership increased its already large bet on natural gas as it announced it was spending $278 million to buy natural gas focused properties in North Louisiana and East Texas. The deal adds 23,000 net acres and currently produces 17.5 MMcfe per day, with 67% of that production being dry natural gas, and the rest natural gas liquids and oil.\nVanguard Natural Resources has really focused on acquiring natural gas properties over the past four years. That's a different approach from most of its peers, which have really backed off natural gas as the price remains well off the highs it hit in 2008 as the following chart notes.\nPlunging natural gas prices have caused many producers to simply give up on drilling for gas. These producers are also selling off mature natural gas properties in order to reinvest the cash into higher valued oil and natural gas liquids properties. Vanguard Natural Resources, on the other hand, has been a willing buyer of these properties because it's getting the natural gas reserves in the ground at fire sale prices. As the chart in the right-hand side of the following slide notes, Vanguard Natural Resources has been especially aggressive in acquiring natural gas properties in the years since the price of natural gas plunged.\nSource: Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC Investor Presentation (link opens a PDF).\nOver this time, Vanguard Natural Resources has really transformed its portfolio into one that's focused on natural gas. In 2011, just 34% of its reserves were natural gas, however, just two years later, its reserves were 67% natural gas. The shift is due to its focus on value, as natural gas properties are being sold for a better value than oil properties. In addition to value, Vanguard Natural Resources is also picking up a long-term option on the price of natural gas as its profits will head higher if natural gas prices heat up. It's quite the opposite approach of peers like BreitBurn Energy Partners (NASDAQOTH:BBEPQ), which has really focused its efforts to boost its oil reserves. In fact, BreitBurn Energy Partners recently announced it was acquiring an oil-focused rival, which makes the combined entity the largest oil-weighted upstream MLP.\nThis focus on acquiring natural gas assets impacts the company's dividend, or distributions, in two ways. First, by acquiring less expensive natural gas assets, Vanguard Natural Resources can achieve greater initial accretion to its distributable cash flow for the same amount of capital. Greater cash flow accretion means the company has the ability to boost its dividend at a higher rate right from the start than if it would have acquired an oil-rich property.\nIn addition to that, because the company is acquiring long-lived natural gas properties, it holds a long-term option on the prices of natural gas. The company's latest deal included reserves that have an estimated reserve life of 23 years. That's a long time, and because time is on its side, it can wait for the fundamentals of the natural gas market to shift in its favor. In fact, as the following slide notes, there are several compelling reasons natural gas prices could heat up in the future.\nAs that slide noted, natural gas demand growth is expected to outstrip supply growth through 2018"}

We need to wean ourselves off gas taxes, not increase them.\nConcerns about double taxation \u2014 payment of gas taxes at the pump and tolls on the road \u2014 are understandable, but easily addressed. Modern technology makes it easy to rebate fuel taxes paid by drivers on electronically tolled roads. This should satisfy concerns about double-charging users.\n\u2022 Gottlieb contends that tolling is \u201cwasteful and inefficient,\u201d and suggests 23 cents of every dollar collected in tolls will be spent on building and operating the system.\nThis is a familiar criticism. The American Trucking Associations claims that toll collection costs eat up 20% to 30% of toll revenue. That may have been true of all-cash 20th century tolling, but is no longer true today. A 2016 report from the Congressional Research Service found average U.S. toll collection costs requiring 8% to 11% of toll revenue. But even those numbers are dominated by large, legacy toll roads that have only begun the transition from cash to electronic tolling.\nA peer-reviewed Reason Foundation study by electronic tolling experts found that toll roads using only electronic toll collection and streamlined business rules have collection costs between 4% and 9%. Those researchers suggested that 5% of toll revenue was an achievable target once all-electronic tolling is fully phased in.\nThe fact is that we need more revenue to prevent widespread deterioration of our roads. Unless something is done, Wisconsin\u2019s infrastructure will become an increasing drag on state economic growth. A policy study just released by the Reason Foundation ranked each state\u2019s highway system by 11 different categories. Ranking the Best, Worst, Safest, and Most Expensive State Highway Systems \u2014 The 23rd Annual Highway Report gave Wisconsin an overall rank of 38th in highway performance and cost-effectiveness.\nThere are no viable solutions other than tolling.\nRevenue from gas taxes will slowly disappear in the years to come. More debt is not the answer either. Over 20% of all transportation fund revenues are already used for debt service rather than improving our roads. All told, we spend over half a billion per year just servicing transportation-related debt.\nLet the people who use the roads pay for them. Tolling is fair, quick and convenient.

The second, more important lesson was that when somebody asks if they can be your friend, the answer should always be \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 because nothing truly important is achieved without others. It\u2019s not just that they need your support, you need theirs to get a job done well.\nAnd today, as a CMO-turned-CEO with a host of media channels to befriend, the lessons ring truer and louder than ever because the job at hand is to help businesses and their brands grow. In 2018, marketers must be discerning and optimise their media mix according to the task in front of them.\nWe know media selection isn\u2019t a simple, binary choice. We know it takes a cocktail of media channels to move consumers through the path-to-purchase to grow brands and businesses. ThinkTV exists to provide advertisers and their agencies with facts and data about the effectiveness of video advertising to ensure they have what they need to make good decisions about their media mix.\nAlong the way we have unearthed evidence about TV\u2019s ability to effectively drive business outcomes. We believe the relative effectiveness of every media platform is central to the choices marketers make about their media mix. TV is a very powerful advertising platform for marketers, and a multitude of studies show TV has a multiplier effect when deployed with other media. But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 look to the independent experts who have been at this a lot longer than ThinkTV.\nLes Binet, one of the planet\u2019s most revered marketing minds, spoke at the Agency Leader\u2019s Symposium in the Hunter Valley in September about how media works better when it works together. As Binet\u2019s awesome chart below shows, brands that use of a combination of video platforms generate the most growth.\nBinet and his fellow \u201cGodfather of Ad Effectiveness\u201d, Peter Field, found brands that use TV only get more than double the average market share gains (per annum) of those that use only online video.\nThey also identified the magic \u201cfriendship\u201d multiplier, where adding online video to the mix makes TV work almost 20 per cent harder.\nIt\u2019s no news that the real work of advertisers and their media agencies is to determine the optimal split of media channels in order to deliver to a specific objective. Advertisers have a multitude of considerations when determining that mix. How quickly do you need to see a sales impact? Is the brand in a brand-safe environment? Is the ad visible? Is the ad viewable to completion? Do you need the sound on? Do you need the media effect to work long after the ad has aired?\nProfessor Karen-Nelson Field\u2019s work on The Benchmark Series shows TV stacks up very well against all these variables. That\u2019s not to say TV is the only media channel required, but rather to provide insights into the strengths of a channel that has been a great mate to marketers for more than 60 years.\nSo, if you want to know if TV is your friend, we think it\u2019s a pretty definitive \u201cyes\u201d.

In response, the tree has evolved ever-thicker cone scales. And the South Hills crossbill evolves a bigger bill. And the tree responds. And on and on through the millennia.\nThat\u2019s not the weird bit. Species evolving together like this is known as coevolution. Happens all the time. The weird bit is that the South Hills crossbill may have speciated without geographic isolation\u2014which is sort of problematic for traditional evolutionary theory. Because while the South Hills crossbill was diverging from other crossbills, it did so while those other crossbills were freely flying through its territory, according to a study published today in Molecular Ecology. That adds to a growing body of evidence that in certain fascinating cases, you may not need geographic isolation to get a new species, challenging what was long gospel among many evolutionary biologists. Gasp\u2014I know.\nSouthern Idaho, where the South Hills crossbill makes its home.\nTypically to get something to speciate, you have to isolate the animal, say, on an island. Over time, an animal species will diverge genetically from its compatriots on the mainland, since it can\u2019t breed with them and mix genes. You can also get this phenomenon on the mainland, if, for example, a new river cuts through an ecosystem, dividing a population in two.\nHow on Earth, then, did the South Hill crossbill end up diverging genetically and largely stop breeding with other crossbills in the absence of isolation? It wasn\u2019t a new river that transformed this ecosystem in southern Idaho: It may have been a bigger phenomenon.\n\u201cIt turns out in the South Hills, based on the pollen fossil record, based on our forest reconstructions, there was probably very little lodgepole pine forest about 5,000 to 7,000 years ago,\u201d says Benkman. That changed when the climate began to warm and the conifers moved in. Yet squirrels\u2014a crossbill\u2019s major competitor for pine seeds\u2014never followed.

The answer might be a certain avian quirk: Birds are totally cliquey. Crossbills flock together year-round. They watch each other and talk to each other to assess the quality of their food. And a flock has a characteristic tone that changes subtly over the generations. It\u2019s a kind of secret code that individuals use to find food and mates.\nSo say a population settles into the lodgepole pine forest and develops a variant call. \u201cBasically, that call will just take off and be favored,\u201d Benkman says. \u201cAnd given that they flock year-round and"}

One of the decisions you have to make is whether to go with a cantilever or corner-post angled-deck design. The size or height of your deck will likely dictate this selection. With that choice nailed down, you\u2019ll have a good idea of your order of battle for installing your deck posts.\nScope out the planned site for your octagonal deck and sketch a provisional design on graph paper or with software. For either a large deck or a low-profile, ground-hugging deck without railings, designate support posts flanking each corner of the octagon in what is called the corner-post design. For a smaller deck, switch to the more affordable and easier-to-construct cantilever design. The latter relies for its infrastructure on a single beam supported by a simple row of posts, each spaced about 6 feet apart.\nCheck with your local building permits office on requirements for decks. You may need to have your plans stamped by an architect or engineer, unless you want to build a low-profile deck. Obtain your permit for a taller deck with railings; this process verifies that the locations of your posts, typically marked by X's surrounded by circles, will safely carry the weight of your deck and its users.\nStake the locations of your concrete footings. If you are creating a corner-post design, first set up a template for your octagonal frame on the ground by nailing together batter boards in a large square. Place additional batter boards at 45-degree angles at each corner to create the octagon. Place stakes flanking each of these corners to mark the locations of concrete footings. For a cantilever deck, simply measure out from your ledger board and set stakes according to your building plan to locate the footings.\nDig the holes for your footings, set concrete form tubes in the holes and fill them with concrete. Set J bolts in the wet concrete. After the concrete sets, set post anchors on top of the J bolts.

{"idx": "18755", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Displaying low- and high-margin items together can increase sales of low-margin items.\nProfit margin calculations assess the financial health and efficiency of both small and large businesses. Gross profit margin, a measure of profit based on sales and the cost of goods sold, is the most common profit margin calculation. Because it pertains to the business as a whole, however, it provides only high-level information. Business owners can use blended gross profit margin as a tool to make well-informed department, product line and product-level decisions.\nBlended gross profit margin calculations take gross profit margin one step further. Gross profit margin calculations are useful for determining profitability, assessing overall costs and determining the break-even point of the business as a whole. Blended gross profit margin calculations provide the detail you need not only to determine profitability and assess costs and break-even points for departments, product lines and individual products within the business but also to create effective pricing strategies and make inventory decisions.\nStart by creating a chart for two or more competing products, using \u201cProduct,\u201d \u201cSales Revenue,\u201d \u201cCost of Goods Sold,\u201d \u201cGross Profit Margin\u201d and \u201cGross Profit\u201d as column labels. Enter product names and total sales revenues over a specific period of time. Calculate and enter the cost of goods sold -- inventory costs minus any vendor discounts plus sales labor expense. Divide the cost of goods sold by total sales revenue to get the gross profit margin. Finally, multiply the gross profit margin by total sales revenue to get a gross profit amount for each product. Calculate the blended gross profit margin for the group by adding the totals for all sales revenues and gross profit amounts and then dividing total gross profit by total sales revenue. Create a separate chart and follow the same process to calculate the blended gross profit margin for two or more product lines and/or departments.\nData analysis starts by reviewing each chart created to get an overview of the data it contains. Because the process starts by calculating information for two or more separate departments, product lines or products, you can, for example, tell by reviewing the chart which department is the generating the most or the least amount of revenue, which product line has the highest profit margin or which products have the highest cost of goods sold. The blended profit margin itself can signal a need for further analysis and decision-making.\nDecision-making can be less difficult with the information blended gross profit margin calculations provide. Assume, for example, blended gross margin calculations focus on four competing products. Despite the fact that the product with the lowest profit margin is significantly lowering the blended profit margin for the group, it is a brand-name item you cannot discontinue. Decisions regarding the low-margin product can include cutting costs, perhaps by negotiating with a vendor for a bigger discount. You can attempt to boost sales of the low-margin product by displaying it next to a high-margin product, such as displaying a blouse and a scarf together or placing a picture on a menu that includes a dessert with a meal. If the product is not mission-critical, calculations can also tell you whether raising the price of the item is an option or if discontinuing a low-margin product is best for the profit margin of the group as a whole.\nLohrey, Jackie. \"What Is a Blended Gross Profit Margin?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/blended-gross-profit-margin-72464.html.

The trial that concluded in a guilty verdict on four of five counts conclusively proved only one thing: A White House aide became the target of a politicized prosecution set in motion by bureaucratic infighting and political cowardice.\n#ad#When partisans pounced on Bob Novak\u2019s July 14, 2003, revelation that the wife of administration critic Joe Wilson worked at the CIA, they adopted Wilson\u2019s paranoid persecution theory. Then a scandal-hungry media joined in. Novak\u2019s unidentified administration sources were widely accused of criminal wrongdoing: having \u201couted\u201d a covert agent.\nThe alleged motive for the leak was to punish Joe Wilson, whose account of his mission to Niger supposedly unmasked the administration\u2019s manufactured case for the war in Iraq. The victim in this set piece was Valerie Plame Wilson, and the villains were Vice President Cheney, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby.\nFrom the very beginning of the ensuing spectacle, petty agendas subverted justice. The CIA, at war with the White House, and in particular with the vice president\u2019s office, referred the leak to the Justice Department, even though the agency certainly knew that there had been no criminal violation since Plame wasn\u2019t \u201ccovert.\u201d (According to the relevant statute, only the leak of a covert agent\u2019s identity is a criminal act.) The CIA\u2019s spokesman had also confirmed Plame\u2019s employment to Novak, without sounding any alarms over the revelation of classified information. The referral to Justice\u2013leaked to the media\u2013was the act of an agency more concerned with shifting the blame for faulty Iraq intelligence than with protecting a supposedly vulnerable agent.\nWith the matter in the Justice Department\u2019s lap, such critics as New York senator Charles Schumer demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor, claiming that then\u2013attorney general John Ashcroft couldn\u2019t oversee the probe because he had a conflict of interest. Even though there was no evidence that the department\u2019s career prosecutors were unable to handle the case, Ashcroft and his top deputy, James Comey, quickly gave in to Schumer\u2019s demands. Comey appointed his friend in Chicago, Patrick Fitzgerald, as the special prosecutor, and gave him even more powers than the old independent counsels had.\nNone of this was a profile in courage on the administration\u2019s part, but the true insanity of the situation was withheld from the public until years later, when we learned that, long before the Justice Department had appointed Fitzgerald, it knew who had leaked to Novak. Early in the investigation, deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage informed investigators that he had told Novak about Mrs. Wilson (although he left out the fact that he had also leaked to the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward). But like the savvy bureaucratic infighter that he is, Armitage kept quiet publicly, allowing the vice president\u2019s office to take the heat for something he had done.\nSo why did Fitzgerald go forward? Maybe someday he\u2019ll tell us, but we\u2019re not betting on it. Reasonable people can conclude that it was only Scooter Libby\u2019s imperfect memory\u2013not willful deception\u2013that gave rise to the charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.

But that's an improvement over the iPhone's past reliability rating.\n\"Twenty-six percent is actually pretty good,\" said Vince Tseng, vice president of marketing at SquareTrade. \"And it's encouraging that the failure rates have decreased.\"\nAccording to SquareTrade, which examined more than 25,000 customer warranty claims, the iPhone 3GS is more reliable, and apparently sturdier too, than its predecessors, the iPhone 3G that first went on sale in July 2008 and the original model, which debuted in 2007.\nLast year, a similar SquareTrade analysis found that 31% of all iPhones failed or were broken during the first 24 months of ownership, compared to today's 25.6% of customers who have owned an iPhone during the last 22 months.\niPhone claims based on both hardware failures and accidents - SquareTrade's warranties covers both - were lower this year compared to 2009. While 21% of iPhone-owning customers reported an accidental damage claim and 10% filed a hardware failure claim in the 24 months preceding last summer, only 18.1% and 7.5% filed an accident or hardware-related claim in the 22 months prior to June 2010.\nPhones kept longer than standard two-year carrier contract, of course, fail at a higher rate. SquareTrade's forecast: Three-year-old iPhones will sport a failure rate of 35%-40%.\nTseng credited improvements that Apple made to the iPhone 3GS's touchscreen for most of the lower number of warranty claim rates in the last 22 months.\n\"The iPhone 3GS is sturdier and can withstand a higher degree of shock,\" said Tseng, referring to the drop in accident claims, the bulk of which are due to dropping the smartphone. \"But the overall reliability of the iPhone has improved, especially in the touchscreen.\"\nThe iPhone 3GS has fewer than half the reported touchscreen problems as the iPhone 3G, SquareTrade's data showed. Overall, Tseng estimated that the iPhone 3GS will have 20% fewer issues than the iPhone 3G.\nOn the downside, iPhone 3GS owners have reported almost 50% more power issues than those with the older iPhone 3G.\nThe past year's improvement in iPhone reliability will likely continue, said Tseng, a good sign for the millions who have ordered the iPhone 4, which Apple will start selling Thursday.\n\"Over the last years, Apple has gotten its manufacturing lines in shape and failure rates have dropped year to year,\" said Tseng. \"The iPhone 4 should be a good, solid device.\"\nBut Tseng has one major worry about the new iPhone: The all-glass back.\nWith the iPhone 4, Apple switched to a glass back, dropping the plastic cover of the iPhone 3G and 3GS.

More is both \"likely and necessary\". \"Likely\" we understand, since commodity prices are falling and China is turning into a basket case before our eyes, while at the same time the US dollar is rising as anxious capital floods into America seeking safety. But why is it \"necessary\"?\nThe most important number for the Australian economy now is not GDP or the cash rate, but the Prime Minister's approval rating - 36 per cent according to the latest poll, down a disastrous 4 percentage points.\nThe political capital of Australia's political leadership has evaporated, largely self-inflicted.\nEconomic reform, already difficult, is now out of the question. A change of government wouldn't help, and won't happen anyway, since the Opposition Leader's approval is even lower than the PM's - 35 per cent.\nThe disappearance of all political capital from both sides of the Parliament is a genuine crisis for the economy because difficult decisions and strong leadership are now required to take the pressure off monetary policy.\nThere are two fundamental, and related, problems that need to be addressed in this country: Australia's cost base is too high and businesses are not investing.\nThe cost base is too high primarily because the price of land has been driven up by investors seeking tax deductions and a safer place for swelling self-managed superannuation balances than the volatile sharemarket.\nIt's exacerbated by the restriction on viable land supply caused by too many regulations and a lack of transport infrastructure and high population growth.\nAustralia's high cost base is one reason businesses are not investing. The other two are political instability that frequently crosses into dysfunction, and the direction of the currency.\nTax reform is entirely off the table, even though a formal process to consider it is pointlessly under way. The Productivity Commission has recommended reforms to superannuation; forget it. Infrastructure investment by government is both minimal and hopelessly politicised. Significant reform of the health and welfare budget is also out of the question, so that the federal budget will be in deficit for at least a decade.\nAll of Australia's necessary economic adjustment following the end of the mining boom must be borne by the currency, which is plain for everyone to see. That in itself leads to a capital drought.\nAfter all, if the central bank of a country comes out and says a devaluation is both likely and necessary, even after a big one (20 per cent) has already happened, where would you invest your money - there or somewhere else?\nAbout the time the Aussie slipped under US74c on Tuesday night, the IMF put out a statement warning of the global consequences of a \"markedly\" stronger US dollar.\nThe report commented: \"A prominent risk to the outlook is that the (US) currency will continue appreciating due to sustained cyclical divergences and capital flows into US dollar"}

The system will allow department and embassy personnel to send messages and reports back and forth electronically and will allow key personnel here and abroad to tap into the department's information bank in Washington.\nEmbassy officials now communicate with their bosses at Foggy Bottom mainly by teleprinter, often an inefficient process. For research and background material, officials outside Washington often must rely on their own sources, newspapers and thinly stocked libraries.\nUnder the new system, an attache in Moscow responsible for helping to plan a summit meeting, for instance, could use a desktop computer to call up and view documents stored in Washington that outline the history and proceedings of previous meetings, none of which the Moscow Embassy would probably have handy.\nMemorandums and electronic mail could also be sent over the system, which will have tight security devices built in.\nBecause much of the material in such cases will be viewed on computer screens rather than printed out, the new system will also reduce the reams of paper telegrams that currently pose floating security risks.\nThe computer project started last year, and how quickly it continues to develop hinges somewhat on future budgets. But if the present schedule holds, the State Department will begin installing new machines in its Washington offices later this year and overseas in another two years or so.\n''The objective is to provide policy makers with more complete information to make decisions more quickly and efficiently,'' said Day O.

The Very Best of Prince jumped by 10,872 percent and Purple Rain came up by 3,101 percent. Overall, Prince\u2019s discography, which is only available for streaming through TIDAL, saw an increase of 5,298 percent in sales after moving 256,000 units.\nThe Purple One didn\u2019t just have the No. 1 and No. 2 albums this week. He also had a third project, The Hits/The B-Sides, in the top 10. That effort reached No. 6.\nThis is somewhat surprising because it all happened so relatively quickly. Prince died on the final day of tracking for this week, meaning his impact was made in a short span of time. His death is expected to impact next week\u2019s chart as well.\nWith this chart appearance, Prince became the first act with both the No. 1 and No. 2 position in the same week in over 10 years. The previous act to reach this feat was Nelly in 2004. This is also the first greatest hits project to reach the top of the chart since 2007 when the Notorious B.I.G. had that distinction.\nMore milestones were reached here. For instance, Purple Rain\u2019s rise to No. 2 helps mark its 100th week on the chart. This week, Prince also has eight albums on the Billboard 200, including 1999, Ultimate, and Sign \u2018O\u2019 the Times."}

Economists and the White House are expecting a huge number, but experts caution it\u2019s likely to be a one-time surge that is not sustainable.\nThe consensus forecast is that the economy grew 4.2 percent in the second quarter, which would be a big jump from the 2 percent growth in the first quarter and nearly double the average annual pace of growth during the recovery. Some economists predict the rate of growth in gross domestic product could come in as high as 5 percent, a figure President Trump would probably herald as proof of his economic success in the face of his critics, although it is a quarterly growth rate, not an annual one.\nEconomists say the spike is coming mainly from a fluke: There was an unusually large increase in exports in the spring that probably came because other countries were trying to buy U.S. goods before Trump\u2019s trade war escalated and tariffs kicked in. Soybeans exports, for example, surged 9,400 percent in the period from March to May over the prior year, Morgan Stanley said. China, a major buyer of U.S. soybeans, put hefty tariffs on the American crop this month in retaliation for Trump\u2019s levies on numerous Chinese products.\nThis is \u201clikely a reflection of stockpiling ahead of the implementation of trade tariffs,\u201d Morgan Stanley economists wrote in a note to clients this week, and they warned that it\u2019s likely that growth will revert to a much lower level in the second half of the year as foreign countries slow their purchases of U.S. goods.\nGrowth this spring is probably \u201cas good as it gets,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the audit firm RSM. Like many economists, he expects that the jump in exports added as much as two percentage points to second-quarter growth and that the increase will disappear in the summer and fall.\nThe GOP tax cuts are also driving some of the uptick, economists say. Consumer spending and business investment are expected to show some pickup, although debate remains over whether it will be a sizable boost. The White House predicts growth will be strong in 2018 and continue on a faster track for the next decade, but many independent forecasters, including the Federal Reserve, predict growth will stay below 3 percent this year and will fall back down to around 2 percent by 2020.\nHere\u2019s what to watch for when the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases second-quarter GDP growth Friday.\n1) It\u2019s likely to be a big number, but not unprecedented. It\u2019s not unusual to get a really large growth number for a single quarter. During the Obama administration, for example, the GDP growth rate topped 4 percent for several quarters and hit 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014.\n\u201cThe underlying momentum in the economy is good, but not 4.5 percent good,\u201d said Ben Herzon, executive director of Macroeconomic Advisers. He expects growth will fall back to around 3 percent the rest of the year.\n2) Is it sustainable? The vast majority of economists predict strong second-quarter growth won\u2019t be sustained. The export surge is likely to be temporary, meaning it will take a big jump in consumer or business spending later in the year to keep growth high, something that will be hard to do."}

In the same way that document programs can shrink a page to 50 or 20 or 2 percent of its original size, a 3-D printing program can shrink a blueprint for 100-foot-long skeletons to a more manageable size for study.\nThe assembled dino-bots will help Lacovara, who is based at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pa., study how 60- to 80-ton sauropods stood, walked and mated. \"It&apos;s great,\" he said, \"because I physically can&apos;t lift up [and piece together] the bones.\"\n\"It&apos;s this new frontier in paleontology,\" he told InnovationNewsDaily.\nLacovara will use lasers to scan original, fossilized bones. Then a 3-D printer will make copies of the bones&apos; shape, based on the scans. The printer works by laying down thin layers of plastic, gradually building up the layers into a 3-D object.\nLacovara has already printed a few bones of a Paralititan dinosaur, one of the most massive dinosaur species ever discovered. He, along with an engineering colleague at Drexel, will hook up the printed skeletons with artificial muscles and tendons, creating robots they can watch move. He hopes to have a working dino limb, either of Paralititan or another large sauropod, by the end of the year.\nHe&apos;s not the only biologist who has started using 3-D printing in his research. Others are using the technology to study the bones and movement of fluorescent deep-sea fish and humankind&apos;s primate ancestors. The Canadian Museum of Nature in Ontario has its own 3-D printing center for dinosaur fossils.\nBesides their re-sizing ability, 3-D printers help researchers create more models more easily than ever. Usually, scientists who want model bones have to painstakingly create molds from original fossils, then use the molds to cast artificial bones. The molds wear out after five or six uses, Lacovara said. On the other hand, a 3-D printer can continue to print crisp, accurate bones indefinitely."}

The missionary group set forth from Ireland to evangelize the continent of Europe. After an illness forced St. Gallen to remain near the Arbon district of northern Switzerland, he decided to dedicate himself to the hermitic life.\n\u201cHis reputation for holiness attracted many to him, giving birth to a monastic community that would become, in turn, the driving force for more missions among many people,\u201d the Pope noted.\nThe Plenary Assembly for the Council of the Episcopal European Conference is taking place from Sept. 27-30 in St. Gallen, which has been the seat of the Council\u2019s secretariat since 1978.\nThis year also marks the 1400th anniversary of St. Gallen\u2019s arrival in the canton of Switzerland that now bears his name.

But he never did, and now he\u2019s ignoring requests even though I told him I would have to write about his candidate\u2019s unwillingness to answer basic substantive issue questions.\nBills says he aligns with Paul predominantly on economic issues. \u201cWe\u2019re all Ron Paul fans on economics,\u201d says Bills\u2019s campaign manager, Mike Osskopp. When it comes to talking about foreign policy, Bills says, Israel is an important ally and America ought not retreat from the world stage, contrasting himself from some of Paul\u2019s well-known foreign policy stances. But, Bills adds, Republicans have to campaign in 2012 on issues regarding federal spending and the economy, not world affairs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we win on in November,\u201d Bills says.

DeHaas landed at Deloitte in 2002 after a long career at Andersen--the year 5,000 Andersen employees found themselves looking for new jobs after the firm's indictment in the Enron scandal.\nQ. As a child, what did you want to do when you grew up?\nA. I wanted to be an accountant. My mom was the only woman accounting major at the University of Pittsburgh when she graduated in 1951. Then she worked in Gulf Oil's accounting department, helping my dad through med school.\nShe became our town's first woman councilman, first woman church elder, but she always said accounting was a great job. It's tough to say whether it was her influence or her genes.\nQ. At what point in your working life did what you're doing now become your goal? Did you get a big break or have mentors?\nA. When I was a senior auditor at Arthur Andersen, I seriously thought about taking a high-level internal audit job at a company and went to Joe Hinkel and Bob Kutsenda, both very senior partners, for guidance. They didn't want me to leave and laid out a plan for how I could achieve great success. They helped me see myself in a partner role, which I hadn't considered before. It was inspiring to me. I stayed.\nQ. Were any classes from college particularly helpful in your career?\nA. I was in one of the last Duke classes that was able to graduate with an undergraduate business major, which required lots of required liberal arts courses, but meant less time for accounting courses. When I started at Andersen I initially felt my accounting background wasn't as strong as my colleagues'. Now, I realize these classes taught me how to think and solve problems creatively.\nQ. What previous job best prepared you for this one?\nA. When I was at Duke, I worked in the campus dining hall accounting office, getting there at 6 a.m. to process meal cards in computers and do basic accounting work. I also worked in the catering department planning special events and waitressing them, which really taught me about the concept of client service.\nQ. Sometimes the best-laid plans get changed due to unforeseen circumstances. Did that happen to you?\nA. I would have stayed at Andersen for my entire career. I'd never thought about the possibility of moving to another firm. Then, we were so gratified at how Chicago business leaders, the mayor, and Chicago Chamber of Commerce helped the people of Andersen identify career and job opportunities and how the Deloitte people welcomed us and went out of their way to help us succeed.\nQ. Have you ever had a career setback?\nA. It wasn't a setback, but a difficult assignment. I was 34 and 8 1/2 months pregnant with my first son when a major client for whom I'd worked in the past asked if I could be reassigned to his work, which involved running around the world. I talked to my husband. We decided that it would be a great opportunity, even though our lives would become chaos. It took a year to rectify the situation. I learned so much about teamwork, delegating, coordinating people around the world. It was an amazing growth experience, but it required taking on some risk.\nQ. What was your childhood like?\nA.

As a result, many fewer cases of the most common cancer to hit men are being diagnosed, research finds.\nTesting for prostate cancer has declined after a recommendation in 2012 said it shouldn't be routine.\nOne of the most intense debates in men's health has flared again: How often should men get screened for prostate cancer?\nThis debate has simmered since 2012, when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force shocked many patients and doctors by recommending against routine prostate cancer screening.\nSome doctors welcomed the change by the influential panel of experts, saying it would save many men from experiencing false alarms and potentially serious complications of unnecessary treatment.\nOthers feared the new recommendation would cause more men to die from prostate cancer because their tumors would not be found until the cancer had progressed.\nBut no one knew what would happen.\nTwo studies released Tuesday don't settle the issue, but they do shed light on the effect of the recommendation against screening: Both studies found a sharp drop in PSA testing, and one found a significant fall in the rate at which men are getting diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\"The take-home message to me is that the American public actually did listen to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,\" says Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, which conducted one of the studies.\nFor years, doctors recommended that middle-age and older men routinely get the PSA test. The test is named after a protein called prostate-specific antigen, which prostate tumors produce. The level of the protein in the blood can indicate the presence of a tumor. It can also be high for other reasons, including a urinary tract infection.\nBut the task force concluded the testing caused unnecessary suffering and that there was insufficient evidence that annual PSA screening significantly reduced the death rate from prostate cancer. That's because many men get biopsies, surgery and radiation for tumors that never become life-threatening, the task force concluded. The treatment often leaves men impotent and incontinent. In rare cases, treatment can cause fatal complications.\nIn the latest research, published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the cancer society analyzed data from government registries and surveys that track cancer diagnoses and screening. The analysis found the percentage of men ages 50 and older who reported PSA screening in the previous year fell by 18 percent \u2014 from 38 percent of those men in 2010 to 31 percent in 2013.\nThe researchers also found the rate at which men were diagnosed with prostate cancer fell from 505 per 100,000 in 2010 to 416 in 2012. That means 33,519 fewer men were being diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, the researchers calculated.\nA second team of researchers at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit conducted a separate analysis that was published in the same issue of JAMA. That analysis found PSA screening dropped 16 percent \u2014 from 36 percent of men to 30 percent \u2014 during the same period.\nThe decline in screening is \"very disturbing,\" says Vanderbilt University urologist David Penson, who wrote an editorial accompanying the papers.

The initiative concerns specifically access to \"SME growth markets\", a recently introduced category of trading venue dedicated to small issuers.\n\"Thanks to the deal reached with the European Parliament, we will make it easier for our small and medium businesses to get the finance they need to grow and create jobs in the EU.

This is partially due to high compliance costs on the one hand and insufficient liquidity on the other. The proposed rules therefore aim at reducing the administrative burden and cut red-tape faced by smaller companies.\nThe proposal contains amendments to the market abuse and the prospectus regulations which make the obligations placed on SME growth market issuers more proportionate while preserving market integrity and investor protection.\nThe new rules adapt and reduce reporting obligations, in particular as regards persons that have access to price-sensitive information(\"insiders' lists\"). They also extended the possibility to use a lighter \"prospectus\" more suited to SMEs that have already been listed on an SME growth market.\nThe Parliament will vote on the agreement during the April plenary.

Should either Twitter or Square be concerned?\nRunning two companies is never an easy thing, but the good news is that there are several examples of executives who were successful at it. Steve Jobs did it, and Elon Musk is doing it as we speak. With Jack Dorsey recently returning to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as permanent CEO, and his other company, payments start-up Square, now filing to go public, Dorsey may soon find himself in charge of two public companies.\nJack Dorsey, our co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Twitter. This may at times adversely affect his ability to devote time, attention, and effort to Square.\nCan Dorsey juggle both companies at once?\nCurrently, Dorsey has an estimated net worth of about $2.3 billion, and naturally, the majority of this wealth is attributable to his stakes in Twitter and Square. But he has relatively less invested in Twitter. Here are his current stakes in both companies, according to recent SEC filings.\nSource: SEC filings. Figures do not include options or unvested shares.\nAt current prices of just below $31, that Twitter stake is worth approximately $672 million. There isn't a lot of available data on Square's share price in private markets, but the company was valued at $6 billion a year ago, and Dorsey holds a 24% stake in the company. That would suggest that his position in Square is valued at more than $1.5 billion.\nDorsey recently purchased nearly 32,000 shares of Twitter in the open market in August as a very public vote of confidence -- he tweeted to tell the world about it -- but the reality is that he sold roughly 380,000 shares in the year before that.\nIt's worth pointing out that Dorsey has given away more than 15 million Square shares during the past two years to help underserved communities, and plans to give away even more. While a larger stake in Square doesn't necessarily mean that Dorsey will be more devoted to the payments start-up, he does stand to lose a lot more if Square performs poorly.\nThere's also a possibility that Dorsey has more pride as a founder in Square, because he is just one of two founders at the payments start-up. On the other hand, Dorsey was one of Twitter's four founders. But Twitter was Dorsey's first big hit. Dorsey started Square after co-founder Jim McKelvey was unable to accept a credit payment for a piece of art, and the pair decided to do something about it.\nThere's no way to measure Dorsey's pride in each respective company that he's founded. But both companies require a lot of work. Twitter is in obvious turnaround mode after continued stagnation in user growth. I have my own doubts about Square's upside potential considering its focus on small and local merchants."}

I still remember my horror at the thought of being encased in metal looking at the world through an angled mirror installed above my head.\nI was an early recipient of the vaccine, and stopped fearing polio while still quite young. But I never fully lost my iron lung queasiness\u201dwhich was why I was nervous one July day in 1996 as I knocked on the door of the Berkeley apartment of an anti-assisted suicide activist I was to interview . The man\u0092s name was Mark O\u0092Brien. Only a month younger than me, he had contracted polio in 1955 and spent the rest of his life living my childhood nightmare. We would soon become fast friends.\nMy first impression on entering was the rhythmic whoosh-whoosh-whoosh of the large yellow machine that dominated the living room. But the lung soon ceased to matter. Mark gave me a dazzling smile and we were soon immersed deeply in conversation. His voice was gravelly, his mind sharp, his wit quick. I was impressed that he was reading Shakespeare. Mark gave a facial shrug. Television irritated his eyes, he said, so he read voraciously using a wand held by his astonishingly prehensile tongue to turn the pages, a tool he also employed to write on a computer strategically placed near his head.\nMark\u0092s true yearning was not for regular access to sexual release but for full inclusion in a society too often indifferent to the common humanity of its disabled members. Indeed, his personal calling was to wage all-out war against society\u0092s tendency to isolate the disabled and, concomitantly, to demand respect , that simple but indispensable mutual acknowledgment that we owe each other as equals.\nHis pursuit of the cause started early in a youthful rebellions against autocratic staff in nursing homes. (His rollicking tales reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0092s Nest .) It continued in the physical ordeal of attending of UC Berkeley while fully quadriplegic. ( Breathing Lessons includes clips taken by news crews of Mark driving himself to school on the city\u0092s sidewalks lying supine on a motorized gurney.) It flowered in his long career as a journalist, disability rights activist, and poet, arguing vehemently on behalf of the independent living movement that had liberated him to live in his own apartment, cared for by a personal attendant that he hired\u201dand could fire.\nBy the time I met Mark, post-polio syndrome had sapped most of his remaining physical vitality. He was terrified of leaving the womb of the machine, but still would defy polio to make occasional personal appearances. For example, he made a triumphant presentation at a Berkeley screening of Breathing Lessons I attended, even taking questions from the audience (at the cost of significant exhaustion).\nOne of the last times I saw Mark, he was arguing with a physician. A power outage and the failure of his redundant electrical system had landed him in the hospital from near suffocation. The doctor wanted to discharge him, but Mark wasn\u0092t ready. When I walked in, the doctor turned away from Mark and started talking to me. Mark read him the riot act, and he soon received the extra time he thought he needed to be able to return safely home.\nThey say life is what you make of it. By this and any measurement, Mark triumphed. His funeral mass was attended by hundreds of mourners, including at least one girlfriend of whom"}

Through the Index, governments can identify their relative strengths and weaknesses. In Africa, for example, internet penetration levels need to rise to promote e-commerce readiness.\nMaking information and communications technology work for development requires more than expanding the infrastructure, the report says. In order to foster productive and inclusive use of information and communications technology, governments need to create legal, institutional and policy frameworks and generate the necessary skills in government, business and civil society and the Index measures progress in those areas.\nAmong developing countries, States at the top end of the Index are in East Asia, including the Republic of Korea and Singapore, with larger countries such as Brazil, China and Russia performing better than predicted, suggesting that large markets facilitate e-commerce.\nBusiness-to-consumer e-commerce, valued at $1.2 trillion, is currently much smaller than business-to-business (B2B), which is worth $15 trillion, but is growing at a faster rate, especially in Asia and Africa, and is expected to double in size to $2.4 trillion by 2018.\nTo enable that, postal networks will be vital and the report measures data on home postal delivery as an indicator of countries\u2019 readiness to engage in B2C e-commerce. In Latin America and the Caribbean and in Asia and Oceania, the extension of postal home delivery was found to be particularly important.\nThe UNCTAD report also notes that growing concerns over cybercrime affect the willingness of both buyers and sellers to make transactions online, with research showing that the enactment of laws to facilitate security and trust in online transactions varies considerably globally, with significant gaps in many developing countries.\nAlthough the United States is by far the most targeted country, accounting for almost half of known cases of cybercrime, information security is a rising concern for governments, enterprises and consumers around the world, especially given that $3.5 billion was lost in supplier revenue due to online fraud in 2012.\nUNCTAD\u2019s report calls for interoperability of legal measures between States, with 117 countries having enacted cybercrime legislation. Ensuring international compatibility of e-transaction laws remains a challenge and the report says the legal recognition of e-signatures, electronic contracts and evidence at a national level should ideally be extended to those originating in other jurisdictions."}

And two officers were to be posted at a safety booth at Newcomb's Ranch, a popular caf\u00e9 on the highway, to provide information to motorists and answer questions.\n\"We are experiencing a slight increase in the number of traffic collisions on the Angeles Forest roadways,\" said Capt. Bill Dance, commander of the Altadena area. \"Too often, we respond to collisions involving motorists who have lost control of their vehicles due to unsafe speed, or who collide into an oncoming vehicle as they drift over the double-yellow lines.\"\nHowever, on Sept. 22 CHP officials received an executive order from the governor's office informing them that the grant had been suspended due to the state's ongoing budget crisis.\nLong stretches of the highway have been closed for repairs since the winter rains and resulting slides, and are not expected to reopen until November. Nonetheless, there have been 17 motorcycle accidents on roadways in Angeles National Forest this year, Hsu said. In August alone, there were five accidents, up from a monthly average of about two, Hsu said.\nThe most recent Angeles Crest Highway accident occurred Tuesday at about 2:40 p.m., according to officials. A motorcyclist was transported via helicopter to a hospital after falling 40 feet about six miles north of Newcomb's Ranch.\nHsu attributed the increase in accidents to motorists who are accessing the upper portion of Angeles Crest Highway via Big Tujunga Canyon Road.\n\"At the beginning of the year, people were thinking the entire Crest was closed,\" Hsu said. \"It is just [La Ca\u00f1ada] to Angeles Forest Highway, so more and more riders are finding they can go around the back and still access the top part of the Crest.\"\nCHP officers will continue to promote motorcycle safety through public-awareness campaigns and patrolling, but patrol units will have to be spread out between local freeways and the mountain roads, Hsu said.\n\"We will still be putting officers up there, just not in the huge numbers we were hoping to get. We want to remind all the drivers to watch out for one another,\" Hsu said. \"Be extra careful because of the increased ridership, not just during weekends but during the weekdays as well.\""}

{"idx": "18824", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Jo Rodgers and Ted Purdy had long thought about installing a solar system on their carport roof, but the price just wasn\ufffdt right until last year. After a site assessment from a local installer, they were disappointed to learn that even with the recent fall in prices for solar power equipment, their roof catches too much afternoon shade for the installation to make sense.\nJo and Ted are not alone: Hundreds of interested residents and businesses in Eugene can\ufffdt install solar because they rent their property, live in the shade, need roof repairs, or lack the upfront financing for an entire system. More still are dissuaded from installing because they lack the tax liability needed to capture the federal and state incentives.\nGiven these circumstances, a new approach is needed to maximize the potential for distributed solar power, which is desperately needed to combat climate change and rising electricity prices.\nOne piece of the solution is community-shared solar.\nWhat is community-shared solar? These are off-site solar electric systems owned by individuals and businesses that purchase participation in exchange for financial benefits or credited electricity. Because such projects make solar power accessible to customers who are otherwise unable to invest in solar, they present the possibility for dramatic increases in solar electric generation.\nAlong with more generation comes the creation and retention of jobs in the solar industry.\nCommunity-shared solar also has the potential to reduce the inequity of the current solar incentive structure and reach under-served populations. Taxpayers and ratepayers typically fund incentives for solar installations, but these incentives are generally available only to those who are able to install on their own property and who have a tax liability. Community-shared solar increases social equity by making financial incentives accessible to a broader swath of the community, including those who cannot typically participate.\nThe Resource Innovation Group is spearheading an effort involving numerous stakeholders to develop the Common Good Solar project: a first-of-its-kind central, shared local solar system that would be available to Eugene Water & Electric Board customers regardless of whether they own or rent, live in the shade or sun, can pay for an entire solar array, or can capture available incentives.\nParticipation in Common Good Solar would cost a few hundred to several thousand dollars, allowing households to pay just what they desire and can afford or to pay enough to maximize the amount of their own electricity use they are offsetting with solar. Thanks to EWEB\ufffds willingness to provide the roof space, the 40- to 100-kilowatt solar electric system would be housed on solar-ready awnings at EWEB\ufffds Roosevelt Operations Facility. The goal is for participants to get their full initial contribution back in dollars or in kilowatt-hour credits over the life of the project.\nThe construction of Common Good Solar would showcase Eugene as a forward-thinking national leader in renewable energy. It would also provide a much-needed model for the development of community-shared solar projects that can be replicated in Eugene and throughout Oregon and even the nation. In doing so it would increase locally generated, renewable energy here in Eugene.\nTRIG has honed in on strategies for overcoming common obstacles and has participation in project development from the Oregon Department of Energy and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, among others that see this project as bound for success.\nAdditional funding will be needed to make this vision a reality. One possibility is a grant from EWEB\ufffds Greenpower program. EWEB customers who are registered participants in the program will be voting for their favorites among proposals competing for a $100,000 Greenpower grant.

Now, the song recognition is done through an app.\n\"The way Shazam started off its business model was that after five [SMS] 'tags' you had to pay for it,\" said Marovac. \"Then it moved into lead-generation for MP3s, then it became an affiliate for streaming companies.\"\nIn other words, if you identified a song, then clicked a link inside Shazam to buy the song through iTunes, a cut of your payment would go to Shazam. But that became less profitable when streaming took off.\nApple once dominated music consumption, when people bought individual MP3 tracks through iTunes. Since the advent of Spotify, it hasn't kept up. Shazam might be a way to drive growth once again.\n\"Since Apple has launched Apple Music, it's still a way behind the curve, behind Spotify,\" said Marovac. \"Shazam has 150 million active users a month, and about 300 million to 400 million uniques per year. If you convert 1% to 5% of those users to Apple Music, the investment will pay for itself in spades.\"\nApple Music had 30 million paying subscribers, according to statistics released in September. Adding 5% of Shazam's base would add a maximum of 7.5 million paying users \u2014 a nice bump, but also best case scenario.\nFor long-time music industry watcher and Midia analyst Mark Mulligan, the deal is more than just generating paying users for Apple Music.\nCustomer acquisition is one reason why Apple might have acquired Shazam, Mulligan told Business Insider. It's also likely Shazam will give Apple Music much needed new features that will keep users sticking around for longer, like Spotify's massively successful playlists.\n\"Ultimately Apple will have relatively small concerns about how it will be able to acquire customers for Apple Music in the longer term,\" Mulligan said.\n\"In relative terms, it's behind Spotify in terms of playlists and weekly active use,\" he added. \"Those are the metrics it needs to do more to drive. The Shazam dataset will be an important asset.\"\nWhen you open the Shazam app and identify a song, you can then stream that song via Apple Music or rivals like Amazon Music and Spotify. That's valuable insight into how people are using other services.\n\"It's a window into billions of data points about Sh"}

NYC\u2019s top cop had been cautious, if cryptic, in his responses to the Brooklyn DA\u2019s unilateral decision, which does not affect the city\u2019s other four boroughs.\nBut on Tuesday, Thompson\u2019s office made it official: \u201cThis new policy is a reasonable response to the thousands of low-level marijuana arrests that weigh down the criminal justice system, require significant resources that could be redirected to more serious crimes, and take an unnecessary toll on offenders,\u201d the district attorney said in a statement.\nThe tension in New York underscores a growing national ambivalence about the recreational use of marijuana. This week, Washington became the second state to issue licenses to grow and sell what users call \u201cweed\u201d for personal, recreational use, regulating the drug more like cigarettes and alcohol. Colorado did the same in January, and 23 other states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for certain medical uses.\nOn Wednesday, the Obama administration unveiled its new national drug control strategy, which promotes alternatives to incarceration for many drug crimes. And while the administration says it has not stopped enforcing the federal ban on marijuana, last year Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo clarifying eight areas of priority when prosecuting federal pot crimes and saying the Justice Department would mostly not interfere with state laws that decriminalized the drug.\nBut as in New York, federal law enforcement officials and local US attorneys have bristled at the policy, and many federal arrests have continued in pot-friendly states, including Washington.\nThis prompted the conservative-dominated House to approve a measure to defund any of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to interfere with state marijuana laws and enforce the federal ban \u2013 a vote that shocked many observers. In June, US Senators Cory Booker (D) of New Jersey and Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky, proposed a similar law in the Senate.\nBut this week the two senators, one a conservative libertarian and the other a progressive liberal, also introduced a bipartisan push in Congress to begin to ease back on the nation\u2019s aggressive criminal stance on such low-level drug crimes \u2013 changes many conservatives still oppose.\nThompson\u2019s unilateral decision in New York, however, is a significant change in the most aggressive pot-busting city in the world.

{"idx": "18837", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: First, the boom in mobile video, which demands far more capacity than previous mobile applications, is changing the nature of wireless data traffic. The millennial and post-millennial generations are consuming far more entertainment on mobile devices than their TV- and PC-bound elders. They videochat on FaceTime and Skype and send video clips on Snapchat and Instagram. Facebook\u2019s new auto-roll video clips now begin playing without a click from the user, turning your newsfeed into a cascading video feed. And apps like Periscope allow celebrities, reporters (and anyone else) to stream real-time video from their phones to their followers.\nMeanwhile, the emerging Internet of Things \u2014 what I call the immersive Internet \u2014 is driving the next big acceleration in the volume of connected devices. The idea that most people on earth now have mobile phones is staggering. These billions of mobile computers far outnumber the connected devices of the earlier Internet era, PCs. As the world becomes saturated with 7 billion or so mobile phones, however, the immersive Internet will multiply that total several times over. In the next decade, we might connect 50 billion or so devices to the Internet \u2014 every car, watch, boat, shoe, package, shipping container, medical device, vending machine, camera, drone, you name it.\nBut this is a very liberal and optimistic interpretation. Almost half of that 389 MHz is contained in a pilot program of spectrum that is to be shared between the government (specifically, the Navy) and the commercial world. The shared spectrum program is an important and useful idea, but it\u2019s only a baby step, and it will take years to launch and refine. Another huge chunk \u2014 some 100 MHz \u2014 is \u201cpending\u201d a successful incentive auction of underused broadcast TV spectrum. But this auction, perhaps the most complex in history, has already been delayed several times. It is mired in complicated rules, litigation and now renewed efforts to reopen the already controversial rules. And of the new licensed spectrum actually cleared for commercial use in the last eight years, a single company, Dish Network, which has no mobile customers, acquired over half of it. In truth, we are thus far short of the 500 MHz goal.\nFor the last several years, T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. mobile firms, have argued for special set-asides of spectrum to help boost business. They\u2019ve argued they are spectrum-poor compared to AT&T and Verizon, although on a per-subscriber basis they actually own more.\nIn particular, T-Mobile and Sprint have argued that their relative lack of \u201clow-band\u201d spectrum in the 600-800 MHz range makes it difficult for them to compete. Sprint and T-Mobile, which own most of their spectrum in the mid- and high-bands, said low-band spectrum is more useful because of its greater coverage of broader geographic areas. They successfully lobbied the FCC to tilt the incentive auction rules in their favor, making it more likely they will obtain low-band spectrum at discounted prices than in a free and open auction.\nThe record-setting sums bid in the AWS-3 auction early this year demonstrate conclusively the value of mid-band spectrum. In fact, Goldman Sachs says the $41 billion AWS-3 auction was a game changer. It \u201creset our understanding of where value is stored within the sector,\u201d Goldman writes. \u201cThe valuations bid for these \u2018mid-band\u2019 frequencies were not only more than 2x what we had expected, they fl"}

Mike Holmes, the commander of Air Combat Command, recently expressed his intent to emphasize a \u201cready now\u201d mentality among Airmen across the command.\nTo meet this intent, Holmes is encouraging Airmen to understand how physical fitness directly relates to agile squadrons and combat readiness.\nThe standard outlined in Air Force Instruction 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, applies to all Airmen. All service members are required to be physically ready to accomplish the mission and actively participate in the Air Force fitness program and always meet Air Force fitness standards by maintaining a year-round physical conditioning program that emphasizes total fitness, to include: aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training and healthy eating.\nTony Arroyo, 633rd Force Support Squadron Fitness Center director, and Monica Richardson, 633rd Aerospace Medicine Squadron health promotion coordinator, provided ACC senior leaders with four tips to ensure Airmen are able to pass their fitness assessments at any given moment.\nSimply put, move, nourish, refresh, and connect.\n1. Move and train smart. There\u2019s no magic pill.\nIf Airmen engage in rigorous physical activity five to six days a week, they will be far better off than being sedentary until the months, weeks, or days before their fitness assessments.\nArroyo advises that Airmen always be prepared to avoid last-minute prep, which is sometimes caused from being overweight.\nIn addition to last minute prep, Airmen who aren\u2019t able to manage their weight well can inadvertently add pressure on their joints and cause injuries such as shin splints and runner\u2019s knee.\nAirmen are encouraged to be specific with their training regimen when they are training for their timed 1.5 mile run.\nThroughout the rest of the year, Airmen can do aerobic exercises they enjoy if they don\u2019t prefer to run, Arroyo said.\nThe diversity also takes away some of the monotony of physical fitness and helps Airmen continue to see results, Arroyo said.\nArroyo also advised that Airmen practice using proper form when strength training for the muscular components of the fitness assessment.\nIf Airmen nourish their bodies with whole, unprocessed foods instead of fast-food, sodas, energy drinks, sugary juices and junk food, they will have more strength, energy and endurance to perform well in their fitness assessments.\nRichardson advises against Airmen participating in activities that can cause dehydration right before a PT test or during their physical training.\nRichardson recommends Airmen to avoid diets that cause extreme calorie restrictions.\nRichardson said Airmen should put the proper nutrition in their bodies (in addition to hydrating) on the days, weeks, and months before their fitness test.\nIf Airmen allow their minds and bodies to take a break, they will not only perform better, but also feel better.\nArroyo recommends that even the fittest Airmen add active recovery cycles and at least one full day of rest into each week of their personal fitness plans.\nAs Comprehensive Airman Fitness is a key component of Holmes\u2019 plan, the general emphasizes that Airmen take time to connect with their families and friends.\nDemonstrating and supporting a healthy work-life balance helps build and support healthy families, Holmes said.\nStay tuned to https://www.acc.af.mil for more information on this year\u2019s focus on fitness."}

{"idx": "18852", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Employers in many industries are free to adopt a work schedule for their employees that best suits the company's business. Different work schedules can be established for different employees, such as a day shift, evening shift and night shift. Depending on the company's business needs, employers may require employees to change shifts or work back-to-back shifts, such as night shift to day shift. Federal and state labor laws permit employers to do this as long as the companies comply with minimum wage and overtime pay laws, as well as any applicable safety laws.\nThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA) defines a workweek as seven consecutive 24-hour periods or 168 consecutive hours. An employer can choose the day of the week and time of day when a workweek begins. The workweek established by the employer is used as the basis for determining compliance with minimum wage and overtime pay rules.\nAlthough not required by law, employers usually pay a shift differential for employees working shifts other than the day shift, such as the night shift or \"graveyard shift.\" Employers can change an employee's shift if the change is intended to be permanent and not designed to avoid FSLA overtime pay rules.\nAccording to the Department of Labor, employers would incorrectly pay for overtime by failing to include shift differential pay in overtime pay calculations. For example, an employee making $8 per hour for day shift work may receive an additional $1 per hour as shift differential pay for working a night shift. The FSLA requires overtime pay to be one and one half times an employee's regular rate of pay during the workweek when overtime was worked.\n\"Regular rate of pay\" is defined by the FSLA as an employee's base rate of pay plus all additional pay, including shift differential pay and other bonus pay. Employers miscalculate the overtime pay by only using the base rate of pay to calculate the overtime pay.\nIn some situations, employers may require employees to work different shifts in the same day, such as going from working the night shift to working the next day shift. This commonly occurs for companies that provide emergency response services or disaster relief. Although working extended or unusual shifts can be difficult for employees, federal labor laws generally do not require employers to provide employees with time off between shifts. Only few safety-sensitive industries are required by law to provide time off after a work shift is completed.\nFor example, federal law requires truck drivers to rest for 34 consecutive hours after reaching their maximum driving hours in a workweek, and airline pilots must rest at least 10 hours between flight duty shifts.\nSplit-shift rules may require extra pay for affected employees. A split shift includes a period of time during the work day that the employee does not work. The employee is not paid for this time, nor is it considered rest or meal time. However, the employee is entitled to receive a split-shift premium, which is equal to one hour pay at the minimum wage rate, which in California, for example, is $8 per hour, as of publication.\nIf the employee is paid an hourly rate greater than minimum wage, a portion of the split premium may be offset depending on the employee's hourly wage and number of hours worked.\nStone, Joe. \"Night Shift to Day Shift Labor Laws.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/night-shift-day-shift-labor-laws-76454.html. 05 March 2019.\nChild Labor Laws: How Many Hours Can a 17-Year-Old Work?"}

That's according to research by the World Resources Institute's Better Buying Lab in conjunction with food chains, marketers and behavioral economists.\nBy now, you've likely heard the argument to eat less meat for the health of the planet. Heck, even Beyonc\u00e9 has been pushing this message, dangling the prospect of free concert tickets for life before fans to raise interest in plant-based eating for the environment.\nBut if you're an omnivore starving while staring at a menu, it can be hard for the future of planet Earth to compete with the appeal of a big, juicy burger.\n\"The language for meat, and beef in particular, just sounds so much more delicious,\" says Daniel Vennard.

As head of the World Resources Institute's Better Buying Lab, it's his job to work with food companies, behavioral economists and marketing experts to find ways to get people to eat more sustainably. Or, as he puts it, to make \"this party sound even better than the other party.\"\nThe solution, summarized in a new report from the Better Buying Lab, is this: Focus less on the meat-free or health aspects of plant-based foods \u2014 which tend to make consumers feel like they're missing out \u2014 and more on their flavor, mouthfeel and provenance, so it's \"appealing to the inner food critic within all of us,\" Vennard says.\nNow, the goal isn't to get everyone to go vegetarian or vegan \u2014 just to choose plant-based options more often. That's because red meat production requires a huge amount of water, land and other resources, and it's responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut the challenge is, how do you get people to make that swap more often?\nTo find out, the Better Buying Lab teamed up with food companies in the U.K. and U.S., including fast-casual chain Panera Bread. The company had a \"vegetarian black bean soup\" on the menu that was originally labeled as low fat. Customers who tried the soup seemed to like it, but the name didn't seem to encourage a lot of new customers to try it, says Sara Burnett, Panera's vice president for wellness and food policy.\n\" 'Vegetarian' \u2014 the word in and of itself \u2014 to a lot of folks doesn't sound highly craveable,\" Burnett says.\nSo Panera tried out a couple of options to see if it could make that soup sound more scrumptious. When it rebranded the dish as \"Cuban black bean soup\" in a test at 18 stores in Los Angeles and California's Central Valley, sales went up 13 percent.\n\" 'Cuban', in a lot of folks' minds, when they react to that, they think of a flavor profile,\" says Burnett. \"They think of a little bit of heat, a little bit of spice, and that makes people hungry.\"\nA test that Better Buying Lab conducted with Sainsbury's, a major supermarket chain in"}
{"idx": "18855", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Vladimer Papava writes: Under the circumstances of the modern global financial crisis, the problem of economy zombieing has become a very topical one. If in the 1990s the theme of zombieing was basically discussed within the context of the Japanese economy alone, this problem has also extended to the US and European economies today ( Jim Willie CB, 2008. U.S. Economy Disintegrating as Government Supports Zombie Banks. The Market Oracle , December 04 ; Jim Willie CB, 2009. Gold, Zombie Banking System, Lightning, Earthquakes and Hurricanes. The Market Oracle , January 20).\nThe question of economy zombieng is directly associated with the financial crisis. Specifically, companies become increasingly exposed to the threat of insolvency, as a result of financial difficulties, which eventually leads to the growth of unemployment. Obviously, such a situation makes governments feel politically uncomfortable and so they tend to provide financial assistance to such companies so that they could survive and avoid lay-offs. The Japanese experience suggests that governments must come up with some banking sector bailout plans in such a situation in order to enable banks to continue extending loans to insolvent companies. Further obviously, the continuation of lending programmes without such bailouts would lead to the bankruptcy of banks themselves.\nThis is exactly how dead companies and banks come back to life. In other words, it is the creation of zombie companies and zombie banks which, in their turn, make up a whole system of a zombie economy.\nAs far as the Japanese economy is concerned, the paradox herein is that zombie companies and banks tend to continue to exist even after the financial crisis ends. In other words, they continue living even though their existence is no longer necessary. This paradox is explained by the Nelson and Winter economic changes evolution theory ( Nelson Richard R., and Sidney G. Winter, 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cam\u00adbridge , The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press ).\nThe key \u201ctool\u201d of this theory is a concept of \u201croutines\u201d which implies a complex of all those rules and methods of company behaviour which regulate the reproduction of the company's activities.\nWhen a crisis continues to exist for a more-or-less long period of time, insolvent companies tend to adopt such rules and methods of behaviour which are basically aimed at obtaining some government bailout plans rather than providing for the growth of a company's competitive potential. As a result, such companies continue functioning in the same way as they did under the financial crisis.\nThe similar situations are observed in those banks which continue extending loans to zombie companies. The feeling that a government's support is in any case guaranteed promotes the forming of the same routine in such banks as well.\nDue to zombie banks, a zombie company support routine develops in a government as well which comes at the expense of taxpayers who continue extending financial support to dead companies and banks.\nIt is this zombie routine which becomes the modus vivendi of a zombie economy; that is, an entire system of zombie companies, zombie banks and a zombie government.\nThe question which arises herein is this: who is the carrier of the zombie economy routine?\nIf we bear in mind that a zombie economy is a dead economy which can only survive by sucking the blood from taxpayers, it bares logical conclusion that the carrier of a zombie economy is a dead\u2014not alive\u2014being which maintains its existence artificially which is, in fact, precisely what a zombie is.\nWe can call this revived \u201cdead man\u201d of"}

When scientists used x-rays to study the child\u2019s teeth, they discovered that the very first molar, which normally comes in at around six years of age, had pushed through the child\u2019s gums right before their early death.\nThe root of this molar was also found to be nearly complete at the time, which demonstrated that the development of the molar of this child would have been strikingly similar to that of modern children living today. However, other tooth roots that were discovered in the child\u2019s fossilized jaw had grown much quicker than they would in children today.\nBut despite this, paleoanthropologist Song Xing \u2014 of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing \u2014 has stated that, despite living between 104,000 and 200,000 years ago, this East Asian child\u2019s dental growth would have been much the same as it is in children of the current era.\nBecause of the rate of growth in this earlier specimen, scientists believe that the youngster may have been part of the East Asian Homo group \u2014 and would have normally had a fairly long life span. However, identifying the biological group that this child definitively belonged to may prove difficult, as the child in question has such a mix of features that it would be fairly impossible to determine its exact origin.\nFor instance, the large teeth and braincase of the child are remarkably similar to what scientists would expect to find in both Homo erectus and Neanderthal features, but some of the teeth look more like they belong to Homo sapiens. But besides these three species, there is also the possibility that the child may have belonged to the Denisovan group, according to Xing and her colleagues.\nBut whatever species this child belonged to, paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Debbie Guatelli-Steinberg \u2014 of Ohio State University in Columbus \u2014 stated that this is the first time that scientists have been able to study such ancient fossilized teeth from within the Homo population of East Asia.\nThe new study concerning these findings has been published in Science Advances."}

With massive amounts of data and traffic flowing in and out of enterprise networks it is no longer possible to prevent cyber attacks using signature-based security tools.\nCurrent approaches to security can't keep up the velocity and variety of today's threats because they are based largely on the manual work of researchers that investigate attacks through reverse engineering, homegrown tools and general hacking.\nTo protect businesses and their employees from the fire hose volume of nuisance threats like viruses and more damaging advanced attacks like data-stealing Trojans, the industry needs to harness big data techniques to identify, block and remediate threats. So how can we do this?\nFirst, we need to capture a massive amount of data from the internet, which is the source of cyber attacks. To yield the most reliable results, researchers must cast a wide net that is distributed across geographies, sectors, segments, and protocols. Data diversity plays a critical role in our ability to accurately identify attacks.\nNext, we must build infrastructures that can collect, store, process and query the massive volumes of data that are contained in Internet traffic streams flowing in and out of company networks. This enables security researchers to search, visualize and extract actionable information on new cyberattacks before they occur. This must be done in a short enough time span to make any intelligence gathered useful and enforceable.\nWe also need to reconsider the role of the security analyst in a world dominated by Big Data. Instead of manual research into new cyber threats, Big Data security models need to be automated.

The MicroSeveris designed for smaller and SOHO businesses that may be ready to move from a peer\u2013to-peer network (in which all clients act as equals and share resources) to a more-traditional client/server network.\nAs with the HP MicroServer I previously tested, HP's Gen8 server is best suited to small businesses that want centralized file sharing, print services, and remote access. It's not ideal for hosting heavy-transaction databases or other critical enterprise-level applications. If you like your servers with some bling, HP offers colorful front bezels to fit on the chassis\u2014available in Jack Black, Ruby Red, and HP Blue. Additionally, the MicroServer is part of a modular, complete small-business networking solution, designed for stacking with HP's PS1810-8G Switch.\nThe MicroServer has an ultra-micro tower form factor. It's small enough to operate underneath or on top of a desk. It's fairly quiet: The faint, steady hum is about on par with the previous MicroServer I tested.\nCustomers can configure their Gen8 MicroServers with Intel's Dual Core Ivy Bridge i3 Core, Pentium, or Celeron processors. The unit I tested was running Microsoft Small Business Server 2011 and Intel's 2.8GHz Core i3-3220T processor, with 8GB memory (you can buy it with up to 16GB).\nThe standard storage configuration includes four drive bays supporting 6Gbps SATA HDDs in the first two bays and 3Gbps SATA HDDs in the third and fourth bays. Drives are not hot-swappable. Maximum storage capacity is 12TB\u2014that is, four 3TB 3.5-inch SATA drives. Your RAID level options for this server are 0, 1, and 1+ 0 (also called RAID level 10). This is a spec set more for the smaller end of the SMB. Servers for larger businesses typically tend to support additional RAID configurations.\nI was disappointed to see that the Gen8's drive door does not lock, whereas the previous MicroServer's did. The Gen8 does have a Kensington slot for physically securing the server, but, without the door lock, you lose an extra layer of drive security.\nBehind the door in question is a special service tool for the star-shaped screws that hold in place a plate covering system components. Once you're inside, you'll see that this small-form-factor unit isn't built for a lot of tinkering inside. Still, getting into the guts of the server is easier than with the original MicroServer, thanks to easier-to-use internal access mechanisms, including a lever for removing the system board.\nDespite its size, the Gen8 also has plenty of expansion and interface options. These include a rear standard video input, five USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, and a microSD slot. There's also a DVD-RW optical drive on the front.\nA criticism that I had with the Dell PowerEdge T310, another server targeted at the small end of the SMB, was that its management software options are scattered all over the place\u2014in"}

When the vote was taken, the chairman declared that the vote had passed and the meeting was terminated. Several owners asked for a secret ballot and requested an exact count, but the chairman refused to permit the secret ballot or take an exact count. Many owners are now challenging the details of the meeting and want to know if we can have this vote again. We barely made a quorum, with 61 units present, and have been advised that we can petition for a meeting to vote on this again. Could you please explain the procedures?\nDear Dave: If a strata corporation passes a three-quarter-vote resolution where less than 50 per cent of the owners vote in favour of the resolution, people who hold at least 25 per cent of the votes may, by written demand, require the strata to hold another general meeting within four weeks and re-vote on the resolution.\nIn your strata, there are 167 units and, even without an exact count of the votes, with only 61 units present, it is obvious that less than 50 per cent of the owners voted in favour of the resolution, opening the door for a reconsideration.\nTwenty-five per cent, or 42 of your owners, could sign to demand another meeting to vote again. Under a reconsideration of a three-quarter vote, the demand must be made within one week of the first meeting, so it is important to have an exact count reported at the meeting or at least a report of the quorum present to calculate the requirements. This is not a vote to defeat the previous vote, it is a new vote and if it does not get three-quarters in favour it is defeated.\nIf the one-week period has passed, another option is to petition, by 20 per cent of the strata votes, for a special general meeting and have a three-quarter-vote resolution to defeat the previous resolution.\nThis is not a reconsideration of the vote. However, the strata corporation may, by three-quarter vote, consider cancelling the previous resolution.\nWhether an exact count or secret ballot is required, if requested by an owner, is determined in the bylaws of each strata. The Standard Bylaws require a secret ballot if only one eligible voter requests a secret ballot. If an exact count is requested, the count must be announced by the chair and recorded in the minutes of the meeting.\nUnfortunately, there are many strata corporations that have removed these provisions when they adopted new bylaw amendments, which may have left the control of the meeting entirely in the hands of the chairperson. To verify what bylaws apply, print the filed bylaws in the Land Title Registry and compare which are in effect, which have been repealed and whether any of the Standard Bylaws have been repealed or amended.\nDave\u2019s strata has retained the Standard Bylaw 27, which requires a secret ballot and exact count if requested.

Yes, that is me. That is my style of writing. I need to whet your appetite first. I have to incite your curiosity, let you wonder a bit in eagerness to know what I have in store for you.\n? There are three instances of certain family members questioning, \"why are her sons and daughters not dying but only mine?\" In all the three situations among numerous others occurring in Ghana on daily basis, a mother, with or without her children, do query with evil intentions why only the fruits of her womb but not her sister\u2019s, have come under the axe of death? ?\nIn the first case, the younger mother had her granddaughter and two elderly daughters of say, thirty and fifty years old pass (pass away). She queried why only her children are dying but not those of her elder sister\u2019s? A few years later, her elder sister herself died.\n? In the second instance, the elder sister\u2019s children were dying before reaching thirty-nine years or when they were thirty-nine. The only one or two able to survive that age are still alive and are into their mid-seventies. When two of her children died, one thirty-nine and the other around thirty, a famous son of the younger mother wondered how. He asked for a thorough autopsy to be conducted on the bodies. Note, they died in different years. The results were conclusive, proving that they had inherited certain genetic disorder from their dad. This gene does not allow people to live into their forties. ?\nAll along the mother in question and her children did entertain the belief that her younger sister was a witch, killing her (elder sister\u2019s) children while protecting hers as a hen gathers her brood under her wings.

We need to deal with the business we have before us,\u201d Bill Clinton told CNN in December.\nOf course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it\u2019s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.\nYet according to a National Journal analysis of media coverage, the Clintons are not wrong. The 2016 presidential race has received more attention earlier than any other in recent memory, quickening a tendency that began some 30 years ago.\nThe Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut keeps a comprehensive database of public opinion polls, so we asked its researchers to compare similar periods for the last four presidential elections in which there was no incumbent (open elections attract more polls and more attention).\nThey had nine polls in their records for the 2016 presidential election conducted from January through March of this year. During the same period in 2006, two years before the 2008 presidential election, they found seven polls. For 1998, it was six polls. And for 1990, just two.\nBut the media coverage is even more telling. Whether we looked at just the four biggest national newspapers, all U.S. publications in the Nexis database, or mentions on broadcast news outlets, we found a clear trend toward more coverage in more-recent presidential cycles, with 2016 in many cases doubling the early coverage of 2008.\nSo far this year, all American publications in Nexis\u2019s database have written 520 stories that mention the 2016 presidential \u201celection\u201d or \u201crace\u201d\u2014nearly triple the number from January through March of 2006, when there were just 176 stories.\nTo make sure this wasn\u2019t a fluke, we looked at month-by-month data going back all the way to the month before the preceding presidential election. The early coverage of 2016 easily outstripped the early coverage of 2008 in all but three months, and overall about doubled the number of stories written from October 2004 through March 2006.\n\u201cThe 2016 election has received more media coverage this year than either the 2012 or 2008 campaigns received during comparable time frames,\u201d the Pew Research Center\u2019s Paul Hitlin noted last year, after conducting similar analysis focused on regional newspapers.\nThis is, of course, intuitive to anyone paying attention to political news. The New York Times dedicated a reporter to covering Hillary Clinton full time in July of last year, and at least a half-dozen other publications (including National Journal) have, too.\nIf you turned on the TV or radio in recent months, you were far more likely to find a story about the upcoming presidential election than during a comparable point in the past few election cycles. Just look at the number of times people discussed the next presidential election on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, or the PBS NewsHour from January through March more than two years before the election: In 2016, there were 69 mentions, in 2008 just 31, and in 2000 only four.\nTo try to get"}

Khosla's lawyer, Jeff Essner, claims the beach road has always been private and that his client has every right to keep trespassers off his property. He claims there was a gate on the road long before the passage of the Coastal Act, which negates the need for a permit.\nDuring his testimony on Monday, Khosla said his sole intent with regard to his legal activities was \"to find out what the law says with regard to what is public access and what is not.\"\nHe said he never read legal documents or official letters relating to the property and that everything he did was on the advice of counsel. All decisions about the property were made by Baugher, he said.\nBaugher largely confirmed that story Tuesday. He denied that Khosla had any intention of building anything in particular on the property, but admitted he inquired about whether building a residence would be permitted. He admitted during questioning that he was told that building a residence would require public access and a coastal development permit.\nHe said he actually applied for a permit to move onto the property some cypress trees mistakenly planted on Caltrans land, but withdrew it and discarded the trees when he was told the permit would cost $16,000.\nMartins Beach was owned for more than 100 years by the Deeney family, which set up the first cabin in 1918 and continued building through the 1950s.

The ban was meant to address the growing problem of less trustworthy reviews that had been plaguing the retailer\u2019s site, leading to products with higher ratings than they would otherwise deserve.\nIncentivized reviews are those where the vendor offers free or discounted products to reviewers, in exchange for recipients writing their \u201chonest opinion\u201d of the item in an Amazon review. However, data has shown that these reviewers tend to write more positive reviews overall, with products earning an average of 4.74 stars out of five, compared with an average rating of 4.36 for non-incentivized reviews.\nOver time, these reviews proliferated on Amazon, and damaged consumers\u2019 trust in the review system as a whole. And that can impact consumers\u2019 purchase decisions.\nAccording to recent findings from ReviewMeta, a business that analyzes millions of reviews to help consumers find those they can trust, Amazon has been rapidly deleting incentivized reviews \u2013 even retroactively.\nThis is especially interesting because Amazon had said at the time of the ban\u2019s announcement that it would only remove incentivized reviews from older products if they were \u201cexcessive\u201d or if they didn\u2019t comply with the prior policy.\nBut apparently, Amazon is going back to remove a large number of older reviews, as well.\nReviewMeta checked up on Amazon\u2019s progress by analyzing its own dataset of around 65 million reviews across 32,060 products in all categories.\nIt found that Amazon had deleted over 500,000 reviews, 71 percent of which were incentivized. The average rating for these deleted reviews was 4.75 stars \u2013 clearly much higher than the typical average. Some products even saw thousands of reviews removed \u2013 like this cosmetic scrub, which had 9,000 reviews removed, for example.\nThe company then analyzed a subset of products from over the past two weeks to get a sense of how many incentivized reviews still remain on Amazon\u2019s site.\nAcross the over 10 million reviews analyzed (a dataset based on those consumers entered on the ReviewMeta website), only 1.5 percent of the reviews were incentivized.\n\u201cThis is considerably less than we were seeing previously,\u201d says Tommy Noonan, ReviewMeta CTO. \u201cFor every incentivized review we found on Amazon, there were 2.6 in our database that weren\u2019t there anymore,\u201d he adds, referring to the deleted reviews.\nWhat the figures seem to indicate is that, though Amazon is deleting a large number incentivized reviews, it hasn\u2019t managed to catch all of them. Part of the problem could be that incentivized reviews are still rolling in, despite Amazon\u2019s ban.\nThat said, the number of incentivized reviews has dropped significantly following the ban, and this, in turn, has lowered the average rating for all reviews. The day before the ban was enacted, for instance, the average rating for all reviews that day was 4.73; on November 1, the average rating for all reviews had dropped to 4.65.\nWhat\u2019s also interesting, Noonan notes, is that Amazon\u2019s product ratings were largely unaffected, despite the mass deletions. The product ratings \u2013 that is, when Amazon tells you that a product is \u201c4.5 out of 5 stars\u201d \u2013 appear to have already been adjusted to discount the incentivized reviews when calculating the overall rating.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that many incent"}

It provides caffeine, which helps to stimulate the body and mind and be alert and ready for the day.\nPeople who have a coffee allergy will have a reaction when they are exposed to the bean. Someone who is sensitive to or has an intolerance to caffeine or something else in coffee may also experience symptoms. It is important to know the difference between these conditions.\nDoctors can help people with suspected allergies or sensitivities to coffee find a solution to their specific problems.\nAn adverse reaction can be caused by the dust from coffee beans before they are roasted.\nAllergic reactions to drinking coffee are very rare.\nAccording to a study posted to International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, the dust from green coffee beans causes an allergic reaction in some of those who work with the beans. No recent medical literature mentions allergic reactions to drinking coffee, though rare cases have occurred in the past.\nAn allergic reaction caused by food, such as coffee beans, is actually due to an immune system response. The immune system recognizes compounds in the cells of coffee as invaders.\nThe immune system then responds to coffee in a similar way to how it would respond to pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. It releases protective compounds, such as histamine, to isolate and destroy the intruding coffee. The symptoms of a coffee allergy are the result of this process.\nClick here for more general information about coffee.\nA true coffee allergy can cause serious symptoms in the body, usually within the first hours after it has been drunk. Symptoms can affect many areas of the body and will usually get worse over time.\nSevere allergic reactions may lead to anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Anaphylaxis can cause swelling of the throat and mouth, blocking off the airways, while also adversely affecting the heart rate and blood pressure.\nAnyone who experiences any of these symptoms should get medical attention right away. People who have a coffee allergy and have taken antihistamine medications or epinephrine should still seek medical attention to avoid any potential complications.\nMany people with coffee sensitivities mistakenly think that they are allergic to it. Sensitivity to coffee can create its own problematic symptoms, but they are usually not life-threatening.\nFeelings of anxiety, unease, or irritability after drinking coffee may indicate a coffee sensitivity.\nSymptoms caused by sensitivity to coffee will usually go away if the person stops drinking coffee.\nPeople who are sensitive to coffee may have a gastrointestinal upset or symptoms connected to other issues may be getting worse. For example, coffee can make heartburn and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) worse. The caffeine in coffee can relax the sphincter at the lower end of the food pipe, causing stomach acid to leak up and irritate it.\nAllergies may be confused with the symptoms caused by having too much caffeine or sensitivity to caffeine. Many people who get sick from drinking coffee are simply seeing the effect of caffeine sensitivity.\nTypically, the recommended caffeine consumption for adults is limited to 400 milligrams (mg) per day. This is around 4 small cups of home-brewed coffee. After that, many people will start experiencing symptoms.\nPeople who do not have caffeine regularly, or those that are sensitive to caffeine, may experience symptoms after relatively small amounts of caffeine, such as 1 cup of coffee or tea.

Joining them in the office are smart assistant chatbots, which are being integrated into a variety of enterprise applications.\nNow, Cisco wants to bring the power of voice-activated A.I. smarts to conference rooms with its Spark Assistant.\nThe service is the result of Cisco\u2019s $125 million acquisition of MindMeld earlier this year. With Spark Assistant, the startup\u2019s conversational A.I. tools will be incorporated into Cisco\u2019s Spark Room Series video conference displays.\nCisco plans to add features in the future, interacting with users both inside and outside of the meeting room. This includes the ability to find and book available rooms, suggest relevant documents ahead of time, enable screen sharing, record discussions and take meeting notes.\nThe smart assistant will initially be rolled out to a small group of Spark Room Series early next year. A phased rollout will provide Cisco with feedback, and help to improve accuracy and usability, the company said in a blog post.\nThe capabilities of Spark Assistant bear similarities to Microsoft\u2019s plans to bring cognitive capabilities to its Teams group messaging platform. Along with announcing plans to merge its Skype for Business platform with Teams, Microsoft stated that improved A.I. capabilities will highlight relevant documents prior to meetings, record and transcribe conversations, and subsequently add notes and transcriptions to Teams channels.\nAlan Lepofsky, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, said that A.I. assistants are increasingly being tailored to specific use cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen voice-enabled assistants specific to devices and operating systems, but now we\u2019re starting to see application-specific helpers,\u201d said Alan Lepofsky, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. \u201cThese in-app-assistants have more specific domain expertise than their general A.I. counterparts. This is analogous to the medical world, where you have general physicians and then more specialized experts.\"\nThe advantage of A.I. assistants designed for more targeted use cases is they can be better trained to perform specific tasks.

New machinery came into use, different types of coal seams were tackled and the form of dust the miners inhaled, usually silica, became far more deadly. Silica dust is known to be nearly 20 times more toxic than carbon-based coal dust. But the welfare of the miners was ignored. Attempts to regulate working conditions that accounted for new dangers went nowhere.\nAccording to an official at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the institute was at first skeptical of reports from coal-mining areas. It was only when a radiologist from Kentucky went to NIOSH and spent a day showing them recent chest X-rays of miners that it was understood the problem was real.

People at lower risk who have 1 or 2 small tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up evaluation in 5-10 years. Your report would indicate the nature of your polyps, and you could then have a discussion with your doctor to decide how often you should be screened.\nHow often should I have a colonoscopy?"}

Nazarbayev, who holds the title of \u201cleader of the nation\u201d and has painted himself as the country\u2019s founding father, reflected on his achievements in office, particularly navigating the economic and geopolitical chaos during the collapse of the Soviet Union and enshrining Kazakhstan as a member of the international community.\n\u201cI think that the key message for people outside of Kazakhstan is that Kazakhstan remains business as usual in terms of its foreign-policy priorities and in terms of domestic-policy priorities,\u201d Roman Vassilenko, Kazakhstan\u2019s deputy foreign minister, told Foreign Policy.\nWhile Nazarbayev leaves behind a legacy as an adept statesman who carefully balanced relations with superpowers like China, Russia, and the United States and saw living standards rise in the Central Asian country, his resignation comes against the backdrop of economic stagnation and growing discontent at home with his autocratic government.\nProtests in February over the death of several children in an apartment fire while their parents worked night shifts became a lightning rod for simmering public grievances over endemic corruption and dimming economic opportunities in the country. The mounting pressure led Nazarbayev to publicly rebuke his cabinet before announcing its dissolution in late February in a move designed to head off growing public resentment towards the government.\nIn announcing his resignation, Nazarbayev again appears to be getting out in front of popular anger over Kazakhstan\u2019s dimming domestic future.\nBy exiting the office of the president willingly, said Anceschi, Nazarbayev is able to play a central role managing the behind-the-scenes process of determining his successor, especially given the array of powers he will continue to command. This means that Nazarbayev can still play a substantial role in directing Kazakhstan\u2019s future, especially in foreign affairs, where he maintains strategic working relationships with the leaders of the country\u2019s powerful neighbors\u2014Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nazarbayev also has good relations with Washington and was invited to the White House by U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2018.\nNazarbayev, the son of a shepherd, worked his way up through the Communist Party and became a rising star in politics in the 1980s, when the country, then part of the Soviet Union, was ruled by a gerontocracy. As the leader of a newly independent Kazakhstan beginning in 1991, he managed to successfully navigate a series of crises that threatened his fledgling state. The new country was the world\u2019s ninth largest and was rich with oil reserves, but Kazakhstan also inherited a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union. Nazarbayev helped solidify Kazakhstan\u2019s independence by transferring the nuclear stockpiles to Russia, with help from the"}

Ralph Norman (R-SC) pulled out a loaded gun and placed it on a table for several minutes. He argued after the fact that the firearm\u2019s presence had made the attendees safer.\nBut that\u2019s not what people who went to the event had to say about Norman\u2019s bewildering action.\n\u201cRep. Norman\u2019s behavior today was a far cry from what responsible gun ownership looks like,\u201d said Lori Freeman, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, who attended the event and spoke with Norman, according to the Washington Post.\nThere is a statute that makes it illegal to \u201cpresent or point at another person a loaded or unloaded firearm,\u201d and the South Carolina Democratic Party is calling for an investigation.\nFormer U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head \u2014 and miraculously survived \u2014 at a constituent event at a Safeway grocery store in Tucson, Arizona in 2011. Norman\u2019s argument is that if armed, he could have prevented an assassination attempt. Yet, facts at the scene in Tucson that day refute the \u201cmore guns are better\u201d argument pushed by gun advocates like Norman.\nJoe Zamudio, an armed bystander ran onto the scene with his safety off, saw a man with a gun and pushed him into the wall, thinking he was the shooter. But the man Zamudio thought was the shooter was just another bystander, also armed, who was actually attempting to subdue the actual shooter.\nWith so many guns already at the site of the shooting \u2014 and with the gunman giving no warning opening fire on Giffords, it is highly doubtful that an armed bystander \u2014 even a gun-toting congressman \u2014 could have affected the outcome.\nIt is hardly the first case in which a conservative politician has brandished or mishandled firearms in public. Here are a few of the many such cases.\nThe incident generated a complaint to the local police department, which said that it was not a crime, even though there is a law against possessing a firearm while taking part in a public rally. Because the Moore event was ticketed on private property, and therefore not a public event, it was not considered a misdemeanor. It is not known if the weapon was loaded at the time.\nIt was not the only time during that campaign that Moore pulled out his wife\u2019s handgun at a political event; He did the same thing at a candidates\u2019 forum in Valley, Alabama in August.\nAccording to a CNN report, which is not the Onion, Sen.

McConnell had, however, done plenty for the NRA and the gun industry at a policy level in the Senate over the years.\nIn 2006, Delegate Jack Reid of Virginia attempted to unload his handgun in his office but instead he fired a round into a door.

Known for her lyricism and concession to misery, Pizarnik wrote of terror, suffering, estrangement, and death, but also of love and tenderness. She wrote seven books of poetry and one book of prose before ending her life at age 36 in 1972.\nUpon finishing this initial section, Works and Nights (1965), the first-time Pizarnik reader might feel as if they are somewhat prepared for section two, Extracting the Stone of Madness (1968). They are not.\nThe title poem references a circa 1494 painting by Hieronymus Bosch titled The Cure of Folly (or The Extraction of the Stone of Madness, or Cutting the Stone) depicting a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled deep into the skull of a \u201cfool\u201d\u2014a medieval practice once believed to relieve mental disorders.\nThe bad light is near and nothing is real. When I think of all that I\u2019ve read of the spirit \u2014 when I closed my eyes, I saw luminous bodies turning in the mist, on the site of tenuous dwellings. Don\u2019t be afraid, no one will come after you. All the grave robbers have gone. Silence, always silence; the gold coins of sleep.\nI speak the way I speak inside. Not with the voice intent on sounding human, but with the other one, the one that insists I\u2019m still a creature of the forest.\nIn this phenomenally eerie section, Pizarnik\u2019s poems turn into feverish dreamscapes occupied by solitary women dressed in blue or red, fetuses of scorpions, mirrors, lilacs, and sorcery. Similar motifs extend into the next section of the book, A Musical Hell (1971), which references another painting by Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights. This title poem refers to the \u201chell\u201d panel of Bosch\u2019s famous triptych, depicting musicians playing on instruments that are simultaneously used for torture.\nLike in Bosch\u2019s hell, the horror in Extracting the Stone of Madness is inescapable. Every Pizarnik poem is a step down a phantom staircase, an insomniac descent leading to the final text of the book: a poem that was found written in chalk on a blackboard in the poet\u2019s workroom after her suicide.\nSo why should anyone read this disturbing piece of literature, let alone award it with one of the finest translation prizes in the U.S.? Because Pizarnik\u2019s poetry, and Siegert\u2019s rendition of it, is inescapable: not due to its terror, but due to its mastery."}

Yes, a captive dolphin in a hotel's small lagoon raises appreciation for the animal but a dolphin-sensitive tour on the ocean, educates while reaching for the higher ecotourism bar.\nThe most dedicated ecotourists also engage in green travel practices: for example, conserving water at the hotel, renting a hybrid car, using public transportation or bicycling; bringing their own shopping bags or purchasing environmentally friendly cloth bags at the destination. Deciding where to stay is another choice that is influenced by the level of eco-sensitivity.\nAn ecotourism purist, for example, might restrict accommodations to establishments or campgrounds that are nearly 100 percent sustainable or to a very large degree are protecting their habitat. For example, the Hacienda Baru Lodge raises funds to support its Hacienda Baru National Wildlife Refuge, which the organized developed and protects and would otherwise have been deforested for cattle ranches. The lodge also provides jobs to locals.\nAnother ecotourist may prefer the pampering of a luxury resort, but only one that also makes ecofriendly lists, such as the Mauna Lani Resort (maunalani.com) on Hawaii Island, which \"Conde Nast Traveler\" named as one of the world's best eco-friendly, luxury, beachfront resorts.\nThe destination needn't be exotic and teeming with rainforest animals to attract the ecotourist. For example, \"Mother Earth News: in a top 10 list of ecotourism destinations includes Inn Serendipity in Brownville, Wisconsin, (innserendipity.com/), an aged farmhouse transformed into a bed-and-breakfast, using sustainable energy and adorned with organic gardens.\nNo matter the travel practices or accommodations, ecotourists want to see nature, and dedicated ecotourists use discretion in selecting tours and destinations that promise the wildlife watching opportunities or outdoor adventures. At some venues you see, \u201ceco\u201d added to all outdoor activities, regardless of whether the activities support the environment or local culture. This green-washing is something the more conscientious and educated ecotourist will notice.\nBlankenship, Cindy. \"Levels of Ecotourism.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/levels-ecotourism-108017.html.

The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can include rashes, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, inflammation, and miscarriage. One third of the patients die of kidney failure. Little is known about the origin and the pathogenesis of this disease. Diagnosis is difficult because many symptoms are common with other diseases. The hallmark of Lupus is that the body produces antibodies against its own DNA, certain proteins of the nucleus and of white blood cells. The course of the disease is characterized by flares which are often triggered by infections. After a flare the health of the patient improves but often there are sequelae, resulting in a continuous exacerbation of the disease.\nScientists of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology suspected that an immune mechanism that was only recently discovered by them, plays a key role in Lupus: During an infection, white blood cells are stimulated and extrude nets in which they trap and kill pathogens (fig. 1). This NET (an acronym for Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) is composed of exactly those components against which a Lupus patient produces antibodies: DNA, as well as proteins of the nucleus and the white blood cells (fig. 2). In co-operation with clinical scientists from the University of Erlangen, the Max Planck scientists could show for the first time that, in contrast to healthy persons, a part of the Lupus patients could not degrade NETs after the infection.\nThe scientists also discovered that NETs are degraded by the enzyme DNase-1, a protein which normally is found in the blood. Lupus patients, however, either lack this enzyme or their DNase-1 is blocked. Further examination of this patient group revealed that the remains of NETs together with the auto-antibodies are deposited in the kidneys of SLE patients. Indeed, the scientists showed a strong correlation between the inability to degrade NETs in Lupus and a high risk of kidney failure. These results provide a starting point for the development of a test that might allow an early diagnosis and treatment of these high risk patients.\nZychlinsky, Arturo. \"Rescue NET For Lupus Patients.\" Medical News Today.

To determine the toxicity and cell viability of this compound in-vivo we present, herein, a study using Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of light, the new photosensitizer shows no discernible effects to fly larvae at various concentrations of compound and stages of larval development. When the larvae were fed the photosensitizer it was observed, by fluorescence microscopy, that the compound passes through the cell membrane and localizes in the cytosol at lower concentrations and the nucleus at slightly higher concentrations indicating that the compound is not immediately metabolized.\nYoho, Joshua; Stroh, Colette; Swavey, Shawn; and Kango-Singh, Madhuri, \"Toxicity and Localization Studies of a Potential Photodynamic Therapy Agent in Drosophila\" (2014).

In that time its growth has been exponential: One million users, 2,000 dealers, and a healthy selection of captive and indirect lenders.\nIn fact the company has some significant backers. Earlier this year, Volkswagen Credit purchased a $30 million stake, joining Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. AutoGravity has also partnered with the top five dealer groups.\nIt comes together within a mobile experience designed to take car buyers from research to offer in just minutes. Indeed, if you haven\u2019t heard of AutoGravity and you\u2019re in the market for a car, you probably should know, given the app\u2019s popularity.\nHere\u2019s how it works: Shoppers download the app, where they browse cars and select up to four vehicles from actual dealer inventory then request loan or lease offers. The buyer then goes to the dealership, finalizes the transaction, and drives off the lot. Dealers and lenders pay a fee for each transaction, so the experience is free to consumers. According to Serge Vartanov, chief marketing officer of AutoGravity, the value of that type of service is that it makes buying a car more convenient, and eliminates what he says is \u201cambiguity\u201d in financing by linking monthly payments to actual cars.\nThe southern California startup helps car buyers browse for cars, request loan or lease offers, then go to the dealership to finalize the deal.\nBut AutoGravity doesn\u2019t go the distance, and isn\u2019t financially transparent in terms of the final deal. The buyer still must visit the dealership to wrap things up, and that means tasks like negotiating a final price with the sales person must still be done face-to-face. In addition, offered loans include added finance costs like a dealer reserve fee, which the dealer gets for arranging financing between buyer and lender. In addition, shoppers will not escape the aftermarket sales pitch (think: paint protection).\nSo while the makes the first phase of the buying experience more convenient, it doesn\u2019t solve the most pressing consumer pain points: negotiating the deal, finishing vehicle financing, and evaluating F&I add-on products. Those elements are still a part of the showroom experience \u2013 no Amazon-like e-commerce experience here.\nWhile the AutoGravity app improves upon the painstaking process of car-buying, it doesn't completely eliminate the headache inducing hurdles of negotiating at the final stretch with a dealership salesman.\nRight now for AutoGravity, however, the focus is on the mobile experience, and in making the experience inclusive, convenient and intuitive. Ultimately the app, along with a growing crowd of competing solutions, offers a mobile spin on a broken retail experience because consumers clamor for it.\nAccording to the J.D. Power and Associates\u2019 2017 New Autoshopper Study, 56 percent of automotive internet shoppers conduct research on a mobile device; the average internet shopper spends 13 hours conducting automotive research online, of which more than four hours is spent on mobile devices.\nVartanov considers the company\u2019s sudden ascension that to be, in part, evidence of a \u201cgroundbreaking evolution\u201d in home entertainment and online shopping (think: gaming and Amazon) that has finally made its way to automotive retail.\n\u201cIt has become clear that the next generation of"}

But it\u2019s not that likely. The daguerrotype made its way from France to New York City in 1839 when Louis Daguerre perfected the technology. Although we know that daguerrotypes of things like City Hall Park were taken and publicly displayed, none have survived.\nBefore the above photo was discovered at a small auction in New England, the oldest known photo of New York City was a daguerrotype of Chatham Street in downtown Manhattan, taken between 1848 and 1853.

But what are practical ways teachers can incorporate these ideas into their lessons?\nGenius Hours are one strategy many teachers are incorporating. It's an idea adapted from Google and what Daniel Pink originally called \"Fed-Ex Days.\"\nToday, Rebecca Mieliwocki, Gallit Zvi, Denise Krebs, Yvette Jackson, Veronica McDermott, Amy Sandvold, Josh Patterson and Maurice J. Elias share their responses. You can listen to a 10-minute conversation I had with Rebecca, Gallit, Yvette and Veronica on my BAM! Radio Show. You can also find a list of, and links to, previous shows here.\nI've used versions of a Genius Hour in my own classroom. You can find lots of practical resources at The Best Resources For Applying \"Fed Ex Days\" (Also Known As \"Genius Hours\") To Schools.\nBefore I offer an answer, I just have to share how transformative Genius Hour was for my teaching, my students and my classroom, and me. If you have any way at all of trying this, even if it becomes a Genius Week or a daily Genius Minute, please DO it. You won't regret it. I promise.\nI have always cared about creating a student-centered classroom where there were choices for kids, tiered assignments, circling back and re-teaching for strugglers, and opportunities to stretch. However, even with all of this baked in to my teaching, I struggled to get 100 percent engagement from my students until Genius Hour. After hearing all of the buzz and success stories from friends and colleagues who were trying it, I decided to wade in myself.\nEvery Friday for an entire semester, I would turn over the reins of research, learning, and doing to my 7th grade students. We began by spending three class periods introducing the concept of Genius Hour and self-directed learning, having them select some of their personal passions, and then narrowing it down to a focus question about one of those areas that they'd like to spend 17 more hours exploring. To excite them about the idea I shared several TED talks by young people who have set out to change the world by small, simple acts that anyone could do. I wanted them to feel empowered by the freedom to choose what to work on, not afraid. Focus questions had to be approved by three people (two classmates and myself) before they were set free to the discovery phase. Questions could not be Google-able, could not be yes or no questions, and finding the answer required about 15 hours of thinking, work, and research. In other words, focus questions were tricky and needed to be just right in order to propel this project.\nOnce their focus question was approved, students came to class each Friday, took out their Genius folders, grabbed an iPad from our cart, and began work. Each Friday would find my students engaged in different activities such as reading, researching, testing, drawing, building, or practicing. Depending on the stage of their work, I might have 36 different kids doing 36 different things. About five minutes before the period ended, they had to log their activity for the day and list one next step they'd need to accomplish before the next work session. Three times per semester, I'd send out a blog question about their progress through our KidBlog site, and they'd"}

Karina was \u201ccut into pieces\u201d that day on the train tracks in Orsk, Orenburg when she sacrificed her life to stand in front of a freight train to get the selfie.\nBecause the little girl died because of her vanity, social media published an outpouring of grief and sadness for her loss.

That's expected to generate $500 million in upgrades.\nThe transit upgrades would have to be finished before developers are allowed to occupy the properties.\nLandmark buildings in the area \u2014 like Grand Central Terminal and St. Patrick's Cathedral \u2014 will also be able to sell their air rights to developers, with at least 20% of the price going to a fund that will pay for improvements such as pedestrian plazas and wider medians.\nThe details of that plan sparked controversy, since the city wanted to set a minimum contribution of at least $78 per square feet to the fund, whereas real estate owners opposed a minimum.\nIn the final version, air rights sellers will have to kick in $61.49 per square foot or 20%, whichever is more.\nReal Estate Board of New York President John Banks blasted the deal, calling it a \"step backward.\"\n\"Today's agreement is a missed opportunity to ensure more, rather than less, commercial development. As a result, it is less likely that the public improvements that are needed in greater East Midtown will be achieved,\" he said.\nThe Archdiocese of New York also said it was \"disappointed\" in the decision.\nDeputy Mayor Alicia Glen said the final figure \"gives us the assurance that the public needs that there will be money coming into this fund immediately and over the next decade to make sure the public gets the benefit.\"\nThe rezoning also delivers a major boon to Pfizer, whose building is included even though it doesn't line up with the rest of the district, and will see its property value soar as it looks to sell the site. The company has committed to remain in Manhattan when it moves to a new site, though that promise is not legally binding.\n\"We're evaluating sites in Manhattan for our potential new headquarters,\" said Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion."}

{"idx": "18956", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For Baby Boomers and Generation X, the summer job was a rite of passage. Today's teenagers have other priorities. Teens are likeliest to be working in July, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that's not seasonally adjusted. In July of last year, 43 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds were either working or looking for a job. That's 10 points lower than in July 2006. In 1988 and 1989, the July labor force participation rate for teenagers nearly hit 70 percent.\nWhether you're looking at summer jobs or at teen employment year-round, the work trends for teenagers show a clear pattern over the last three decades. When recessions hit, in the early 1990s, early 2000s, and from 2007 to 2009, teen labor participation rates plunge. As the economy recovers, though, teen labor doesn't bounce back. The BLS expects the teen labor force participation rate to drop below 27 percent in 2024, or 30 points lower than the peak seasonally adjusted rate in 1989.\nWhy aren't teens working? Lots of theories have been offered: They're being crowded out of the workforce by older Americans, now working past 65 at the highest rates in more than 50 years. Immigrants are competing with teens for jobs; a 2012 study found that less educated immigrants affected employment for U.S. native-born teenagers far more than for native-born adults.\nParents are pushing kids to volunteer and sign up for extracurricular activities instead of working, to impress college admission counselors. College-bound teens aren't looking for work because the money doesn't go as far as it used to. \"Teen earnings are low and pay little toward the costs of college,\" the BLS noted this year. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Elite private universities charge tuition of more than $50,000.\nOr maybe, as cranky old people have asserted for generations, teenagers are just getting lazy.\nA recent BLS analysis offers another theory, backed up by solid data. It appears that millions of teenagers aren't working because they're studying instead.\nOver the last few decades, education has taken up more of teenagers' time, as school districts lengthen both the school day and the academic year. During the school year, academic loads have gotten heavier. Education is also eating up teenagers' summers. Teens aren't going to summer school just because they failed a class and need to catch up. They're also enrolling in enrichment courses and taking courses for college credit.\nIn July of last year, more than two in five 16- to 19-year-olds were enrolled in school. That's four times times as many as were enrolled in 1985, BLS data show.\nStudents have more to learn in their four years of high school. In 1982, fewer than one in 10 high school graduates had completed at least four years of English classes, three years of math, science, and social science, and two years of a foreign language. By 2009, the most recent data in the U.S. Digest of Education Statistics, the share of grads taking those classes was almost 62 percent.\nHigh school students aren't just taking more classes.

This wasn\u2019t the first (or probably the last) time that I had done something like this. It was more like the twentieth time that I\u2019d left something-a book, a pair of socks, a shoe, a set of headphones, a towel, a lock, you name it- behind, only to discover the loss the next day or the next week, depending upon how regularly I happened to be working out at the time. I usually take some comfort in rummaging through the huge pile of clothing and workout gear in the lost and found boxes (there\u2019s too much for one box!) and reassure myself that at least I\u2019m not the only forgetful one around here.\nOn this occasion, rather than turn around and go back to the club (it had after all been a long day), I decided to save myself the drive and the 25 minutes that the round-trip would take and pick up the jacket the next day when I returned to the club. But of course I didn\u2019t go back the next day. Or the next. And when I did go back, guess what? That\u2019s right, no jacket. So I got to save myself a trip but it cost me a jacket.\nUnfortunately, these \u2018situations\u2019 seem to be occurring with disturbing (to me) frequency. Most of the time I chalk them up to the inevitable consequences of a full schedule and a busy life, and fortunately the losses are usually minor and at worst, inconvenient. Still, I hate to lose stuff, particularly when the loss is due to my own negligence. I often tell myself that it\u2019s good practice for me to strengthen my ability to practice non-attachment and letting go, which I think it is. I\u2019m getting so much practice these days that pretty soon I\u2019ll be able to experience losses without even blinking an eye, which is a good thing since all things, including life itself are impermanent. As many of us know, however, there is a world of difference between believing something to be true and knowing it in your bones.\nShortly after my experience of losing my jacket I got to have another experience that help me to \u2018get\u2019 the teaching about loss on a deeper level. Sometimes we have to experience things ourselves in order to get it. If we\u2019re lucky, however, we can get it through the experience of another. In this case it was the latter.\nWhen Linda and I were staying with a friend in Santa Barbara during a weekend in which we were teaching a couples\u2019 workshop.

{"idx": "18969", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Today was Apple\u2019s (s aapl) iPhone 3.0 Software event, and iPhone users will now have to think up a bunch of other things to moan about in its wake. Among the laundry list of over 100 new feature additions are some of the most frequently talked about omissions, including Cut, Copy & Paste, MMS, landscape keyboard support for all main Apple applications, and push notification for third-party apps.\nBut that\u2019s just a taste of what was revealed at Cupertino today. Developers will probably be a very happy crowd, since the new developer\u2019s SDK gives them access to over 1,000 new APIs.\nThat includes the above mentioned push notification API, which allows developers to provide audio, text or badge icon notifications for their apps. Just to be clear, the apps aren\u2019t actually running in the background, which Apple says is too costly in terms of battery life. Instead, updates are pushed from the developers server using Apple\u2019s own notification system.\nOther highlights for developers include Google (s goog) Maps integration, so that maps will open right in the apps, instead of redirecting users outside to the official app. Some apps have tried to get around this by using their own maps, or maps from Yahoo (s yhoo), but the result has been clumsy at best.\nAlso noteworthy is hardware-specific app integration, which allows apps to be designed to work with different peripherals, connected to the iPhone via either the proprietary dock connector or Bluetooth. Demos of how this might work included using the iPhone as an equalizer for a stereo dock, and as a blood glucose monitor with a blood-testing device for diabetics.\nBluetooth can also now be used for peer-to-peer support, allowing iPhones to communicate with each other for multiplayer gaming, and other applications. App developer Smule showed off using this to perform a musical duet with their new Leaf Trombone instrument application.\nThe iPhone will also be able to support turn-by-turn navigation when 3.0 is released, although developers will have to provide their own maps due to licensing issues. Still, expect to see Garmin or some of the other big names jump on this bandwagon early.\nLast but not least, apps will be able to offer paid content, upgrades, and subscriptions from within, sidestepping the App Store altogether. This means the doors are open to a whole host of new business models, which could decrease a lot of the current clutter with regards to different versions of apps depending on price, and the litany of stand-alone book and comic apps. EA (s erts) demoed the Sims 3 to show how this system can be used in terms of additional downloadable content in games.\nDevelopers aside, iPhone end-users will be pleased to find that many of their prayers have been answered. A full, cross-app, platform-wide Copy/Paste solution is present in 3.0, and it works exactly like Kevin Rose described yesterday. HTML copy is supported, as is image cutting, copying, and pasting, and you can now paste multiple images into an email as attachments.\nThe landscape keyboard can now be used in Mail, Notes and the new Messaging app, which replaces SMS. Good news for the chubby-fingered, like myself. This is a huge plus, since it\u2019ll decrease some app store clutter and free up some space on my home screen.\nMessaging now supports MMS (iPhone 3G only), including picture, audio, contact and location messages.

{"idx": "18970", "prompt": "Continue the following text: On 4 February 2004, this rather clunky announcement launched an invention conceived in the dorm room of a Harvard student called Mark Zuckerberg, and intended to be an improvement on the so-called face books that US universities traditionally used to collect photos and basic information about their students. From the vantage point of 2019, Thefacebook \u2013 as it was then known \u2013 looks familiar, but also strange. Pages were coloured that now familiar shade of blue, and \u201cfriends\u201d were obviously a central element of what was displayed. However, there was little on show from the wider world: the only photos were people\u2019s profile pictures, and there was no ever-changing news feed.\nEverything on offer was centred on the lives of students: first at Harvard, then at Columbia, Stanford and Yale. On the face of it, the focus was campus dating and a feature whereby users could send each other \u201cpokes\u201d, whose meaning was open to interpretation, thus increasing the fun.\nEveryone, it seemed, was performing, and the basic idea was to do as much performing as possible. At the end of 2004, Thefacebook reached a million users; in September 2006, having renamed itself Facebook, it moved beyond campuses and high schools, and opened itself up to anyone over 13 with an email address. But a core tenet of its Harvard beginnings remained: the imperative for users to present the world with the most flattering impression of themselves.\nFifteen years after Facebook\u2019s birth, it has 2.2 billion users, Zuckerberg sits on a fortune of about $55bn (\u00a342bn), and this week the company posted a record profit of $6.88bn for the final three months of 2018. And we know one other thing for sure: tangled up in its success is the fact that people lie about themselves on Facebook, as they do on other social media platforms. In 2016, when the market research firm Custard surveyed 2,000 people in the UK, it found that only 18% of them said their Facebook profile accurately represented them, 31% said the face they presented on Facebook boiled down to \u201cpretty much my life but without the boring bits\u201d, and 14% said Facebook made them look \u201cmuch more\u201d socially active than they were. Men, it seemed, were more likely than women to knowingly depart from the truth: 43% admitted to fabricating some aspect of their online selves.\nThat said, there is plenty of evidence of the same everyday deceit on the other side of the gender divide. Six years ago, the market research company OnePoll found that a third of women it surveyed admitted to \u201cdishonesty\u201d on social media. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month, and almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30% of women lied about doing something when they were really home alone, and 20% were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs.\nOn the face of it, this may not seem that revelatory. It is, perhaps, in the nature of our relationships with other human beings that we work desperately hard on our outward presentation, and sometimes fall into a kind of performance that leads inexorably towards fibs.\nHowever, the Facebook age marks a break from traditional human behaviour in key aspect. In the past, we could regularly take a break from acting, and revert to some sense of our private, authentic selves. Now, as we constantly prod at our"}

Phillips said Morgan flew in early this morning from Michigan and began his climb.\nPhillips said he Morgan was outfitted with leather hiking boots, crampons, a hiking pole, a daypack and a bicycle helmet -- less-than-ideal equipment for summiting Mount Hood.\nHe did not have an ice ax, considered standard mountaineering equipment because it can be used to stop a fall on slippery surfaces.\nPhillips also said the sunny, clear conditions on the mountain today may have made climbing tricky.\n\"As the weather warms on the mountain, the snow changes texture,\" Phillips said. \"You just have to be really prepared for the surface changes.\"\nMorgan's fall was estimated variously between 300 and 600 feet.\nA member of Portland Mountain Rescue already on the mountain, reached Morgan first, followed by American Medical Response's Reach and Treat Team.

It\u2019s the worst time to have to do this because, well, you are going through a crisis\u2026..who thinks clearly at this time??\nFor us, the decision to send our son Dan to a residential program for OCD during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of college almost seemed like a no-brainer. Just to clarify: Residential treatment programs are different from inpatient programs, at least for most insurance purposes. Dan entered the program voluntarily and could leave anytime he wanted to.\nBack to the no-brainer part. This program that Dan attended is world-renowned, highly regarded, and intensive. The staff assured us Dan would improve enough to successfully return to college that fall, which was his goal. Dan was not only willing to go to this treatment program, he wanted to go. He couldn\u2019t wait to go! So why on earth wouldn\u2019t we send him, especially when that was what all of the experts recommended?\nIn retrospect, I think we should have explored our options more, but as I stated above, we were in crisis mode. In hindsight, perhaps a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP \u2013 which is basically the same as a residential program aside from one very important fact: you go home at night).\nIn regard to the residential program, I really thought that as Dan\u2019s parents, our relationship with the staff would be one of collaboration. You know, all of us working together to help Dan. But that was not the case. Dan was over eighteen and considered an adult. The fact that he was a nineteen year old suffering from severe OCD and not really in the best condition to be making life-changing decisions did not seem to matter. Not only were we not consulted when decisions were being made, we were often not even informed of these decisions. So it was fine for us to pay for Dan\u2019s treatment; we just couldn\u2019t know anything about it. And when we did press for information, we were often regarded as pushy, overbearing parents.\nSo this is something to be aware of. At a PHP, we would have had more contact with Dan and would have had the opportunity to be more involved in important decisions.\nOf course, what is right for one person (and family) is not necessarily right for another. If possible, the best thing to do is to research all options: individual weekly ERP (exposure and response prevention) therapy, intensive ERP therapy (more days, more hours), partial hospitalization, or residential treatment. There are pros and cons to each of them, but they all have one thing in common: ERP Therapy. And, in a nutshell, that\u2019s what is most important."}

The White House did not respond for a request for comment.\nThe signees include retired Marine Gens. Joseph Hoar and Charles Krulak, Army Gen. David Maddox and Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton. The letter was released through Human Rights First, which said that all the signees are part of a larger nonpartisan group of retired generals and admirals who work with the organization to oppose torture and promote prisoner treatment policies consistent with the Geneva Conventions.\n\"As retired flag officers of the United States Armed Forces, we believe that our nation is on its strongest footing when our defense and security policies adhere to our values and obligations under domestic and international law,\" the group said in the letter.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee voted in early April to release its abbreviated -- nearly 500-page -- declassified report on the CIA program. The full report, which is more than 6,000 pages, is being held pending redaction and declassification. That process itself has come under criticism since it is the CIA that would be doing the redacting.\nThe retirees, in their letter, told Obama that it is a conflict of interest to allow the CIA to redact a report that alleges its own officials, including some still on the job, \"authorized [the] brutal interrogation methods and systematically misled the White House, Congress, Department of Justice, and American people about the facts and consequences of using those methods.\"\nThe \"best chance\" of avoiding a scenario in which a future president rescinds Obama's executive order banning torture, the group says, \"is for the Intelligence Committee's report -- which calls into question the morality, legality, and effectiveness of the CIA program -- to be made public with minimal redactions.\"\nThe Senate report panned the CIA program and said the information gathered through torture could have been gotten through other means from the 20 cases it investigated.\nThis has been disputed by former CIA officials, including former Director Gen. Michael Hayden, while former deputy director and sometimes acting director under Obama, Michael Morrell, has never fully rejected the usefulness of \"enhanced interrogation.\"\nCorinne Duffy, spokeswoman for Human Rights First, said the retired generals and admirals worked in 2005 with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to pass the Detainee Treatment Act that reinforced the ban on torture and other cruel and degrading treatment. It also established the Army Field Manual as the single standard of interrogation for all prisoners in DOD custody."}

Web reservations and bookings through travel management companies are also now available. Inbound travelers to DFW can drive their own Silvercar off the lot beginning January 14, 2013.\n\"We're thrilled to debut the Silvercar concept at DFW Airport in the coming weeks,\" said Silvercar chief executive officer Luke Schneider. \"The integration of Web, wireless, mobile and vehicle technologies helps Silvercar eliminate critical friction points in the car rental process; our pledge to travelers is a better car, and a better car rental experience, each and every time.\"\nOnce through the airport terminal, Silvercar customers will board DFW's shuttle service to the consolidated car rental facility. The similarities, however, end there. Silvercar customers won't find check-in lines or traditional counters; rather the entire customer experience is technology-enabled. Customers place reservations, select and unlock a vehicle, and even receive their receipt through a seamless smartphone user interface.\nUsers' contact, payment and personal preference information will be stored in a Silvercar profile on a secure cloud server. Previously loaded preferences \u2013 such as itinerary destinations \u2013 can sync to Audi's in-dash multimedia interface after unlocking the vehicle.

{"idx": "18979", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The NFL announced Friday that it will not suspend Washington Redskins linebacker Reuben Foster after he was twice arrested twice for domestic violence last year. The league found that Foster did not violate its personal conduct policy, but he will be fined two game checks for violating conditions that the league required of him after he was suspended for the first two games of last season.\nFriday\u2019s announcement means Foster, 25, will be eligible to play next season and can take part in the team\u2019s offseason conditioning program, which starts Monday. He had been on the NFL\u2019s Commissioner Exempt List since his domestic violence arrest in November, when he was still a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Charges were eventually dropped in both cases.\nThe 49ers released Foster after he was arrested Nov. 24 in Tampa, and the Redskins claimed him on waivers three days after that. Washington\u2019s coaches and executives knew that Foster would not play for the rest of the year but were hopeful that he could eventually return and viewed the transaction as a potential opportunity to add an impact player at a bargain price.\nThe move drew intense criticism from many fans and observers, who were angered by the Redskins\u2019 decision to add a player with two domestic violence charges in a year.\nIn the Tampa incident, Foster\u2019s girlfriend told police that he hit her during an argument at the team hotel the night before a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Those charges were dropped in January. In a statement Friday, the NFL said it did not find evidence that Foster violated its personal conduct policy.\nFoster was suspended for the first two games last year, while still a member of the 49ers, following his first domestic violence arrest and a weapons charge in California, as well as an arrest for marijuana possession in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The domestic violence charges were dropped, the weapons charge was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, and the marijuana charge was dropped when he entered a diversion program for first-time offenders. When the league suspended him, it said the punishment was for the weapons and drug offenses.\nHis two-year NFL career has been a mix of on-field promise and off-field trouble. When healthy and not suspended, Foster has shown glimpses of being one of the league\u2019s most talented interior linebackers. Despite battling ankle injuries during his rookie season in San Francisco, Foster had 72 tackles in 10 games. Last season, he had 29 tackles in his six starts before his release.\nBut away from the field he has struggled, including being sent home from the 2017 scouting combine after arguing with a hospital employee during a mandatory physical.\nAllen added that the team has \u201cput in place a comprehensive responsibility and accountability plan\u201d to help Foster that includes \u201ca structured living arrangement, weekly meetings with the club player engagement director, weekly meetings with our team chaplain and targeted community service engagements.\"\nWashington was the only team to put in a waiver claim.\nFoster was given a locker at the Redskins\u2019 team facility and began working out with the squad and attending position meetings.

He also talked about his desire to stay in feature films, what it would take for a Samurai Jack movie to get made, and what he loves about animated storytelling. Check out what he had to say after the jump.\nCollider: What were the biggest challenges in taking all of these horror movie monsters and making a family film with them?\nGENNDY TARTAKOVSKY: You have to make the conscious decision not to go to scary-funny. You want to go there right away, but you have to decide, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d The next thing you want to avoid are puns. With a hotel for monsters, you can do a ton of humor like, \u201cOh, this movie is out of the grave,\u201d and all that kind of stuff. That\u2019s good for a laugh, but we really wanted to do a character comedy. For me, doing all the TV stuff and having the experience directing, knowing what you want to make is 90% of it. The rest of it is just guiding everybody on that one path. But, figuring out the path is the difficult part. If I could really close my eyes and watch the whole movie, then directing is easy. But, knowing what that movie is, is the hard part.\nOnce you had all these actors in place for all of the characters, were there any you were most surprised about seeing brought to life?\nTARTAKOVSKY: The most satisfying one is, for sure, Dracula. To really have Dracula feel the way he feels, he feels like a star. But then, the most surprising was probably Quasimodo. At first, I didn\u2019t have a good role for him. We went through a few things, but we just weren\u2019t sure who he was. And then, once Jon Lovitz did these really funny reads and the animators were able to push Quasimodo to this really freaky looking guy, then he really came together and he became really funny. He became a really fun part of the movie.\nDid you have to think a lot about how you would bring Mavis to life, considering that so many young girls would see her as a heroine?\nTARTAKOVSKY: Yeah. It\u2019s always difficult to do girls. The thing about any character is that you want to be sincere. It\u2019s not like you go, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to get myself in a girl mode.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really about that. It was just about, \u201cHow can we make a sincere teenager and not do the standard thing?\u201d It was staying away from that and designing it around Selena, in a way, to make her step into the role in a really easy way. She was young enough that she didn\u2019t have a character that she\u2019s so iconic with [that that\u2019s all you saw]. Mavis could still retain her own identity. That was really challenging.

{"idx": "18984", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A performance of every word of F Scott Fitzgerald's jazz era classic, Gatz lasts a marathon eight hours (with a break for dinner). How do the actors manage it?\nOn paper it looks like punishment: an eight-hour stage production (albeit with a dinner break) during which the entirety of a novel (albeit The Great Gatsby) is read aloud and the scene shifts, inexplicably, between a 1980s office setting and the jazz era of the original. I go to see Gatz at a theatre in downtown Manhattan, as you might visit a disagreeable relative: expecting discomfort and boredom, but feeling virtuous for making the effort. As the lights go down, virtue gives way to dread.\nThe idea for the show came to John Collins 10 or so years ago. He is the founding member of the Elevator Repair Service, an experimental theatre company devoted to making unusual work out of what he calls \"non-dramatic source material. To take something from one medium and make it work in our medium.\" At the time, Collins was thinking about creating a puppet show \"by finding random objects and sticking eyes on them\". Another member of the company happened to be rereading his favourite novel, The Great Gatsby, and, since Collins likes to use whatever is to hand, they started messing around with ideas. Doing a straightforward adaptation was one notion, but then Collins had a brainwave: why not focus on the very thing that most productions would try to disguise: the medium. \"We could try to smooth over it by adapting it into a play. Or we could hit that problem head on and try to stage it as a novel. That was exciting.\"\nI mention all this as further evidence of just how unpromising a proposition Gatz is. Once the idea to present it as a novel was in place, Collins and Scott Shepherd, who plays the lead and is hoarse when I speak to him from yet another marathon performance, started rehearsing in the only space available to them, a roughed-up office above a theatre. Something about the setting made sense. And so, bit by bit, a scenario evolved: of a bored office worker, finding the novel in a filing cabinet and getting slowly, inexorably sucked into it over the course of a single working day. The audience watches in real time as he reads it aloud and various colleagues come over, take the book from him and assume characters in the play, switching back and forth between realities. It is an insane idea. It militates against every commercial principle in the book. It is also, as I discovered when I first saw the show in 2010, heart-stoppingly brilliant.\nThe trepidation of the audience in the first 20 minutes is something everyone in the company is aware of. Collins thinks it actually plays in their favour. Low expectations make the slow realisation that it isn't going to be awful much more powerful. Somewhere around the first hour, as Shepherd's narration gathers pace, you can feel a collective sigh move through the room, and from there on in it's electrifying. His is an extraordinary performance. Such are the physical and mental demands of the role, that the only way he can approach it, Shepherd says, is like a regular day at work. After all, it is set in an office. He cannot process Gatz as a single entity. It is more like performance art than acting.\n\"The show is so big you can't keep it all in your mind. When I go out at the beginning, I'm not thinking about the end or even chapter two. It's like not looking down"}

Short of that, he suggests the FDA might force companies to stop offering e-liquid flavors that appeal to minors, even though many smokers who use e-cigarettes to quit say flavor variety is an important part of that process.\nThe FDA suggested that Juul consider \"revising your current marketing practices to help prevent use by minors\" and \"removing flavored products from the market until those products can be reviewed by FDA.\" More generally, the FDA wants Juul and the other companies to contemplate \"the particular youth appeal of their products,\" which involves features, such as style and convenience, that adults also happen to like.\nThose steps would constrain the ability of e-cigarette companies to reach adult smokers and make vaping less appealing to them. The upshot could be less switching and therefore more smoking-related deaths.\nOn the other side of the public health ledger, there is little reason to think restricting information about electronic nicotine delivery systems, making them less cool or banning flavors would reduce morbidity and mortality.\nThe FDA is alarmed that, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, \"more than 2 million middle and high school students were current users of e-cigarettes in 2017.\" But that number includes students who reported vaping even once during the previous month. The number of regular users is much smaller, and almost all of them are current or former smokers.\nTo the extent that teenagers who otherwise would be smoking are vaping instead, that is a clear public health gain, since the latter habit is much less dangerous. Despite constant warnings that increased experimentation with e-cigarettes would lead to more smoking, consumption of conventional cigarettes by teenagers continues to decline, reaching a record low last year in the Monitoring the Future Study, which began in 1975.\nIf the FDA sees continued underage vaping as an argument for banning e-cigarettes, the industry is doomed, even though it offers what the agency recognizes as \"an alternative for adult smokers\" who \"seek access to satisfying levels of nicotine, but without all of the harmful effects that come from"}

I was typing out the headline, still not quite sure what I was about to write, when I recognized that the TK was more than a placeholder: it was an idea.\nI\u2019ve realized that there are always more questions I could ask a source, always more information I could research, always more color I can add to make my stories more interesting and engaging. By leaving things open-ended, by creating a space to add something new, even by reminding myself that I really do need to ask someone how old they are, I open up the page to bigger ideas and possibilities.\nI\u2019ve also realized that leaving space in my life for the things to come can open up my own future to bigger ideas and possibilities in a way I didn\u2019t always think was the smartest, most pragmatic move I could make.\nFor a long time, I thought if I left space in my life \u2014 if I filled my planner with TKs instead of meticulously handwritten meetings and appointments \u2014 I would end up feeling empty. I often worried (and still sometimes do) that if I didn\u2019t plan everything out for the next days, weeks, months, and years, those TKs and those spaces I left would turn into nothingness and regrets \u2014 for the opportunities I didn\u2019t seize, the hours I wasted, the time and energy that could have been spent doing something other than daydream, relax, rest in preparation for things to come.\nBut leaving out the TKs just left me with information I didn\u2019t need, my energy overspent in pursuit of what I saw as a very linear path. Packing my schedule in high school, and in my first year and a half in college, seemed like the only way to achieve my goals as a journalist and as a person.\nAnd in some ways, those extracurriculars and activities did help me reach new heights. But the moment I dropped the meetings and classes that overwhelmed me, and the moment I made space for the TKs and all the good things yet to come, I didn\u2019t feel empty, or regretful, or unfulfilled.\nInstead I felt fuller, happier, more fulfilled \u2014 as if my potential increased when I scrapped the jumbo planner and opted for smaller pages and more stickers. The thing I feared \u2014 that I wasn\u2019t doing enough, even though I was doing a lot \u2014 actually dissipated when I started approaching things in anticipation of life\u2019s great TKs. I spent more time with friends, I cooked more, I had the chance to have relax and have fun without worrying that I was wasting time.\nSure, some of the things I wanted to accomplish were no longer carefully plotted, the boxes waiting to be ticked off. Suddenly, there were bigger gaps in my future \u2014 ones that I haven\u2019t yet filled in.

Township supervisor labor in relative obscurity, tackling important, if mundane, issues such as zoning, sidewalk installation, and management of the regional growth boundary.\nFor a career spanning such a long period of time, including so many changes to the area, there have been relatively few speed bumps along the way.
