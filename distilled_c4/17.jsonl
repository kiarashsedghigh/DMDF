It builds on previous work that shows a lack of the protein is strongly tied to the development of eczema.\nResearchers have discovered that a lack of filaggrin could contribute to the onset of eczema.\nResearchers from Newcastle University in the United Kingdom and Stiefel - a GlaxoSmithKline company - report their findings in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\nLead investigator Nick Reynolds, a professor of dermatology at Newcastle University who also works as a skin and eczema specialist in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, says that their discovery \"reinforces the importance of filaggrin deficiency leading to problems with the barrier function in the skin and predisposing someone to eczema.\"\nHe and his colleagues also believe that the study could lead to the development of drugs that target the underlying causes of eczema rather than just alleviate the symptoms.\nEczema is a condition that is usually characterized by dry, itchy, cracked, and rough skin that mainly erupts on the hands, feet, and face, as well as behind the knees and inside the elbows.\nIt can also present with blisters that weep fluid when scratched. The condition can cause disturbed sleep and may profoundly affect quality of life.\nThe most common type of eczema is an inflammatory, non-contagious skin condition called atopic dermatitis that affects around 30 percent of people in the United States, most of them children and adolescents.\nIn this article, the word eczema refers specifically to atopic dermatitis.\nThe exact causes of eczema are unknown. However, research reveals that it is likely to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors and probably involves dysfunction of both the skin barrier and the immune system. People with eczema may also develop asthma and hay fever.\nEczema may worsen or improve over time.\nHowever, for many people, it is a life-long illness.\nPeople with eczema may also be more prone to skin infections.\nIn their study report, the researchers explain that filaggrin plays a key role in maintaining the barrier that protects the skin and that previous research has already established that a lack of the protein strongly predisposes people to eczema.\nHowever, exactly what happens at the molecular level to link filaggrin deficiency to the development of eczema \"remains incompletely understood,\" they note.\nTo further investigate the role of filaggrin, the researchers developed a 3-D model of human skin, in which, using molecular tools, they made the epidermis (the outside layer) deficient in filaggrin.\nThe model closely mimics what happens in the skin of people with eczema.\nUsing the model, the researchers were able to map the proteins and signaling pathways that lie \"downstream\" of filaggrin, and thus observe how the absence of the protein altered them.\nThey identified a number of signaling mechanisms that regulate inflammation, cell structure, stress response, and the function of the skin barrier.\nThe mapping of these pathways in the model appears to match that seen in people with eczema.\nFor example, the skin of people with active eczema has high levels of a protein coded by the gene KLK7.

Mirren, although she is officially a dame commander of the Order of the British Empire, is of working-class origins and is most interested in the way nonfamous women \u2014 working stiffs \u2014 have made strides on film sets.\n\"You have to understand, when I started making movies, I was often the only woman on the set.

Then figure out how much money you can afford to put toward debt payments every month.\nIn any case, you'll continue to pay at least the minimum payment on all debt balances. With the debt snowball method, you'll put any extra money toward your smallest debt until that's paid off, and then you'll tackle the next highest balance. With the debt avalanche, you'll prioritize the highest-interest rate debt first, and so on.\nFor either strategy to be effective, you must continue making at least the minimum payment on all balances. Making late payments or no payments can be damaging to your credit score, as can keeping total balances that take up more than 30% of your credit limit \u2014 known formally as your credit utilization rate.\n\"The avalanche method is typically the most efficient mathematically, but the snowball method might give you the most satisfaction to keep you motivated,\" said Luis Rosa, a CFP who founded the financial-planning firm Build a Better Financial Future.\n\"I'm usually an optimizer, but for those with balances on multiple cards, I love Dave Ramsey's snowball method,\" said Andrew Westlin, a CFP at Betterment. \"Getting that first balance paid off builds confidence and momentum, and these small wins are crucial in long-term success,\" he said.\nMost importantly, find a strategy you can commit to, said Bobbi Rebell, CFP. \"It's like dieting \u2014 there are popular methods that are great, but the best one is the one that works for each person.\""}

And not your standard-issue strum-and-glum guitar rock. The music of the Ezra Reich Band is an unabashed throwback to 1980s synth-pop with big and marvelous hooks that say Berlin, I love you.\nIt's true, said the engaging Ezra, 32, who was delighted to talk about his music and famous dad. \"When I hear 'Take My Breath Away' or some of those huge '80s hits, they sound avant-garde to me, compared to digital recordings now, which sound hard and computer-y. People might be jaded and say those things are cheesy. But I love Roxy Music and the New Romantic new wave bands. You've got great emotional songwriting, simplicity and a really great sound design.\" You can hear the shimmering pop of the Ezra Reich Band on its independent albums \"Freeze the Night\" and \"Milkshake Arcade,\" available on iTunes, and on its newest songs, available on its website.\nSo what inspired Ezra to launch a career in music? The avant-garde sounds of his father? The recordings always playing in the New York apartment where he grew up? Bach? Stravinsky? Berio?\n\"Ritchie Valens,\" Ezra said. When he first heard \"La Bamba\" and \"Donna\" on a 1980s public-radio show called \"Kids America,\" his musical path was sown. No John Cage studies at Juilliard for him. No concerts of electronic blips in Soho art galleries. \"I remember getting in arguments with my dad that I'd wanted to be in a rock band,\" Ezra said. \"He was like, 'I don't know about that.' He had been friends with Phil Lesh and the Grateful Dead coming up, and had been around drugs and all that. But definitely from an early age I was hooked on rock and pop.\"\nWhich isn't to say Ezra wasn't moved by his father's music. \"I was definitely moved by the sounds of my dad, the syncopation of the mallets and the strings. The little rhythms and the interplay of sounds and textures really got to me. I'm a big fan of his early pieces, like 'Music for 18 Musicians,' that have these beautiful harmonies and melodies.\" Ezra added: \"In his heart, my dad's really into harmony and melody and rhythm. So he appreciates great pop songs when they incorporate those things. We've definitely been able to connect on music through the years. And when there's one of my songs that he likes, he really likes it. He'll say 'it made me cry.' He gets so emotional.\"\nLater this year, Ezra and his father will be featured together in a charity project launched by director David Lynch. Currently the David Lynch Foundation offers previously unreleased tracks by an array of artists, including Peter Gabriel, Ben Folds and Maroon 5. Download a compilation album or songs from its website with a pledge. All the money goes to the foundation's program of teaching transcendental meditation to at-risk kids, the homeless and soldiers with PTSD. Ezra and his father will each donate tracks to"}

But infrastructure isn\u2019t the end of the story.\nThere\u2019s another element to this new wave of technology, namely the software ecosystem that will emerge on top of that infrastructure. And a fundamental building block for that will be identity management \u2014 not for the users\u2019 identities, but for the things themselves.\nA company that\u2019s thinking very hard about this element, Evrythng, has just joined a U.K. industry group that was set up last year by mobile chip architecture giant ARM(s armh), white space radio pioneer Neul, next-generation street light firm EnLight, sensor data outfit AquaMW and home energy management company AlertMe. The Internet of Things Architecture Forum (IoTA Forum, not to be confused with a similarly named European Union project) aims to shape the internet of things, and Evrythng\u2019s contribution could make it easier for businesses to plug into that vision.\nHobsbawm drew an analogy between Evrythng\u2019s platform and Facebook(s fb), only a Facebook that\u2019s for inanimate objects rather than people. The idea is to give each item its own discoverable profile that may contain digital content, warranty information, or even an associated virtual object.\n\u201cUsing everything\u2019s system means that if the thing itself doesn\u2019t have embedded connectivity, it\u2019s simply a smart tag, performing many of the same functions. Your Facebook profile is a digital representation of you, an active living thing on the internet \u2014 somebody could be writing on your wall, or a Farmville app could be updating. So when you connect with [an object] using your smartphone, you draw down the updated dynamic state of that information.\nThis could mean neat new applications for consumers, but Evrything also supplies managed analytics and APIs for businesses that want to track individual items and add data to them as they pass through the distribution chain. One example: the firm boasts a case study with the beverages giant Diageo(s deo), where people buying their dad a bottle of whisky for his birthday could add a \u201cpersonalized film tribute\u201d.\nThe company is also working with IBM(s ibm) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and, according to Evrythng, the IoTA Forum is expanding to include device manufacturers and service providers.

{"idx": "17032", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For better or worse, the Bills' immediate future is largely in the hands of their most inexperienced players from today in their home opener and onward.\nManagement is convinced it drafted well and the galling near miss against the Patriots last Monday night provided some evidence that it is more than wishful thinking. None of the draftees had a Rookie-of-the-Year debut, but there was wholesale evidence of helpful contributions.\nThe contributions arrived mostly in bits and pieces, but they came from the team's first six selections in the draft. The Bills would not have borne the look of winners for 58 minutes without them.\nThe most impressive contributions came from the two starting guards, Eric Wood and Andy Levitre. They weren't flawless but they have advanced nicely since being shoved into the lineup in the first preseason game. Levitre is a different player than the freshman who was cleaned and jerked by the Packers' monster defensive lineman, Johnny Jolly, a month ago.\nTight end Shawn Nelson looked like the fourth-round steal many scouts said he was, making a fine play to produce Buffalo's first touchdown of the season. With Terrell Owens and Lee Evans expected to be smothered by multiple coverages for most of the remaining schedule, the tight ends become more essential to the passing game, just as running back Fred Jackson was against the Patriots.\nDefensive end Aaron Maybin, the first-round selection, had a few moments and now more will be expected of him.\nLinebacker Nic Harris made an important, heads-up play on a Buffalo fumble and now his role may be expanded because of middle linebacker Paul Posluszny's broken arm. Jairus Byrd, making the shift from college cornerback to pro safety, made a cameo appearance.\nAnd now there will be roles of increased importance for three virtual rookies, Demetrius Bell, Marcus Buggs and Xavier Omon. Bell continues his baptism under fire as the new offensive left tackle, Buggs replaces Posluszny at middle linebacker and Omon is expected to provide relief for Jackson, who can't be overworked.\nThat seems like a heavy load for what is assuming the identity of a football version of a children's crusade. Bell, for instance, will be facing a defense that has been known for its sophistication in the past. So will Omon in pass-protection situations.\nThose were Monte Kiffin's defenses and he's now at the University of Tennessee, where his son, Lane, is head coach. The Bucs' new defensive coordinator is Jim Bates, who has nearly 40 years of experience. He knows how to make use of veterans such as cornerback Ronde Barber, who long ago made the corner blitz his signature play, and pass rusher Gaines Adams, who may be about to break out.\nIt seems the Bills have made their decision for 2009.

{"idx": "17036", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The United States Navy retired the venerable Grumman F-14 Tomcat in 2006 after more than three decades in service. However, the Tomcat\u2019s demise has left gaps in the carrier air wing that are only now being felt.\nWith the end of the Cold War and declining budgets, the Navy simply could not afford to keep the incredibly maintenance intensive and unreliable Tomcat on the carrier flight deck. Moreover, with the demise of the Soviet threat, the Tomcat\u2019s primary mission of fleet defense has fallen by the wayside and the venerable jet was increasingly used in the strike role. But while the F-14 proved to be a competent strike aircraft, the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet was superior in most respects to the aging Tomcat as a strike fighter in the post-Cold War era. Particularly, the Super Hornet was far more reliable and cost effective\u2014and with its much more modern avionics, it was mostly a more capable aircraft. However, there are still some gaps that the Super Hornet could not fill.\nWhile the Super Hornet with its exceptional Raytheon AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array radar, Harris AN/ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) Block IV system, advanced datalinks and other systems is a potent war machine, the F/A-18E/F has two weaknesses that the Navy has to address for the future which the service divested with the retirement of the Tomcat. Those two factors are range and speed\u2014both of which the Super Hornet falls short on as new threats emerge in Western Pacific and the North Atlantic.\nThe Navy gave up the sheer speed and the range of the Tomcat because the service did not have to contend with the prospect of fending off hordes of Soviet Tupolev Tu-22M Backfire bombers and their cruise missiles in the post-Soviet era. The F-14, of course, was originally the linchpin of the Navy\u2019s Outer Air Battle concept that was designed to prevent a Soviet bomber force from destroying a carrier battle group. While that threat more or less evaporated after 1991, it is starting to reemerge as China rises and Russia reasserts itself on the world stage.\nChina is building a potent air launched anti-ship cruise missiles along with aircraft to carry those weapons. Meanwhile, the once-dormant Russian bomber force is back\u2014though not in the numbers of the Soviet era. Moreover, with the emergence of new adversary stealth aircraft\u2014some of which have the capability to fly very high and very fast\u2014which are also armed with cruise missiles, the Navy will need the range and speed that the Tomcat offered to fend off those threats. The F/A-18E/F can do the job\u2014but only to an extent.\nThus, the successor to the Super Hornet could have capabilities that resemble the F-14 Tomcat in terms of speed and range. However, the similarities will likely end there.

Most of them are beloved. This photo is of one of them that wasn't.\nThat's because it wasn't a tradition born of celebration, like all the best New Orleans traditions tend to be. Rather, it was one born of civic responsibility. Generally begrudging civic responsibility, at that.\nIt happened annually on April 15 as the midnight deadline for filing income taxes with the Internal Revenue Service loomed: Dozens of motorists lined up down Loyola Avenue, waiting to drop off their forms at the U.S. Postal Service's main New Orleans branch. As long as the necessary paperwork was handed off by midnight, it got the coveted April 15 postmark and thus avoided a late-filing penalty.\nTo help facilitate the annual crush of midnight filers, the Loyola post office for years stationed employees at the curb to collect forms so motorists didn't even have to get out of their cars. Many of them hardly even slowed down. For years, local news outlets also dispatched photographers to capture the last-minute rush.\nA similar scene played out at the local IRS office, which offered in-person tax-advice -- and which was also deluged with eleventh-hour filers every April 15.\nNowadays, the magic of e-filing has made the last-minute rush a more private affair. As long as they have an internet connection and tax preparation software, taxpayers can procrastinate from the comfort of their own home. They'll still have to file by the midnight deadline, though.\nEither way, late-filing penalties are the same. According to the folks at TurboTax, late filers will face a 5% penalty of the additional taxes owed for every month they fail to file, up to a maximum of 25%. If a filing is more than 60 days late, the minimum penalty is $205 or 100% of the unpaid tax, whichever is less.\nMike Scott writes about New Orleans history for NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune.

The next biggest increase was seen in whites. Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the suicide rate for women jumped 81.4%; for men it was a 59.5% increase.\nThe three most common suicide methods were firearms, poisoning and suffocation.\nNobody has data yet on why suicides are increasing in this age group, says Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology. \"But the working assumption is that it's related to the economic recession.\"\nThe 2007 recession affected middle-aged males more than any other demographic, he says.

I was puffing on that first run.\"\nDespite the pain of the run, he was hooked by the community of runners.\n\"When you get up in the morning, you have people waiting for you,\" he says. \"You have that support and love that you need. The reason I kept coming out is friendship. Now I meet friends outside the program. It's unconditional friendship and the first community like this I've ever had.\"\nJoseph is now sober and juggling work with classes at San Francisco City College and the school basketball team. He is living in transitional housing and recently completed a half-marathon. He says Back on My Feet is the impetus that got him to turn around his life and the organization has supported him along the way, providing helping with everything from buying books for school to connecting hime with 24 Hour Fitness for a job.\n\"They offer more than exercise,\" says Meghan Freebeck, CEO of San Francisco's Project Homeless Connect, an initiative to address the city's intractable homeless crisis. \"They offer a chance to be a part of a community that empowers one another to reach goals. Today the goal may be small, such as the motivation to go for a run, but tomorrow it might be something greater.\"\nOperating in 12 cities across the U.S., Back on My Feet employs running to give homeless people the confidence, motivation and community to relaunch their lives.\nThe program pulls members from homeless shelters and these folks go on early morning runs of about 1 mile to 3 miles along with a group of volunteers who offer encouragement, support and guidance.\nTo stay in the program, you're required to make three runs a week.\nAfter 30 days, members with 90 percent attendance move into the next phase of the program that provides educational support, job training, classes in financial literacy and employment referrals to hiring partners that include Marriott Hotels, Cigna, Wells Fargo and Cliff Bar.\n\"The running brings structure,\" says CEO Katy Sherratt. \"It gives them a reason to get up in the morning. It shows them they can be accountable and it shows our partners they can be dedicated. If you can get up at 5:30 to do a run, you can get up at 5:30 to go to work.\"\nFor those members who stay committed, the program continues to offer services that address barriers they might face as they rebuild their lives, such as a deposit on a rental or transportation to a job.\nThe program was founded in 2007 by Anne Mahlum whose daily runs through the streets of Philadelphia brought her past a homeless shelter where she always waved hello to"}

In the face of evil, indifference is acquiescence.\nI recently returned from participating in the largest ever Inter-Parliamentary delegation to mark International Remembrance Day at Auschwitz, and to commemorate also the 69th anniversary of the liberation of the most brutal extermination camp of the 20th century.\nFor me, as for my fellow Jewish and non-Jewish parliamentarians, it was a uniquely moving and painful moment \u00ad of bearing witness to horrors too terrible to be believed, but not too terrible to have happened.\nAs I reflect now on my recent visit to the Valley of Death, there are a number of lessons that bear recall and reminder.\nThe first is the importance of zachor, of remembrance of the victims defamed, demonized and dehumanized as prologue and justification for genocide \u00ad and where the mass murder six million Jews, and millions of non-Jews, is not a matter of abstract statistics. As we say at such moments of remembrance, \u201cUnto each person there is a name, each person has an identity, each person is a universe.\u201d We recited the Kaddish at various moments of bearing witness, most painfully upon exiting the barracks containing the crematoria, recalling that \u201cwhoever saves a single life it is as if he or she has saved an entire universe.\u201d Thus, the abiding imperative: we are each, wherever we are, the guarantors of each other\u2019s destiny.\nThe third lesson is the danger of anti-Semitism \u00ad\u2014 the oldest and most enduring of hatreds \u00ad\u2014 and the most lethal. If the Holocaust is a metaphor for radical evil, anti-Semitism is a metaphor for radical hatred. Let there be no mistake about it: Jews died at Auschwitz because of anti-Semitism, but anti-Semitism did not die; and while it begins with Jews, it doesn\u2019t end with Jews.\nThe fourth painful and poignant lesson is that these Holocaust crimes resulted not only from state-sanctioned incitement to hatred and genocide, but from crimes of indifference, from conspiracies of silence \u00ad from the international community as bystander.\nAs it happens, this International Holocaust Remembrance Day occurred on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, when from April to July 1994, close to one million Rwandans were murdered. What makes the Rwandan genocide so unspeakable is not only the horror of the genocide itself, but that this genocide was preventable.\nNo one can say that we did not know; we knew, but we did not act.\nToday, we know but have yet to act to stop the slaughter of civilians in Syria, ignoring the lessons of history and mocking the Responsibility to Protect doctrine.\nLet there be no mistake about it: Indifference and inaction always mean coming down on the side of the victimizer, never the victim.

The purpose is to assist a person in achieving and maintaining his/her best physical, emotional, vocational, and social potential.\nAt a first appointment, you will be given forms to fill out to assess your current status and they will be kept as part of your permanent record; if you need help in filling them out, there are people there to assist you.\nYou may benefit from the programs at the centre if you have any of the following medical conditions \u2014 post myocardial infarction (heart attack), post angioplasty, post coronary bypass or heart valve surgery, acute coronary syndrome, chronic lung conditions such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis or post lung transplant surgery.\nThese programs are an initiative of the Nova Scotia Health Authority. They are also made available at the Inverness Consolidated Hospital for 12 weeks and also in Baddeck for 10 weeks.\nThe rehabilitation programs include education, nutrition counselling, exercise, support and risk factor reduction strategies in scheduled sessions over a three-month period.\nActivities take place in individual and group sessions.\nThe exercise classes are one-hour long and held twice weekly. This class includes a group warm-up which includes light to moderate exercises done at your own pace. After the warm-up, you participate in an aerobic or training phase consisting of walking and cycling. Finally, a group cool-down consisting of stretches and relaxation exercises is done prior to the end of class.\nIt is essential that the warm-up and cool-down are not missed as they are the most important part of a safe exercise program.\nDuring each class you will be recording several measurements in your workbook: your weight, your heart rate at different times in the class, your blood pressure, your rate of the degree of effort of the exercise and any symptoms you have experienced. If you have any problems or symptoms during or after exercise class, the staff will assist you.\nYou have an exercise stress test prior to attending either the cardiac or pulmonary rehab programs. This can be arranged through the centre or through your family practitioner.\nWhat are the benefits? Well, participating in these programs may decrease your shortness of breath, improve fitness, decrease your cholesterol levels, control/decrease blood pressure, control/decre"}

Sadly, far too few colleges and universities offer a degree in financial planning. But students who do graduate and take the certified financial planner (CFP) exam can easily start earning $50,000 a year or more.\nThat point was well-made at the Financial Planning Association national conference held in Chicago recently. Teams of students competed to win the Student Challenge, a three-round effort that entailed creating a written financial plan, presenting a case study before some tough judges and a game show challenge along the lines of \"Jeopardy\" with multiple choice answers.\nThese young experts answered questions in categories ranging from principles of financial planning to estate planning, as well as investments, tax and insurance. For example: For $400 in the investment category, which of these four answers properly defines \"beta\"? Or for $200 in the insurance category, which of these answers describes the tax status of the beneficiary of a life insurance policy?\nDirectors of these college level programs traveled to the competition with their student teams, beaming with pride as they competed. John Grable of the University of Georgia reported that his program has 150 undergrads studying financial planning, along with 70 working toward a master's degree and another 30 students getting a PhD in financial planning.\nAll of them go on to great jobs with financial planning firms, he explained. And Professor Grable made special note that almost none of these students go on to work for broker/dealer firms (notorious for selling commissioned products) or for life insurance companies. This new generation truly takes the term \"fiduciary\" to heart, eschewing careers built on sales pitches and determined to serve middle-income families.\nOnce the student graduates, he or she can immediately sit for the CFP exam. The degree is conferred only after at least two years of experience, typically accomplished with internships while in school combined with a post-grad job with a CFP financial planning firm.\nSurprisingly, most of these college programs in financial planning do not come at the major universities. Utah Valley in Orem, Utah, has one of the largest programs with more than 400 students. The fast-growing and highly regarded Texas A&M program created by Dr. Nathan Harness started just a few years ago. Its students were among the top competitors.\nYou can get a list of colleges offering financial planning programs at www.cfp.net.\nDr. Harness notes that these degree programs will revolutionize the concept of financial planning as a profession. Most professions, he points out, start with a generalized education and then develop specialties. For example, physicians get an M.D. degree before going on to specialize. But traditionally financial planners have come from a \"branch\" of financial the financial world -- starting out in insurance or investments, for example. It's as if, he says, \"a tree grew backwards, starting with the branches!\"\nSince all certified financial planners must pass an excruciating test that covers all aspects of financial planning, this new generation of planners will have a much broader knowledge base. And starting in October 2019, all CFPs must operate as fiduciaries -- that is, follow the standard that puts clients' interests ahead of their own and fully disclosing all fees, commissions and other rewards for giving specific investment and product advice. That will truly be a mark of distinction.\nTo learn more about financial planning as a career, or to search for CFPs in your area, go to www.CFP.net.

And some of his top appointments \u2014 including his pick for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his selection for secretary of state, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson \u2014 have longstanding ties to Russia and personal relationships with Putin himself.\nThe change in views has been swift.\nBack in July 2014 just 10 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, according to a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov. By September of 2016, that number rose to 24 percent. And it's even higher today: 37 percent of Republicans view Putin favorably, the poll found in December.\nWhile the Russian president still has a net un-favorability rating among Republicans, his standing has improved dramatically \u2013 from a net negative of 66 points to a mere 10 points.\nBy comparison, only 17 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of President Barack Obama, the December poll found. Obama\u2019s net negative among Republicans is 64 points \u2013 significantly worse than the party\u2019s take on Putin.\nWithin the GOP there has always been a faction with more sympathetic views toward Putin and Russia. Republicans like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher have taken a more open-minded view of Putin\u2019s behavior in places like Crimea and Syria. But for years Rohrbacher and others like him were pariahs who existed outside the mainstream.\nFor the GOP, it\u2019s been a sudden shift from a hardline on Russia, toward something resembling respect, if not warmth.\nDaniel Vajdich, a former foreign policy adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, recalled traveling to Foreign Relations Chair Sen. Bob Corker\u2019s home state of Tennessee just after Russia annexed Crimea and supported rebel incursions in Eastern Ukraine.\nFor the Corker constituents Vadjich met, \u201cno other issue\u2014not Iraq, Syria or Iran\u2014 topped the emotion or frustration about what the Russians were doing in Ukraine and the way the Obama Administration was failing to do anything about it,\u201d he said.\nNow, the Republican president-elect Trump has said he would consider recognizing Crimea as part of Russia.\nThere also may be some politics at play, said said Larry Sabato director of the center for politics at the University of Virginia, because Putin\u2019s alleged involvement boosted the GOP. Among the alleged Russian incursions into the election were hackers obtaining and leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\nTrump, for his part, continues to contest that there was any Russian involvement in the election-related hackings.\n\u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?

There were laughs and tears from the audience as Jimmy answered her questions with brutal honesty.\nThen there was the music - not from Jimmy but some songs from his childhood and the memories behind them. Artists such as Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, Dusty Springfield, Ray Charles and Deep Purple have all been big influences on his career.\nJimmy's books Working Class Boy and Working Class Man tell of his humble beginnings in the mean streets of Glasgow through to his life as an Aussie rock star desperate to escape his demons.

But now it won't include the mayor herself.\nMayor Jackie Biskupski on Monday \u2014 just weeks after she announced her bid for re-election \u2014 withdrew from the race, citing a \"private\" and \"serious and complex family situation,\" as well as duties to her office in the remaining nine months of her term.\n\"My commitment to my family and my role as mayor must be my top priorities over being a candidate,\" Biskupski said Monday.\nBiskupski and her wife, Betty Iverson, held hands when they appeared for a news conference outside the mayor's office. Biskupski, at times choking back tears, said the decision was \"hard for me\" and \"very emotional.\"\nBiskupski did not offer details on the situation facing her family but said, \"Recently my wife Betty and I have been faced with a serious and complex family situation that requires our attention.\"\n\"As parents, we have and will always put the needs of our children first,\" Biskupski said. \"With that as our compass, we have made a decision for our family which will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. As this is a private issue involving our children, that is all I want to say on the matter and I appreciate your respect of our privacy.\n\"For this reason, I have come to the difficult decision to withdraw from the 2019 Salt Lake City mayor\u2019s race,\" she said.\nPublic court records show Iverson is involved in a child custody dispute. Biskupski did not respond to an inquiry asking whether the case had anything to do with her decision not to run. Her spokesman, Matthew Rojas, told the Deseret News that the mayor would not say anything further regarding her decision as it relates to her family.\nBiskupski made national headlines when she won election in 2015, becoming Salt Lake City's first openly gay mayor. She ran on a platform of change and as a champion for social justice. As she prepared to take office, Biskupski got engaged to and later married Iverson, and they joined their families. Biskupski's adoptive son, Archie, and Iverson's adoptive son, Jack, became brothers.\nBiskupski said she hopes she's remembered for creating \"big shifts so there was more equity for opportunity,\" whether that's through the overhaul of homeless services, more affordable housing, or better transportation options.\nAsked if she would consider another run for office in the future, Biskupski said, \"No, this is long term.\"\n\"At the end of the day, this is where I wanted to end my political career,\" she said. \"For me, after this, it's about being a mother to my kids.\"\nBiskuspki's surprise announcement comes after a hectic first term for the mayor, who felt the brunt of backlash from several controversies \u2014 at times clashing with the Salt Lake City Council and other county and state leaders.\nThose included the siting of the homeless resource centers at the end of her first year in office; standoffs with state leaders, including former House Speaker Greg Hughes, over shutting down Rio Grande Street to clean up the area around the downtown homeless shelter; and most recently, an ongoing battle with Gov.

In New York, an effort to hold present-day Germany responsible for what is grimly called the first genocide of the 20th century hit a setback.\nThe case was brought by indigenous Ovaherero and Nama and descendants of the estimated 100,000 people who were systematically killed by colonizing Germans between 1904 and 1908 in what is now Namibia.\nRuben Carranza, senior expert on reparations for the International Center for Transitional Justice, noted that U.S. courts have become a resource for survivors of dictatorships, war criminals and genocides.\n\u201cVictims can of course file cases in their own countries\u2019 courts \u2013 but those courts cannot reach assets in the U.S. or elsewhere and will not have the kind of political impact that a judgment in a country in which judges have a relative degree of independence and enforcement power can exercise,\u201d Carranza said in an email.\nIn the United States, however, such cases face a high bar. After U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain threw out Ovaherero and Nama\u2019s suit earlier this month for lack of jurisdiction, attorney Ken McCallion appealed immediately, confident that the Second Circuit will give his clients a reversal.\nNamibia is identified as Cota Caffares in this 1707 map of southern Africa by Johann Baptist Homann, part of the collection at the James Ford Bell Library.\nLead plaintiff Veraa Katuuo said that he and fellow litigants always knew they were in for a long haul.\n\u201cThis is a unique and historical case, and through this process we succeeded to educate the world about the Ovaherero and Nama genocide at the hands of German soldiers, and in the process put brakes on the so-called government-to-government genocide and reparation negotiations,\u201d said Katuuo, who founded the Association of the Ovaherero Genocide in the USA.\n\u201cWe are going to take advantage of every avenue available to us within the United States judicial system, and hold \u2018mighty\u2019 Germany accountable for the crimes they have committed against the Nama and Ovaherero peoples,\u201d Katuuo added in an email.\nSeveral experts contacted about the case called it important for German society and government to do right by the Ovaherero and Nama, particularly given how the West has grappled for decades with fallout from the Holocaust. The latest version of Katuuo\u2019s complaint calls Germany\u2019s annihilation efforts in southwest Africa a \u201cprecursor\u201d to the events of World War II less than four decades later.\nCarranza suggested a multipronged effort for reparations.\nWilliam Darity Jr., an economist and professor of public policy at Duke University, also said German citizens should pressure their government to pass legislation for Ovaherero and Nama reparations.\n\u201cTrying to do this through the U.S. court system evades the question of who has direct responsibility and obligation for the compensation,\u201d Darity said in an interview, wryly noting this same court system has a history of shooting down cases for domestic slavery reparations.\nThe presence of the well-established Ovaherero and Nama people, already sovereign nations on the territory, meant the German settlers had to rent land and sign treaties.

I expected, at the very least, a grovelling apology from Tony Blair. I had been looking forward to this for months.\nInstead, I have had to stomach the gloating and moralising of Blair, Hoon and Alastair Campbell as the establishment of this godforsaken country closes ranks to protect itself, its intelligence services and the oh so wonderful MoD.\nLord Hutton's damning report of the BBC is a whitewash. The result will create fear at the Today programme, where there should be pride. As so many times before, they were there with a story that nobody else would touch. And I still cannot see why Gavyn Davies and Greg Dyke have had to resign. It flies in the face of reality, ripping all evidence to shreds.\nThis is a theatre of the absurd. It has left everybody I know shaking their heads in disbelief and anger. Such a performance should make us all deeply nervous about the future of Britain. While Blair wishes to draw a line under the whole episode, I hope this doesn't happen. Sometimes a story will end up being told, no matter how many times they try to close the book.\nI am staring at a photo of Campbell at the foot of some grand stairs, mewing and preaching about truth. An unelected, unanswerable force who was willing to destroy the integrity of others and make their lives unbearable to save his skin and that of his masters.\nAs Andrew Gilligan submitted to Hutton, why was the BBC singled out when other media reports questioned the intelligence as well? Why did Campbell suddenly give disproportionate attention to the Today programme's story, after weeks of hoping it would go away?\nCampbell needed to deflect attention from an issue that stood to bring down the government. He had been told to construct a truth that would justify a \"pre-emptive\" war against international law, while voices in the wings were whispering \"lies\". His response was unforgivable. He deliberately went on the offensive, choosing his favourite soft target, one that had dared to go beyond the embedded reporting of the war to show it in a less than flattering light.\nCampbell himself chose to become the story, using his indignation at such a slur on the government's \"integrity\", and so avoiding the substance of the accusation itself.\nHe now claims the BBC, from the top down, did not tell the truth. In what way? It didn't check out the story? It seems, sir, your little story about WMD didn't check out either. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him after this sustained attack on his integrity? Nobody cares about his integrity; they just want to know why we went to war against international law on weak single-source intelligence.\nAnd are we supposed to feel sorry for Blair? He has made a very dangerous political mistake which endangers global stability and has sent thousands to their deaths. He tells us that he will be judged by his maker. Well, he certainly wasn't judged by Hutton, was he?\nIt was entirely in the public interest to question the construction of this intelligence report, even if done rather shakily at 6.07am.

On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry stated that President Assad should be included in any negotiations to facilitate a political transition in Syria.\nLet\u2019s have a look at what he had to say.\nJOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We are working very hard with other interested parties to see if we can reignite a diplomatic outcome. Why? Because everybody agrees there is no military solution. There is only a political solution.\nBut to get the Assad regime to negotiate, we\u2019re going to have to make it clear to him that there is a determination by everybody to seek that political outcome and change his calculation about negotiating. That\u2019s underway right now.

President Assad replied, the Syrian people will decide what political transition takes place in Syria.\nNow joining us to discuss all of this and the significance of these two statements is Larry Wilkerson. Larry is a former chief of staff for the U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and currently an adjunct professor of government at the College of William & Mary and a regular contributor to The Real News Network.\nAs always, thanks for joining us, Larry.\nPERIES: Now, Larry, this is an opening step forward. The U.S. until now has maintained the position of regime change in Syria. What brought about this shift?\nWILKERSON: A recognition of reality, as far as I\u2019m concerned. President Obama made a mistake when the Syrian Civil War commenced, probably advised by Samantha Power and Susan Rice, that it was a similar episode to what had happened in Egypt, templating Egypt onto Syria. Of course, it wasn\u2019t. This is a common mistake by the United States, thinking that all Arab countries are the same, or for that matter, all other countries, period, are the same. They are not. In this case they are decidedly not. Basher al-Assad has significant power sources in Syria. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere other than dying of whatever causes. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go anywhere for the near future. So the United States is coming late to this recognition of reality that Bashar al-Assad is the elected, if you will, leader of Syria and he is going to stay in that position, and we need to deal with it.\nPERIES: Now, clearly the Iranian delegation to Damascus to speak with President Assad signifies that they\u2019re in conversation. Is this being communicated obviously to Washington in some way to have Secretary of State Kerry take a shift in his position?\nWILKERSON: I hope we\u2019ve been having conversations with Assad\u2019s people on the side, so to speak. For some time now\u2013and I hope that this retort by Assad, which basically is correct\u2013I mean, I would say nothing less than he said, the Syrian people will determine who\u2019s going to be their leader.

The cool air is back, bringing with it the promise of jumper season and we\u2019re excited. Reason being, there\u2019s just nothing better than snuggling up in a cosy woolly sweater when autumn starts closing in.\nSo here to help stop you from ever having to take off your snug attire of choice, we\u2019ve joined up with H&M and their new autumn menswear collection (in stores now) to bring you a handful of clever ways to wear your beloved jumper collection to literally any occasion.\nOf all of the items on the list, dressing for a party is (probably) the chillest of all.\nBut the most important thing to remember when dressing for more casual occasions is ensuring that your casual wear still looks clean and well-presented, otherwise, you run the risk of looking like a bit of a dag.\nSwap out your tired bobbly jersey for a fre$h, slouchy knit (see above) and a pair of chinos. Then inject some cool by mixing in more casual accessories like bold sneaks.\nFirst dates are effectively job interviews for your love life. Granted, that\u2019s not a very romantic way of looking at dates, but it\u2019s true. Just like when you meet your prospective co-worker, you want your first impression with your hot date to be impressive, rather than underwhelming.\nIdeally, you want to strike that perfect balance between looking clean and presentable, but also relaxed and casual. This means wearing something that you feel comfortable in \u2013 cue: the crew neck jumper \u2013 preferably in an earthy, statement hue (see above), finished with a casual jacket shrugged over the top and matching pants.\nWhen picking an outfit for the meeting the \u2018rents milestone, it\u2019s very much a case of \u2018know your audience\u2019.\nFor example, you might want your partner\u2019s mates to see you like a nice, cool dude, but their parents probably don\u2019t give a crap if you look \u2018cool\u2019, they just want you to look sensible and trustworthy.\nUse this as a gauge for picking your outfit, opting for more classic, timeless pieces, like this zip-down V-neck style (see above) worn with printed trousers and a smarter coat.\nTo shop the tight edit, head into your nearest H&M store today."}

The first time around, Lauzon destroyed Gabe Ruediger in just over two minutes to win his fight and take home \u2018Submission of the Night\u2019 honors to boot.\nThe second go round for Lauzon didn\u2019t go nearly as well as he found himself on the bad end of a one-sided beating courtesy of Michael Johnson. Despite being a heavy favorite going into the night, Lauzon struggled at every turn facing Johnson and when it was over he lost a lopsided unanimous decision.\nIt was the only fight I can ever think of that I would say I was embarrassed about\u2026that last fight was crap.\nIt was like a nightmare come true for Lauzon fighting in front of his friends, family and students as the entire town of Boston seemed to show up and support him.\nLooking back now, Lauzon makes no excuses for what happened but it really was a case of everything that could go wrong, did go wrong and it ended up being one of the most miserable nights of his nearly decade long career.\n\"Michael Johnson fought a great fight. I think I peaked a little bit too early. It was weird fighting in Boston because I usually go through a certain routine like flying out, check into the hotel, establishing a workout schedule but being at home it just didn\u2019t seem quite real. It was kind of like it was my last week of training instead of the week of the fight. The big thing was Michael Johnson happened,\" Lauzon told FOX Sports on Wednesday. \"He snapped to, and I felt bad warming up and he hit me with a big shot and he kept getting faster and I kept getting slower and the margin increased quite a bit. It was just tough.\"\nLauzon has faced defeat before in other fights and losing is just part of what goes along with competition. Nobody wins all the time, but this one was particularly hard to swallow because of all the other attention that came along with Lauzon fighting in front of his hometown and then falling in a manner that he describes as embarrassing.\nAs Lauzon approaches his next fight at UFC on FOX 9 against Mac Danzig, he\u2019s keeping the bout against Johnson tucked away as a friendly reminder of how a fight can go so utterly wrong all at once. He knows there\u2019s no going back and getting a \u2018do over\u2019 for that performance, so the best way to erase the memory of a bad fight is to go out and create a new vision for everyone to remember instead.\n\"It was definitely motivation.

So I want to put a stamp on this next fight, put an exclamation point on it and let people know that I\u2019m here and let them see what they normally get out of me.

It\u2019s like a voice calling out thousands of miles away,\u201d Algaze explained.\nThe Egyptian mummy that Jane Stanford had bought in 1901 used to be housed at the Stanford Museum, yet just five years later, in 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake caused great damage to the case of the mummy, shattering the coffin\u2019s cartonnage into many pieces that were distributed into multiple boxes and then left untouched for decades.\nAlgaze explained that she had a premonition that there was something of great worth hidden inside these boxes and trusted the feeling she had.\nUpon examining the many fragments of the case of the Egyptian mummy, she chanced upon two that had been delicately inscribed. To help her translate these texts, the student invited Foy Scalf from the University of Chicago and Barbara Richter from the University of California, Berkeley to help her understand these ancient texts.\nThe location where the mummy had originally been placed is in a city in Egypt that is now called Akhmim. The case itself was found to have been constructed during the Greco-Roman period with an approximate date that runs from 100 BCE to 100 CE. However, the inscription placed on the Egyptian tomb shows that it was written during the Roman era, in around 30 BCE.\n\u201cThere are so few inscriptions from that era of Egypt that the experts I contacted were really excited and eager to take a look and help me out,\u201d Algaze noted.\nChristina Hodge, who is a curator at the Stanford University Archaeology Collections, was very enthusiastic about the new discovery and was surprised that no documentation existed for the writing on this Egyptian mummy case.\nHodge also noted that it was a very happy coincidence that the writing on the case managed to survive the 1906 earthquake, and that it was fortunately on one of the larger pieces of cartonnage.\nAriela Algaze is just happy that she has learned more about the woman who was mummified inside the coffin as this is a way of keeping her legacy alive.\nWith the incredible discovery of writing on the case of this Egyptian mummy\u2019s tomb, there is always the possibility that further inscriptions will be uncovered when all of the fragments of cartonnage in the boxes have been analyzed."}
{"idx": "17090", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Since the late 1990s, school boards across the United States have been asked repeatedly to delay predawn school start times and bus schedules, and some\u2014including schools in Decatur, Ga., and Amherst, Mass.\u2014appear poised to move in that direction. Just last month, the Fairfax County, Va., school board set a goal of starting its high schools no earlier than 8 a.m. to promote student sleep and health.\nThese recent developments, while encouraging, are baby steps on a road marked by considerable idling and even reversals. They join a plethora of both new and decades-old campaigns, including ones championed by a Florida pediatrician; a Wisconsin research librarian; district superintendents in Louisiana and Massachusetts; students in California, New Hampshire, and Missouri; and parents in Washington state and my own state of Maryland.\nMost of these efforts fail, primarily for systemic reasons. The science is there; the will to change is not. Today you'd be hard-pressed to find a health professional, sleep scientist, or educator who would defend starting high schools in the 7 a.m. hour, now the norm for many U.S. high schools, as good for physical or mental health, safety, or learning. But politics and human nature typically keep schools from prioritizing student health and well-being when they draw up the academic schedule.\nGiven the science, the idea of starting high schools later is a no-brainer. Waking before sunrise means teens must be asleep by about 8:30 p.m. to get the approximately nine hours of sleep per night their growing brains and bodies require. Even disregarding homework, extracurriculars, and electronics, physiologic changes mean most adolescents can't fall asleep before 11 p.m. Shifted circadian rhythms make 7 a.m. in teens (and younger teachers) equivalent to 4 a.m. in their parents.\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's, or CDC's, 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey estimated that 70 percent of U.S. teens are sleep-deprived, with nearly 40 percent getting six or fewer hours of sleep per night\u2014setting them up for a sobering litany of health and learning problems.\nSafety is an issue, too. With bus runs starting in the 5 a.m. hour, students wait in the pitch black, often with no sidewalks or even shoulders of the road, or they drive themselves drowsily to school. Because these early-start school days end around 2 p.m., teenagers come home to hours of unsupervised time, which, together with sleep deprivation, predisposes them to risk-taking and delinquent behavior.\nMany state and local medical societies have advocated later start times in the past two decades. CDC researchers have confirmed that delaying school start times is a demonstrated strategy to promote sufficient sleep among adolescents. A Harvard School of Public Health forum on America's sleep deficit, held in March, emphasized the need to start schools later, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is developing a policy statement about safe and healthy start times for middle and high schools.\nAligning start times with student body clocks decreases dropout rates, truancy, moodiness, car crashes, depression, and related medication needs, and it improves school performance and increases the amount of sleep students get per night. Brookings Institution economists recently showed that early school start times reduce performance among disadvantaged students by an amount equivalent to having"}

It is simply shot with a simple message and there is nothing to buy.\nThe Power of Love was originally a 1984 chart topping hit by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, whose band members also wrote the song. In 2012 Gabrielle Aplin\u2019s recording of the song also went to number 1 in the UK.\nAs the ad ends, the baby Jesus does something that has never been done before in any ad. He giggles.\nThe ad was produced by the award-winning digital agency, Contra. It took 7 hours to film, involved 12 set changes and several days of computer rendering to give it the final cinematic feel.\nThe Christmas Starts with Christ viral ad cost \u00a310,000 to make and was funded by donations to the campaign.\nThe Christmas Starts with Christ Campaign is in its sixth year. The campaign has the single aim of maintaining Christmas as a Christian festival. It provides a range of worship resources together with promotional and publicity materials. This year will also see radio and poster ads appearing from 14th December onwards and the campaign has partnered with Hope to help promote the Silent Night Carols events.\nThe campaign team consists of representatives from a wide range of major Christian organisations and denominations, together with professionals from media, marketing and advertising."}

In an attempt to woo younger voters, she said low-earning graduates would benefit from a delay in their student loan repayments. She also vowed to freeze fee levels.\nThe Conservative party are keen to attract young voters because, after the last election, it was clear that we were drawn to Labour. So Theresa May is considering making the bracket [for earnings when you have to start paying your loan back] \u00a325,000 as opposed to \u00a321,000. This is of no interest to me whatsoever because the Tories lie and have done consistently. There is no reason for me to trust them.

I get frustrated because I am paying so much money but don\u2019t always get much back, especially when you do an arts degree. Fees are so high and if you compare it to countries where university is free, it should be the case here. Education should be accessible. The Conservatives could not do anything that would change my mind and make me vote for them. They are a horrible party for breeding fake values.\nI don\u2019t think you should have to pay for education and \u00a39,000 [for tuition fees] is so much. If the Conservatives did something to make it cheaper then that would be good but there are some places in the world where it is free. I voted for Jeremy Corbyn at the last election because he sounds like he is more for us, and more for people really. Theresa May doesn\u2019t seem to care. If she wants to change people\u2019s opinions she should be more like Corbyn and make everything more suited for upcoming generations.\nThey say they will cap tuition fees but politicians have said stuff like that before and they\u2019ve still gone up. I don\u2019t believe anything is going to change. I don\u2019t agree with getting rid of tuition fees completely because people on minimum wage would have to pay for people to go to top universities and then earn really good salaries. I do agree that they should be reduced in some way though. I support Labour at the moment. I don\u2019t agree with the fundamental principles of the Tory government, so I don\u2019t think I would ever support them.\nTheresa May has more work to do to win over young voters. Corbyn gave us much more reason to see him as a good leader. She has now realised the error she made and is going back on herself, but she has more to do in my mind. It\u2019s a step in the right direction but it is one thing to make a promise and another to follow it through and execute it. We will see, but if she pulls it out of the bag then I would be really happy \u2013 everyone would be.\nThe new announcement doesn\u2019t really make much difference.

This allowed the surgeons to reconstruct his large skull defect using a combination of metal and acrylic commonly referred to as a cranioplasty.\nThis unprecedented surgery was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and was led by Chad R. Gordon, D.O., now assistant professor in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and former MGH associate staff member and craniomaxillofacial fellow at Harvard Medical School. The patient, a middle-aged male, had undergone surgery to remove a brain tumor by neurosurgery, which was subsequently complicated by a severe bone infection requiring partial removal of his skull bone. This left him with a significant skull deformity and helmet therapy was prescribed daily in an attempt to protect his exposed brain from further injury. During the prolonged time required to clear the bone infection, his brain had expanded outside the limits of his native skull, therefore making any type of standard skull reconstruction impossible.\nGordon and his colleagues decided to use a new approach they now refer to as a \u201cbipolar duraplasty\u201d to temporarily treat this patient\u2019s herniation. Using this maneuver, plastic surgeons employed low-level heat in a careful, precise manner to strategically shrink the brain instantaneously, thereby allowing them the opportunity to perform the planned cranioplasty. In this instance, metal and plastic are used in combination to replace the missing skull in its previous position. This provides permanent brain protection and, at the same time, restores an optimal aesthetic appearance. Bipolar cautery, as used here, is the first-ever reported case worldwide of craniofacial surgeons using bipolar electrocautery to temporarily reshape the brain.\nThe patient was monitored closely for a year following his surgery and reported no complication. Gordon says he hopes to conduct a future clinical trial that will evaluate long-term outcomes in similar cranioplasty patients.\nA video highlighting the Bipolar Duraplasty procedure can be viewed here: http://mfile.akamai.com/21490/wmv/digitalwbc.download.akamai.com/21492/wm.digitalsource-na-regional/jns11-744_video_source_video_1.asx (Media Player required).

We\u2019re the only developed country to have this problem. But there are some solutions.\nSo it makes perfect sense for Massachusetts to have a law that requires gun permit applicants to complete a four-hour safety course, provide character references from two people, consent to be fingerprinted at a local police office and undergo an interview with an officer. If police believe the applicant is a threat, they can deny the permit \u2014 though the burden of proof is on the authorities to justify that decision.\nSo is the Massachusetts law actually working? Well, the state\u2019s gun fatality rate was the lowest in the U.S. in 2016, adjusted for age and population.\nMeanwhile, other new laws are designed to remove guns from individuals who can clearly be identified as posing a threat to themselves or others.\nIndeed, a new Florida law recently took center stage when an Orlando student who had spoken openly online about committing a school shooting was temporarily barred from owning any weapons or ammunition. The student had referred to a gunman who killed nearly 60 people during a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October as \u201cmy hero.\u201d Police interviewed the student, and the youth revealed plans to commit a school shooting \u2014 most likely at the middle school where he was being bullied.\nThanks to the new law, that didn\u2019t happen.\nThe state law was passed after February\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. It\u2019s called a \u201crisk protection order\u201d \u2014 a kind of civil injunction \u2014 and it also gave police the power to remove a firearm owned by the Orlando student\u2019s father.\nIf this law had been in place when the Parkland shooter legally purchased an AR-15, it presumably would have flagged the long-troubled youth as a risk and promptly prevented him from buying the weapon. In fact, the law has worked to keep the shooter\u2019s brother from purchasing, possessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition for 12 months. He had shown a pattern of violent behavior in recent years and was flagged by the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nIt\u2019s been said that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun. But what about that gray area: the person who has displayed unsettling signs of potentially becoming a bad guy \u2014 and who now has a desire to buy a firearm? Shouldn\u2019t we be able to stop him before he totally regresses to the point where he\u2019s an obviously bad guy firing away in a school?\nThis temporary injunction, complete with an appeal process, is a common-sense way to protect both society and individual rights."}

By that time, he and Engels had placed utopian socialist aspirations on a scientific foundation and laid the basis for a revolutionary political movement of the international working class. Between 1843 and 1847, Marx carried out a revolution in theoretical thought that overcame both the limitations of the predominantly mechanical materialism of the eighteenth century and the idealist mystifications of Hegel\u2019s dialectical logic.\n4. Had Marx laid down his pen following the writing of The Communist Manifesto, his place in history would still have been assured. But what elevated him to the stature of a world historical figure was the writing of Das Kapital, which substantiated the materialist conception of history. In the 150 years that have passed since the publication of its first volume in 1867, several generations of bourgeois economists have devoted their professional lives to refuting Marx\u2019s work. In vain! Their efforts are confounded not only by the force of Marx\u2019s dialectical methodology and historical insight, but also, and even more, by the reality of capitalist crisis. However much the professors may protest, the capitalist world \u201cmoves\u201d as Marx explained. Each assault on Das Kapital is invariably followed by a new practical demonstration of the insoluble economic and social contradictions of the capitalist system.\n5. The last such lesson, which continues to this day, began with the global crash of 2008. The essential categories and concepts of Marxian political economy\u2014such as labor power, constant and variable capital, surplus value, the declining rate of profit, exploitation, the fetishism of commodities, the industrial reserve army, and the relative and absolute impoverishment of the proletariat\u2014are required not only for a scientific understanding of capitalism, but even for a basic understanding of daily political, economic and social developments.\n6. One can be certain that the bicentenary of Marx\u2019s birth will be marked by numerous academic seminars in which professors will poke around at Marx\u2019s theories. Many of them will focus on what they claim to be his errors or omissions. There will be some, a small minority, who will praise Marx\u2019s work. But the truest and most objective appraisal of Marx\u2019s life will take place outside the classrooms.\n7. This new year of 2018\u2014the bicentenary of Marx\u2019s birth\u2014will be characterized, above all, by an immense intensification of social tensions and an escalation of class conflict around the world. For several decades, and especially since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the resistance of the working class to capitalist exploitation has been suppressed. But the essential contradictions of the capitalist system\u2014between a globally interdependent economy and the archaic bourgeois nation-state system; between a worldwide network of social production, involving the labor of billions of human beings, and private ownership of the means of production; and between the essential needs of mass society and the selfish interests of individual capitalist money-making\u2014are now rapidly approaching the point where the further suppression of mass working class opposition to capitalism is impossible.\n8. The level of wealth concentration in a small layer of the population has reached historically unprecedented levels. This is a global process. The world\u2019s richest one percent owns half the world\u2019s wealth.  The richest 500 individuals have, as of December 2017, a combined wealth of $"}

That will be followed by an engagement of the play on Broadway, where it is to open March 6.\n\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\" a scathing attack on corporate America based on the 1952 best-selling novel by Shepherd Mead, finds Broderick cast as J. Pierrepont Finch, an unctuous young man who approaches brown-nosing as an art form. The musical, with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, opened on Broadway in 1961 and made a star of Robert Morse, who also starred in David Swift's 1967 movie of the play.\nThe part demands a lot of Broderick, who is called upon to sing and dance onstage for the first time as he portrays a character who could easily come off as repulsive if not given the proper shading.\nThe fact that he has a daunting year of work stretching ahead of him may account in part for Broderick's subdued demeanor at today's rehearsal. This isn't to say that Broderick isn't up to the job; when director Des McAnuff gives the signal and the cast springs into action, Broderick lights up like a Christmas tree.\nHe is, however, clearly a man who knows not to squander his energy, to speak softly, pay attention and give what is asked of him with as much precision as possible. He is, in short, a team player, and the team he's working with here seems quite fond of him.\n\"Matthew is a total delight, and I'm having a great time with him,\" says McAnuff, a director known for his ability to breathe new life into threadbare material. \"I felt no trepidation at all about his ability to carry a musical, either, because he has a beautiful singing"}

Montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate, since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people\u2019s lives at risk. If Lubitz\u2019s doctor did not alert Germanwings, it must have been because Lubitz did not seem like a threat.\nThere are two arguments for why Lubitz\u2019s doctor did the right thing by not disclosing Lubitz\u2019s depression to his employer. First, functional doctor-patient relationships depend on trust. If confidentiality between patients and doctors is breached, patients will no longer trust their doctors. And a lack of trust will lead (at least some) patients to hide some of their symptoms or refrain from seeking medical attention altogether for fear of bad consequences, such as stigmatisation and work-related penalties.\nMore dangerous than a pilot with a mental illness \u2013 or any number of other professions that carry the responsibility of a great many lives \u2013 is that one with a mental illness who will not seek treatment because he does not trust his doctor.\nFor these reasons, philosopher Kenneth Kipnis goes even further. He argues that confidentiality should be \u201cfar closer to an absolute obligation that it has generally taken to be\u201d and that doctors should honour confidentiality even in cases where the patient might harm a third party. If patients come to doctors for help, doctors have a chance at avoiding a possible catastrophe. If patients lose trust on doctors and do not ask for help, nothing will be gained \u2013 patients will remain afflicted by their illnesses and people who might be put at risk by patients will remain at risk.\nIn the days before the crash, Lubitz searched online both for medical treatments and for ways to commit suicide, which suggests he was undecided as to what to do. So another way of thinking about his scenario is that perhaps if he had trusted his doctor even more \u2013 and shared with him or her the way in which he was thinking of committing suicide \u2013 his doctor could have done more to help him and to protect the passengers of the aircraft he piloted.\nWhat is relevant to reveal?\nLubitz\u2019s doctor also did the right thing by not revealing his depression to Germanwings because his depression was far from obviously related to his crime. Simon Wessely, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army, said that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a link between depression and aggressive suicide\u201d. J\u00fcrgen Margraf, psychologist and professor at Bochum University, likewise told NBC News that, given the sheer weight of numbers involved, you are far less likely to be harmed by a person with depression than by a person without depression: \u201cThe chances of killing others are higher for non-depressed than for depressed people,\u201d he said.\nFurthermore, given the lack of relationship between depression and the pilot\u2019s crime, it was not obviously in the public\u2019s interest to know about Lubitz\u2019s depression and morally questionable that his medical history of depression has been exposed so freely.

For chips such as DRAM, the spot market can often be an early indicator of a trend, but that's not always the case in the microprocessor spot market because it is far smaller.\nThe report says the phase-out of an older microprocessor family caused some product shortages last year and that may be happening again this year with Intel's Pentium E series Conroe family.\nStill, there is other anecdotal evidence of something going on in the desktop market.\nGartner noted Wednesday in its second quarter PC market report that desktop PC shipments gained traction among professional users in the U.S. The market researcher says that may be occurring because of growing economic uncertainty in the U.S.\nSince desktop PCs cost less than mobile PCs, they are a less expensive option for businesses with tighter IT budgets, Gartner said.\nIntel, the world's largest chip maker and provider of around four-fifths of all computer microprocessors, also noted some strength in desktop PCs during a conference call after its second quarter results, which were announced Tuesday.\nExecutives at the company said prices for its desktop microprocessors remained constant in the second quarter because of solid demand for desktop products in emerging markets as well as in corporations. Prices for Intel microprocessors used in mobile devices fell.\nOver the past few years, the mobile PC market has been where most of the growth has been, while market researchers have noted very little growth in shipments of desktop PCs.\nIn fact, Intel even noted that the number of microprocessors aimed at laptop computers it shipped in the second quarter beat desktop microprocessor shipments for the first time.\n\"We saw notebook unit shipments cross over desktops in the overall client PC category in the second quarter,\" said Paul Otellini, Intel's president and CEO, during a conference call. \"What I think we're seeing is a fundamental shift to notebooks.\"\nThe crossover occurred six months sooner than Intel expected, he said."}

His crime, he says, was speaking a few lines of Arabic on the phone to his mother, an offense that was too much for his fellow passengers.\nAs expected, many online reacted with disgust.\nIn this volatile climate where Muslim extremists are committing horrific crimes, every day peace-loving Muslims are being targeted with acts of prejudice and violence in an increasingly right-wing leaning world. It is, therefore, natural to expect sympathies to fall with Saleh. But dig beneath the surface, and there seems to be more to this story than meets the eye.\nFor starters, Saleh is a video blogger and a YouTube star who attracts viewers with provocative clips.\nIn 2014, a video produced by Saleh and his partner went viral where he exhibited racial discrimination at the hands of a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer. It started with the duo being ignored by the officer for starting trouble while wearing western attire, and ended with the pair being frisked when wearing traditional Arabic clothing. The purpose of the video was to show bias against people of Middle Eastern origin.\nThe only problem is that the video was a hoax.\nPlaying into Muslim victimhood, the video had been shared by the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) who later demanded an apology from Saleh.\nFast forward to February 2016 and Saleh was at it again.\nIn a video, titled \u2018Counting down in Arabic on a plane experiment\u2019, he tries to goad a reaction by counting down in Arabic as if he is counting down to an explosion.\nThis is to the annoyance of his friend and fellow passenger who is clearly as uncomfortable with the prank as we the viewers are.\nAdding to the suspicion regarding this latest incident involving Saleh, are tweets by journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien.\nThe whole situation reminds me of Yasmin Seweid, the 18-year-old hijab-clad Muslim girl who lied about being attacked by Trump supporters in order to escape the wrath of her strict family for being out past her curfew and created an international incident. She now faces a year in jail for carrying on with such a grave lie.\nWhat troublemakers like Saleh and Seweid should realise is that actual peace-loving people are falling victim to anti-Muslim sentiment every day. People like Faisal and Nazia Ali were actually kicked off a Delta Airlines plane for merely \u2018sweating\u2019 and saying \u2018Allah\u2019 earlier this year in August.\nAnti-Muslim hate crimes have increased alarmingly since the rhetoric from European and American politicians took a turn for bigotry. On the same day that a Muslim screamed out \u2018Allah\u2019 as he shot the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, a Tunisian Muslim asylum seeker allegedly carried off a terrorist attack in Germany, and a prayer hall in a mosque in Switzerland was shot up by a Swiss citizen of Ghanaian origin.\nWith every lie, pranksters like these may earn their 15 minutes of fame, but at the cost of diluting the struggle of those facing actual injustice. For every Saleh whose videos are picked up and then broken down as pranks, a real victim finds it impossible for someone to believe his story.\nHe might be a baiter but he has"}

Because of the budget deficit and a shortage of foreign exchange, the central bank has been putting pressure on mining companies to repatriate 40% of their export earnings pursuant to a 2007 government decision. That, and a proposed reform to the mining code, have caused tensions between the Kinshasa government and the country\u2019s mining companies.\nOn the production and price fronts, things are looking up now. Copper prices currently hover around $7,000/tn, sharply up from $4,500 just a year ago. And, improving matters further, the country\u2019s recorded copper exports were 15% higher during the first half of 2017 than during the same period of 2016.\nThe cobalt price is rising too, buoyed by recent announcements by governments around the world, including the UK and China, of their plans to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric cars. The London Metal Exchange cobalt price was $27/lb in October 2017, up from $13/lb a year earlier. Cobalt is an important component of vehicle batteries, with each battery containing an estimated 5-15kg of the metal. By 2030, global cobalt demand is anticipated to be nearly 50 times higher than what it currently is, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is home to more than 60% of the world\u2019s cobalt reserves.\nAs a result, Congolese miners have been busy. The central bank reported that copper production jumped 9.3% in the first nine months of the year, hitting 831,000tn. Cobalt and gold production rose, 18% and 5.7%, respectively. The net effect was a hefty 60% increase in commodity export receipts from the DRC during the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016, to more than $6bn.\nAnd the tax take is rising, too. The government raked in just under $200m in mineral export taxes in the first half of 2017, 29% higher than during the first half of 2017, and the figure edged to just over $200m during the second half of 2017. But with the rest of the economy in the doldrums, the overall tax take for the first eight months of 2017 was $1.9bn, 23% lower than during the same period of 2016. Figures for the fourth quarter of 2017 should be healthier though, and the government is betting that 2018 will be better still.\nThat will help it to weather yet another year of near absent donor funding. The country\u2019s traditional donors are continuing to sit on their hands, hoping to push the Congolese government to proceed more swiftly towards a political transition after President Joseph Kabila failed to hold elections in 2016.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted its first formal mission to the DRC in two years in November, but is still a long way from agreeing any new loans.

Nevertheless, those same officials, including Secretary of State Dean Rusk, secretly saw the Wall as potentially contributing to the stability of East Germany and thereby easing the festering crisis over West Berlin. Indeed, U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson had written that \u201cboth we and West Germans consider it to our long-range advantage that potential refugees remain [in] East Germany.\u201d This surprising viewpoint from Thompson and Rusk, among others, is one of a number of points of interest in declassified documents posted today by the National Security Archive.\nThe previously secret documents also reveal new information about one of the remaining unknowns from the period\u2014how well (or poorly) U.S. intelligence agencies carried out their responsibility. In one record, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s frustration shows through over the fact that he did not receive adequate advance warning of the East German move.\nSome of the documents posted today were released by the CIA through its CREST database at the National Archives, College Park. As a few of them are heavily excised, the National Security Archive has requested further declassification review. Other relevant documents\u2013CIA daily reports to President Kennedy during the Wall crisis\u2013remain classified because of agency insistence that sources and methods are at risk. The Archive has appealed these denials.\nOn 13 August 1961, East German security officials imposed harsh controls at the East-West borders in Berlin designed to stop the flow of thousands of refugees, mostly fleeing through West Berlin. Implausibly justifying the measures as a defense against West German aggression, the fundamental concern was the threat of economic disaster for the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). To stop its citizens from escaping, the GDR put up barbed-wire fences which soon turned into concrete barriers. A wall was being constructed (although it became a taboo in the GDR to call it a \u201cWall\u201d (Note 1)). Declassified documents posted today by the National Security Archive shed light on how U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts understood the East German refugee crisis and the sector border closings.\nThe decision taken in early July 1961 by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and East German president Walter Ulbricht to close the border was a deep secret. While no one on the U.S. side predicted a \u201cwall\u201d, diplomats and intelligence analysts saw the possibility of harsh steps to stop the refugee traffic. Nevertheless, East Germany\u2019s draconian moves to close the sector borders came as a surprise to President Kennedy. Declassified documents shed light on what some saw as an intelligence failure or at least a failure by intelligence agencies to warn President Kennedy and his advisers of the possibility of GDR action.\nAccording to a State Department report, the CIA Station in West Berlin attributed the GDR refugee crisis to the larger crisis over West Berlin. East German citizens worried that if Khrushchev and Ulbricht signed a treaty separating East from West Berlin, their \u201clast chance to escape\u201d would end.\nDuring the weeks before the Wall crisis, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson observed rather pitilessly that \u201cexcept for the danger of building up pressure for explosion [in the GDR] both we and West Germans consider it to our long-range advantage that potential refugees remain [in] East Germany.\u201d The implication was that the refuge"}

Numeracy skills over 10 years increased by just 0.5 percentage points to 95.5% in 2017.\nIn the same periods, the data shows a three-point improvement in reading and 2.7% improvement in numeracy for year five students, while writing skills fell 0.8 percentage points from 2011.\nYear 7 students showed the least improvement, with reading and writing skills going back by 0.3 and 3.2 percentage points respectively and numeracy results remaining unchanged.\nThe national average results for year 9 students showed a 3.2-point improvement in numeracy between 2008 and 2017 but a decline of 3.3 points in writing skills and 1.1 points reduction in reading skills.\nBirmingham told the ABC\u2019s AM program when asked about the year 3 results on Wednesday: \u201cAustralia has a high-performing education system by world standards with hard-working teachers and principals and good school communities.\nBirmingham said the federal government was investing in improving education and putting more specialist teaches in primary schools in particular, which he said would improve results.\nThe Acara chief executive, Robert Randall, said the 10-year-long data set showed \u201csome improvement across all year levels in most domains\u201d.\nThe results sparked further criticism of the Naplan system, which has long been criticised by teachers as putting students in league tables and not accurately reflecting educational improvement.\nUniversity of Sydney education expert Rachel Wilson told the ABC the national assessment system had been \u201ca very useful tool for directing resources to areas of need in education\u201d but the results represented \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d.\nIn New South Wales, year 9 students have risen to first in the nation for numeracy and spelling.

The tentative deal will expand and restore the Everglades, a key U.S. ecosystem, and relieve the sugar company from its financial bind.\nFor over 50 years, there have been a variety of efforts to try and repair the Everglades in South Florida from the damage done by farming and development.\nBut yesterday's announcement that the state will spend $1.7 billion to buy farmland from the U.S. Sugar Corporation would be the single biggest boost to those restoration projects.\nRepublican Governor Charlie Crist helped pull the deal together.\nGOV. CHARLIE CRIST (R), Florida: We have an opportunity to provide the critical missing link in our restorative activities. I can envision no better gift to the Everglades, the people of Florida, and the people of America, as well as our planet, than to place in public ownership this missing link that represents the key to true restoration.\nThanks to U.S. Sugar Corporation, we have a strategy to acquire almost 187,000 acres of land. That's almost 300 square miles.\nOften called \"the river of grass,\" the Everglades are a unique ecosystem that is both wet and dry, supporting alligators, wading birds, and a myriad of other species.\nAlthough many details are still being negotiated, the plan is to buy U.S. Sugar's fields, railroad and refinery that are located between Lake Okeechobee and the already protected land to the south, the Big Cypress Preserve and Everglades National Park.\nU.S. Sugar would be allowed to continue farming for six years to meet contract orders and labor agreements, but then operations would shut down.\nThe 77-year-old company grows and refines 10 percent of all sugar produced in the nation, but has recently been hurt by low-price imports.\nThis deal would not end all sugar production in the Everglades. Some 300,000 acres of land owned by other companies would remain in production.\nSugar farmers have long been the target of complaints from environmentalists for using polluting fertilizer and diverting much-needed water from the Everglades. Environmentalists were both pleased and surprised by yesterday's announcement.\nThis land deal could allow further expansion of the 44,000 acres of marshland the state is already creating to filter and clean the water that flows from the agricultural areas to the Everglades. It also could provide reservoirs to hold water that would be used during dry seasons."}

But her other business and personal ventures reveal a checkered history.\nSilsby has faced 14 legal complaints for unpaid wages in connection with her online shopping business, Personal Shopper. Employees won nine of those complaints and Silsby was ordered to pay $31,000 in wages plus another $4,000 in fines, according to the New York Times.\nShe's also had at least nine traffic citations in the last 12 years including four for failing to register or insure her car.\nLast July, Silsby defaulted on the mortgage for her Meridian, Idaho. But she used that same address to register a nonprofit, the New Life Children's Refuge - the orphanage operation linked to the current kidnapping charges.\nBut those who know her don't doubt her motives, noting that her problems usually stem from a lack of organization.\n\"In my heart, I think she probably went down there with good intentions, to help people that were in trouble, but it's a lack of foresight and planning, once again. She did that in her business life and it seems to follow her in her personal life,\" Bryan Jack, an employee at Personal Shopper currently suing Silsby for back pay, told CNN.\nSilsby, a divorced mother of two young children, now finds herself in the middle of an international legal firestorm. The group faces kidnapping charges for trying to remove 33 Haitian children from the country without documentation. At least 22 of those children were found to still have parents.\nEdwin Coq, the lawyer assigned to defend the missionaries, said Friday that Silsby knew she couldn't remove the youngsters without proper paperwork, but he characterized the other nine missionaries as unknowingly being caught up in actions they didn't understand.\n\"They were naive. They had no idea what was going on and they did not know that they needed official papers to cross the border. But Silsby did,\" he said.\nIn an exclusive jail cell interview with CBS News correspondent Bill Whitaker, Silsby maintained the group's innocence.\n\"We have not in any way trafficked or kidnapped children. We came here out of love in our hearts for these children and have done our best to help them,\" Silsby said. \"Once we were asked at the border to provide an additional piece of paperwork for the Haitian government, we willingly complied.\n\"I was willing to come back the very next morning at 6:00 a.m. to complete it and the children were going to remain there until I returned.

A few hours in, he is so tormented by his classmates, he throws a tantrum and has to be picked up by his parents. In the car ride home, after two hours of silence, Max begins to tell them how one of his peers peed in his canteen. \u201cWhy do all the other kids hate me?\u201d Max asks. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m weird?\u201d His parents, Kristina (Monica Potter) and Adam (Peter Krause), are speechless, but Max is overwhelmingly honest. It\u2019s a moment that showcases a realistic situation many people on the autism spectrum, like Max, and the families of those people unfortunately deal with regularly.\nKatims went back and forth about including Max in his loose television adaptation and even wrote two outlines for the show, one with the character and one without. But, by the time he wrote the pilot, he had decided that Parenthood was going to move forward with Max. \u201cI wanted to honor a kid like Max. And I wanted to be as brutally honest as you could do on a network television show,\u201d he said.\nBurkholder, who\u2019s now 16 and knew \u201cjust the basics about autism\u201d when he was cast, was determined to fully commit himself to the part from the get-go. Right after he was cast, he started researching the disorder, reading books, speaking with activists, getting involved with the advocacy organization Autism Speaks, and generally gaining a better understanding of what it means to be on the spectrum.\nSince Asperger\u2019s is a mental, not physical, disorder, Burkholder was tasked with portraying a condition that\u2019s invisible to the eye. \u201cIf you line up five people with autism against a wall and five people without autism against a wall, you\u2019re not going to really be able to pick one out,\u201d Matt Asner \u2014 the Los Angeles executive director of Autism Speaks, a parent of a child on the spectrum, and an avid watcher of Parenthood \u2014 told BuzzFeed News. Today, 1 in 68 children is diagnosed as being on the spectrum, but Asperger\u2019s is a type of autism that many people are still completely unfamiliar with. The syndrome was only added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1994 and about 1 in 500 people lives with it. It is commonly identified by an inability to make eye contact and show emotional connections, missing certain social cues, resisting physical contact, and a fixation on specific topics or eating habits.\nAnd what\u2019s made Burkholder\u2019s Max earn the favor of the largely underrepresented autism community, in addition to his standout performance, is the actor\u2019s approach to the character, as being someone who\u2019s more than his disorder. \u201cOnce I got the general idea of what Asperger\u2019s is down, I sort of stopped thinking of Max so much as a kid with Asperger\u2019s, rather more as just the character himself,\u201d Bur"}

For another thing, the gallery supports itself on the dues paid by its members - 25 of them to date.\nIn addition, the premises double as living quarters for their director, Barbara Sandberg-Morgan, who, in turn, doubles as professor of theater at William Paterson College. All in all, it is a loft setup authentic in all respects, from the cats that patrol it to the mildly bohemian atmosphere that pervades it. Small wonder that the place attracts visitors on the two days a week it is open - Thursdays and Sundays, from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.\nThe present attraction is ''The Feast,'' a group show organized by James A. Brown, an artist known for his expressionistic combinations of painting and sculpture, and also a teacher at Paterson. Mr. Brown's choices are seven - Manuel Acevedo, Willie Cole, Giza Daniels-Endesha, Nadine Delawrence, Manuel Macarrulla, Paul Powell and Bisa Washington. All have shown in Manhattan as well as New Jersey, and all, save Mr. Macarrulla, are represented by sculptures or works incorporating three-dimensional elements.\nBisa Washington contributes two of her all-black relief-effigies. In the larger and more figural of them, the contours are defined by wire bound in tape, the forms by fabric and fiber, and attached to one side is a machete. The second piece is a hollow form that is strung with the bound wire and lined with newspapers bearing headlines about Africa and Nelson Mandela, and again a machete hangs alongside. The work is menacing, but its effect would be more profound were the artist able to restrain her talent for the theatrical.\nReposing on and around the tiles are various objects, including a chair, two jars of water and a tall cylinder made of raw wood slats. It is an orderly construction, but the viewer groping for a train of thought finds only vague allusions to human and, perhaps, personal suffering.\nIn another piece, Mr. Powell expresses his mood more clearly but in a manner that is too close to the late Jean-Michel Basquiat's for comfort. That is to say, the painting in the installation is a white board covered with black graffiti - signs, symbols, words - and ornamented with one or two arabesques of stained wood. Five beer bottles with black images printed on white labels stand on top of the image and one is parked in front of it, on a block. The artist has a good spatial sense, but his thoughts and emotions seem stuck in a bottleneck.\nThe congestion in Giza Daniels-Endesha's art is physical. This may be because his installations, crammed with paintings, objects, fur, feathers, fabric and the like, are missing the theatrical performances that, the artist says in his statement, ''give them life.'' Certainly, the description of ''Gamaa''would be more effective spoken than it is written - in a Southern dialect yet.\nThese rambling assemblages have their moments - bottles filled with colored rice, a small figure dangling from an upside-down gibbet and"}

Morgan Technology Media and Telecom conference way back in 2012, CNET reported. \"Everyone will be on data share,\" Shammo said. \"When they migrate off 3G they will have to go to data share. That is beneficial to us.\"\nThat did not happen, but now the wireless carrier has decided to make another move designed to get customers to give up their unlimited data plans -- it's raising the cost by $20, according to CNNMoney.\nNew Verizon customers can pick from the plans above, but there's no option for unlimited. Source: Verizon.\nCurrently grandfathered customers with unlimited plans pay Verizon $29.99 per month for the data part of their plan. (They also pay additional fees for talk and text). The wireless carrier intends to increase that to $49.99 a month, it confirmed to CNNMoney.\nAT&T (NYSE:T) does not offer new subscribers unlimited data, but Sprint (NYSE:S) does, and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) no-overage policy might also tempt angered Verizon customers looking to defect. Upping prices by $20 a month is not a small increase, and it might be enough to force longtime Verizon customers to check out Sprint and T-Mobile.\nIt's very clear that Verizon wants to eliminate unlimited plans without actually doing so. It would be more honest and probably better received by its customers if it simply set an end date for grandfathered unlimited plans and called it a day.\nSqueezing loyal customers by raising prices and making things uncomfortable for them seems like a mistake. Verizon is clearly trying to have its cake and eat it, too, and that generally doesn't work out."}

Following legitimate shortages of the pint-sized MP3 player at retail stores, the Apple press corps began speculating that it was poised to join the iPod Classic at the gadget retirement home.\nRather than being discontinued, however, sources with knowledge of the situation tell Billboard that Apple is actually going thorough component supplier changes that have interrupted production of the Shuffle.\nAccording to various reports, the company has been telling its retail employees to expect a Shuffle shortage for an unspecified period. The lack of product has also led to a longer wait period when making a purchase online: whereas an iPod Touch or Nano will ship in 24 hours, a Shuffle now takes 7-10 business days.\nThe screen-less iPod Shuffle was introduced in 2010 and is Apple's cheapest music player, at $49.

He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Mary. Born January 20, 1942, to Fred and Florence Parkhill, in Chipman, N.B., he was a surprise little brother for John and Audrey. Winston studied Medicine at Dalhousie University (Class of '68). Winston and Mary moved to further his studies in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Toronto. This was followed by a Research Fellowship at The Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto. The growing family returned to Halifax in 1973, when Winston took a staff and lecturer position in the Department of Medicine at Dalhousie University. Winston was fiercely dedicated to, and proud of his children: Nicole (Allan Ferguson), Halifax; Mark (Jennifer Waye), Halifax; Chris, Ottawa; Jean Paul, Montreal; and Graeme (Jill Avery), Halifax; and his former daughters-in-law, Sarah Kimmins and Dawna LaBont\u00e9. Winston \"Papa\" held his grandchildren close to his heart and loved to impart wisdom and spend time with them. Anna and Mia, Jonathan, Jeffery and Andrew, Eric, Madeleine and Marc Antoine, and Jeremiah, were blessed to have a grandfather who loved them unconditionally for who they were and what they believed. Also, Winston loved to learn from his grandchildren, the ultimate teacher and student. In addition to family, Winston valued and actively maintained many lifelong friendships. He was always the life of the party; people naturally gravitated to his positive energy. Beloved by many, Winston took pride in his work and cared deeply for his patients, students and colleagues, demonstrating a deep love for teaching and an honest interest in the lives and well-being of others. He operated at the Infirmary, VG, IWK and QEII Health Sciences Centre. Winston was the Chief of the Division of Plastic Surgery at Dalhousie University, contributed to papers published in scientific journals and gave numerous presentations in the field of plastic surgery. He was a team member of many volunteer medical missions to the Philippines. He was an active member of several professional associations and served as President of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons and Manus Canada. Winston was a leader in his field. Winston embraced retirement. He and Mary spent time at the family cottage on Grand Lake, N.B. where he loved to dip his paddle in the water for a sunrise canoe down the river. Many will remember their \"invitation\" after a night of food, drink and country music. He especially enjoyed early morning games of cribbage with his grandchildren. After breakfast, there was always a project to do with labour, opinions and planning drawn from those conscripted. Winston enjoyed the special peace that doing a quiet project in the shed brought. Woodworking was a passion his whole life and, in recent years, he developed his carving skills. Winston and Mary enjoyed many trips including winters in Florida. He always looked forward to spending time with the members of the Eager Beaver Investment Club and his book club. This is a man who knew how to live. He actively encouraged others to find the beauty in each day. He taught us to be responsible and thoughtful and to set goals and"}

Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Samsung, GE and Cisco are among the initial members.\nGetting all these companies to agree was a big relief for Aicha Evans, corporate vice president and general manager of the Communication and Devices Group at Intel. Her company started two years ago trying to bring everyone in IoT onto the same page, she said in an interview Monday at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\"I had goosebumps, seeing all those companies,\" Evans said.\nOCF launched on Friday with few details about how it hoped to make all kinds of IoT devices work together. Evans filled out the picture a bit more.\nToday there are several software platforms for functions like device discovery and authentication, such as the IoTivity project and the AllSeen framework. But under OCF, there will be a single Apache-based code base, Evans said. It won't matter who made the device or the chipset inside it.\nOCF won't dictate the underlying network protocols devices use to exchange packets, but it will provide a common way to carry out key functions above that layer. For example, when two devices want to communicate or work together, they'll use OCF to figure out the best way to do so. That includes determining what functions each device can perform, what network protocols it's equipped for, and what spectrum is available in the area.\nThe industry had to act fast to make sure IoT would work in the long term, Evans said. She raised the spectre of a previous rough rollout when the first smartphone owners tried to use the mobile Internet on 2.5G networks that weren't ready for it.\n\"If we wait until everybody's putting these machines on the network, we're going to have a catastrophe. It's going to make the iPhone debut on AT&T's network look like a blip,\" Evans said.\nEven with the major players on the same page, IoT won't be easy. In the age of 3G and 4G, complying with an established standard has been enough to make sure products work together. Because IoT is more complex than simple voice and data connections for cellphones, companies will have to cooperate one on one to make it work -- even if they're competitors, Evans said.\nThe 5G era will be good for Intel, which has had some rough patches in the mobile business, because it will bring together cloud computing along with networks and devices, she said. Intel's strong position in data centers and its emerging small computing devices for IoT could bode well for its future in the space."}

The central bank's measure is not clear,\" the source said.\nThe central bank earlier this month announced that mortgage lenders will be required to cap their loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at 80%, which means homebuyers will have to make a down payment of at least 20% on new homes worth 10 million baht and higher, as well as for second and subsequent homes.\nMortgage lenders can still extend up to 100% of home value to fund purchases of first homes valued at less than 10 million baht per unit. The lenders will also be required to limit mortgages and top-up mortgages such as personal loans and loans for mortgage-reducing term assurances (MRTA) at 80% of home value for second homes and those worth at least 10 million baht, and 100% for first homes valued below 10 million.\nThe measures are undergoing a public hearing process, which runs until Oct 22.\nThe new requirement comes after the central bank found that the financial system was showing signs of growing vulnerability in the property sector, given the increasing share of mortgage loans extended to borrowers for second or third homes, with deteriorating credit standards.\nAlmost half of new mortgages in the second quarter had an LTV ratio of more than 90%, and those with a loan-to-income (LTI) ratio above five times made up nearly one-third.\nIn the meantime, Thai Bankers' Association (TBA) secretary-general Kobsak Duangdee said after a meeting with members to discuss proposals on mortgage lending curbs that the association will propose common requests by banks, some of which are in line with property developers' proposals.\nProperty developers have requested that the central bank rein in mortgages for third and subsequent home purchases, delaying the measures planned to go into effect in January for an additional six months.\nThe proposals will be submitted to the central bank before the hearing is closed next Monday, Mr Kobsak said, adding that each bank can also propose specific requests to the policymaker.\nThe TBA's board is set to meet today to discuss the planned proposals, he said.\n\"I cannot tell what will be proposed as it isn't finalised yet,\" Mr Kobsak said. \"Typically, stringent measures affect business operations but can help keep a lid on risk exposure.

The appellate court affirmed the students should be counted as attending Fremont or Woodland.\nFremont Superintendent William Robertson said his district would be seeking reimbursement and a spokeswoman said Woodland likely would do the same.\nBecause it received the funds, Prairie Crossing as a formality was listed as a secondary defendant but was not accused of wrongdoing.\nGeoff Deigan, executive director, said good arguments on both sides remain and the issue may not be over. The case reflects the need for funding reform of state-authorized charter schools, he added.\nDeigan said he hoped all parties could work with state legislators to create a model that doesn't \"overly impact any of our schools' resources and ensures there is equitable and fair funding\" for students regardless where they choose to attend."}

In October 2015, US federal agents intercepted a package of sodium thiopental \u2012 worth nearly $27,000 \u2012 that the Grand Canyon State was trying to import from an unidentified supplier in India and which had not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe state put executions on hold in 2014 after a botched procedure condemned as \u201ctorture.\u201d In that case, executioners administered a total of 15 doses of a new drug cocktail made up of midazolam, an anesthetic, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. Convicted killer Joseph Wood remained alive for two hours after the first injection.\nEven before Wood\u2019s botched execution, however, the drug cocktail in his case \u2012 and the method of administering \u2012 made national headlines, because the Supreme Court overruled a stay of execution. The decision overrode the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with the arguments put forth by Wood\u2019s lawyers that he had a First Amendment right to know the source of the drugs that would be used to execute him. They also demanded to know the qualifications of his executioners.\nThe Supreme Court did not address the First Amendment concerns in that"}
{"idx": "17171", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: A Crypto Currency Boom is fuelling a new startup financing market - But can it help Save The News?\nSo How Then Is PressCoin Going to Change any of this?\nA primer on Scoop\u2019s \"ethical Paywall\"\nFor the past couple of weeks I\u2019ve been working behind the scenes getting to know the team behind Presscoin.com, the latest participant in the remarkable Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom which is rocking financial markets around the world, and which may well herald an inflection point in the history of money.\nScoop Co-editor Joseph Cederwall brought PressCoin to my attention initially. And after exploring the PressCoin website and reading the white-paper, my initial impression of PressCoin \u2013 just three weeks ago- was one of admiration for the audaciousness of their plans, mixed with a healthy dose of skepticism.\nAs I dug deeper, and got to know the crew, I embarked on a fairly steep learning curve. To understand their plans I needed to better understand the blockchain itself (which can perhaps be most easily thought of in the case of PressCoin as trust mediation technology which can be used to facilitate cooperation) as well as the extraordinary boom in Crypto Currencies (1500% growth over the past 12 months). One of the things I quickly stumbled upon is the fact that it is in all likelihood the ICO Boom which started in earnest in July this year \u2013 that has been driving the explosion in the broader Crypto Currency market - and most spectacularly and the value of Bitcoin (BTC) the oldest and, for now, most valuable crypto-currency in the market.\nThe report that follows (Part one of a two part series) outlines what I have discovered in my inquiries, about PressCoin and its plans and the people and businesses behind it. It also provides some context around recent developments in the #FutureOfNews debate, to assist those who might consider investing in PressCoin to better understand the business processes the PressCoin project is hoping to address and disrupt.\nAnd I conclude by talking briefly about why I decided to join the team working on the project.\nMy Conclusion: The PressCoin ICO is certainly worth consideration, and if you are interested in the future of news like I am probably worth investing a few dollars in. Hence my deciding to join the effort to help it succeed.\nFrom what I can see most ICOs tend to be based around traditional disruptive high risk technology plans \u2013 companies hoping to be disruptive, to achieve exponential growth, and which aspire to join the ranks of the unicorns - or failing that be bought out by one of them.\nPressCoin by contrast is at its heart a collaborative play, a venture which plans to build its future around assisting an existing industry to better chart its path through troubled waters in a cooperative manner.\nAnd in a sense therefore it is a blockchain venture that plays directly to the promise inherent in this remarkable new technology - and indeed into the promise that the internet showed in its early days.\nOf course like everything at the bleeding edge of this technological maelstrom, it is a high risk investment. But at the same time it has - in my view a more credible plan than most, the possibility of systemic change - albeit a remote one, plus a great spirit.\nAnd consequently I have become a supporter and joined the team.\n20 years after I started working in the online news business back in 1997, it has become blindingly obvious in the past four years that an industry which looked to have such a bright future back in 1990s is now fundamentally"}

He could still remember the stern injunction his dentist gave him while he was in grade school.\nLater in life he would be told that he had so many cavities because he brushed back and forth when he should have brushed up and down. And still later he would be told that he had so many cavities because he brushed up and down when he should have set the brush in one spot, wiggled it, and moved on.\nBut the thought that he had cavities made Thistlewaite worry about his health in general. To build a strong body, he spent long hours stoking the family furnace, which was insulated with asbestos, and lying in the sun to absorb the solar rays everyone told him were so beneficial.\nEven when his head ached, he refused to take aspirin. Everybody knew in those days that, while aspirin might give temporary relief, its long-range effect was calamitous.\nInstead, he ate plenty of fruits\u2014cranberries, for example\u2014and spent hours jogging and drinking milk.\nAs a young man the fear of a heart attack made him give up liquor in all its forms. And when talk of cholesterol buildup frightened him so that his blood pressure shot up alarmingly, he gave up beef, candy and soft drinks.\nWhen sugar-free colas sweetened by cyclamates were introduced, Thistlewaite laid in a six-month supply and began drinking them like crazy.\nMeanwhile, he obeyed all the injunctions to get regular chest X-rays in order to be sure he wasn\u2019t developing cancer. Thistlewaite\u2019s morale first began to crumble on that day, a number of years ago, when a government agency announced that cranberries were harmful to your health. Even later policy swings in favor of cranberries failed to reassure him.\nThen he learned that some dried fruits could cause terrible con- sequences in his insides because of harmful substances used in their drying.\nWhen cyclamates were banned, Thistlewaite suffered another at- tack. The shift over to saccharin reassured him, and he was just beginning to recover his aplomb when it was revealed that saccharin could be harmful to his health.\nMeanwhile, it had developed that milk could be contaminated by chemicals eaten by cows, that some fish were being taken and sold from polluted streams, and that some poultry fattened chemically could contain health hazards.\nBecoming more and more alarmed, Thistlewaite increased his schedule of chest X-rays and began consuming large amounts of Vita- mins C and E, both of which someone told him would be of great benefit for whatever ailed him.\nMeanwhile, word that the asbestos he had worked around during his youth could cause cancer left his condition even worse.\nThen, in one day, he read that sunshine and X-rays could cause cancer, jogging could cause heart attacks, and Vitamins C and E, taken indiscreetly, could produce complex but terrifying results.\nHis only consolation during this period was in the scientific discoveries that aspirin could actually be of considerable benefit in coronary cases, and that moderate amounts of alcohol might even cut down the incidence of heart attacks.\nThat was how matters stood when poor Thistlewaite opened his morning newspaper and read that a dental researcher had determined that the suger substitutes used in sugarless gum could lead to cav"}

Miami FC were expected to be challengers in this season\u2019s NASL having won both the spring and fall titles in 2017. But just one week before the 2018 campaign was due to start, the league, which acts as North American football\u2019s second tier, cancelled its season.\nThe explanation for this can be found in various complex court documents involving litigation between the NASL and US Soccer, who stripped the league of its division II status following the collapse of a number of clubs towards the end of last year, among other issues. Whatever the intricacies of the ruling, Miami FC \u2013 who are co-owned by Paolo Maldini \u2013 found themselves without a league.\nIndeed, Miami FC, along with the rest of the surviving NASL teams, find themselves floating aimlessly. Others have already sunk, with some, like North Carolina FC, Indy Eleven and San Diego 1904, jumping ship to the USL, the former third division which has replaced the NASL as the second division. It\u2019s been speculated that Miami FC could follow suit.\n\u201cI think all options are on the table,\u201d Dalglish explains. \u201cWe just want to play, it\u2019s just a very complex landscape in this moment in time in Miami and soccer in general.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. The American game has come to something of a juncture in its recent growth. A lot of underlying issues have bubbled to the surface following the USA\u2019s failure to qualify for the World Cup. US Soccer\u2019s recent presidential election was a messy affair, as elections now tend to be on the other side of the Atlantic. Miami FC and the NASL claim they are victims.\nFor now, Dalglish\u2019s team have been entered into the National Premier Soccer League. It\u2019s not a division befitting of Miami FC\u2019s stature and ambition, with matches watched by just a handful of spectators. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ambitious club that I have been a head coach at and we will be back at some point,\u201d says the former Hibernian and Kilmarnock forward, who also enjoyed a spell at the Houston Dynamo as a player. \u201cAll we can do at the moment is take each game every bit as seriously as we would if we were playing in the NASL.\nSome rare good news came earlier this month when it was confirmed that Miami FC will be permitted to compete in this season\u2019s US Open Cup, the American game\u2019s FA Cup or Scottish Cup equivalent, but as a form of mitigation, it\u2019s a minor measure.\nOn top of all this strife, Miami FC now find that their toes are being trodden on by none other than David Beckham. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder, pictured left, has announced his intention to form an MLS franchise in Miami, with reports already claiming that moves for Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlo Ancelotti as manager are being lined up. Miami might have Maldini as a co-owner, but they must fear being blown out of the South Florida water.\nNot Dalglish, though. \u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he says. \u201cLast weekend, between the two LA teams, was probably the most intriguing match there has ever been in MLS.\u201d He is referring to the game decided by debutant Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who came off the bench to smash home a half-volley and head home a later winner.\n"}

De Ann Vaught, R-Horatio, to recommend increasing the division's spending authority and state funding by $3 million in fiscal 2020, starting next July 1, and again in fiscal 2021.\nIn the current fiscal year, 2019, the division is projected to receive $62.8 million in general revenue funding under the state's Revenue Stabilization Act enacted by the Legislature and Gov. Asa Hutchinson during the fiscal session earlier this year.\n\"They are always $3 million short for the last eight years and I was just thinking we could do it at the front end instead of the back end,\" Vaught said. The Legislature will approve the state's general revenue budget for fiscal 2020 in the regular session starting Jan. 14. The fiscal 2021 general revenue budget will be approved in the 2020 fiscal session.\nIn 2015, the Legislative Council signed off on Hutchinson's request to provide $3 million in one-time rainy-day funds to the Division of Agriculture for personnel and operating expenses.\nIn 2017, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge designated $2.5 million of her office's one-time lawsuit settlement funds for the division. These actions came after the Legislature declined in the 2015 and 2017 regular sessions to increase ongoing state funding for the division, despite then-House Speaker Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, making a boost in funding for the division one of his top priorities for those sessions.\nTuesday's legislative budget hearing was on higher education institutions.\nState Rep. Joe Jett, R-Success, asked Mark Cochran, vice president of agriculture for the UA Agriculture Division, to detail the division's budgetary plight. Jett noted that lawmakers have tried to shore up the division with one-time funds over the past several years.\nCochran said state funding for the division has been basically flat since 2008, and the division is a partnership among the state, federal and county governments.\n\"We've been appreciative of the one-time money, but it is very difficult for us to have the type of quality programs we have with one-time funding, particularly since at least 80 percent to 90 percent of our funding is in people and we can't have quality programs without quality people,\" he said.\nJett asked Cochran whether he expects to ask the Legislature for one-time state funding again during the upcoming regular session.\nCochran replied, \"Definitely. We are looking for about $3 million in the short run.\"\nJett asked Cochran whether a $3 million increase in the division's state budget would last for eight years.\nIn response, Cochran said the division has maintained most of its programs despite having flat state funding since 2008, but it has about 20 percent fewer people.\nJett pressed Cochran, \"How come we can't get the budget fixed on the front end, in your humble opinion?\"\n\"We have a lot of people that express value for our programs, but we are not getting any prioritized categories\" for increased state funding, Cochran said.\n\"As a non-formula funding entity, we were not part of the performance-based funding [system for"}

Thankfully, the weaker moments will be completely forgotten when Kara Zor-El lets loose in a way her cousin Superman can only dream of.\nIn \"Red Faced\", written by Michael Grassi and Rachel Shukert, Kara (Melissa Benoist) realizes that her hurt feelings over James (Mehcad Brooks) and Lucy's (Jenna Dewan Tatum) romance are tied to a larger anger she's refusing to accept. Luckily, a rogue military android shows up just in time for her to let off some steam.\nAny time a character from the world of DC Comics arrives to be adapted into live action, fans are eager to see how well the task is pulled off. The bad news is that Supergirl's version of Red Tornado is little more than a robot designed to give Kryptonians trouble (by using air blasts and cyclonic movement), not paying much attention to the actual source material. The good news is that it's no more or less nuanced than the weekly monsters with whom Kara has been forced to tackle.\nIt's an issue that continues to seem in need of addressing, with The Flash, Arrow and even Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. all realizing that season-long arcs, villains and serial storytelling is a safer direction. The Supergirl crew is entitled to learn that lesson for themselves, but it's impossible to not feel the pull of the larger plots or storylines completely drop when Kara enters combat with a one-note enemy.\nThankfully, the writers concocted a twist on the usual alien-vs-robot formula, having Kara's sister Alex (Chyler Leigh) fight alongside her, doing battle with Dr. T.O. Morrow (Iddo Goldberg) as Kara entertains his mind-controlled android. It's refreshing to see Alex actually fighting the important battle, and in a show priding itself on female empowerment, a grown woman without superpowers taking on the villain - and winning - is more than welcome. It's another day at the office for Alex, but as she takes out the one-and-done villain, Kara is fighting the real fight elsewhere.\nWe never had any problem with the show's feminist message, or its often tongue-in-cheek criticism of misogynistic or patriarchal biases and thinking. But the heavy-handed nature of said messages was a concern since the pilot episode, and the show has been hit or miss with its weekly affirmations or feminist examinations. This week gets more right than wrong, with the writing (and its execution) more concise than usual - and by the end of episode, touching something profound for a Superman character, or a superhero in general.\nThe less said about General Sam Lane (Glenn Morshower) the better, but the eye-rolling moments of ignorance, bravado, and predictable 'military man' shtick show the role was perfectly cast. After Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) previously explained how she can be a successful businesswoman and a mother(!), she once again gives Kara - and the women watching - some eloquent counsel.\nWhat do you do when you have all the reason in the world to scream at the top of your lungs,"}

But before traffic even started to roll over the new multimillion-dollar freeway, the pavement buckled in five places from the 90-degree June heat, leading to higher costs and more delays.\nThe incident highlights a wrenching debate that is playing out among state officials trying to stretch limited transportation money to fix or replace as much roadway as possible. In Minnesota and in many other states, transportation funding has lagged as road conditions have deteriorated.\n\u201cWe are undercapitalized,\u201d said Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Charlie Zelle. He has said the state is in \u201cpatching mode\u201d because of the funding shortfall.\nIn fact, Minnesota is facing a $2.8 billion transportation shortfall over the next four years, according to TRIP, a national transportation research group. The Legislature this year authorized $600 million in new funding for roads and bridges.\nThe national report said 44% of major metro-area roads are in poor or mediocre condition due to lack of funding. Roads in poor condition are projected to increase from 535 miles to 963 miles by 2020. The report also said MnDOT needs $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion to move forward with projects to reduce congestion and improve traffic safety.\nIn many cases, the debate comes down to this: an asphalt patch or a concrete overhaul.\nZelle said he\u2019d like to redo I-94 and other heavily traveled roads with concrete. But the decision to patch joints and cover concrete with asphalt is a matter of time and resources. The asphalt overlay on I-94 will last as long as a full concrete rehab, he said.\nMatt Zeller, executive director of the Concrete Paving Association of Minnesota and a former MnDOT employee, has a problem with the state\u2019s \u201cBand-Aid\u201d approach to fixing its highways.\nInstead of ripping out old concrete and laying new -- a costly proposition, Zeller acknowledges, but one that would last another 30 to 40 years -- the state routinely has covered up its aging concrete with asphalt, which is cheaper but likely to last only 12 to 15 years.\nAsphalt is a feasible and economical solution, even if it means going back and doing the work sooner than if new concrete were put down, said Adeel Lari, a research fellow at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs and a former senior manager at MnDOT.\nTo rebuild I-94, the agency would need $1 billion, or the cost of a Vikings stadium, MnDOT\u2019s Zelle said.\nHe acknowledges that by opting for the patching and reconstruction in bits and spurts, motorists likely will experience construction some place on the metro area\u2019s I-94 corridor annually for the next 15 years. MnDOT resurfaces I-94 between the downtowns of St. Paul and Minneapolis about every seven years.\nThe Paving Association\u2019s Zeller points to other projects where MnDOT has taken the asphalt \u201cBand-Aid\u201d approach, only to be back redoing the work sooner than planned.

Fiat Chrysler is offering free care for its employees and their families, about 22,000 people, through a clinic the carmaker opened this summer near one of five factories it operates in the area.\nAutoworkers in this blue-collar, central Indiana city have an eager helper waiting to pick up the bill at their next doctor visit.\nFiat Chrysler is offering free health care for most of its employees and their families \u2014 about 22,000 people \u2014 through a clinic the carmaker opened this summer near one of five factories it operates in the area. The company pays for basic care like doctor visits and consults with a dietitian and even an exercise physiologist. Workers don't pay a cent, not even a co-pay.\nThe idea: Spend more now to improve care and eventually pare the more than $100 million that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles pays annually for health care, just in Indiana.\n\"We looked at how do we change the health care delivery system, that's really what employers are asking,\" Fiat Chrysler executive Kathleen Neal said.\nCorporate America is jumping deeper into the care its workers receive beyond just giving them insurance cards and a list of doctors they can visit. Companies are opening clinics on or near their worksites or bringing in temporary setups to make sure their employees get annual physicals.\nIn many cases employers are offering free primary care or charging only a small fee. Many believe the cost is worthwhile because they can improve employee health and cut even bigger bills in the future that stem from unmanaged chronic conditions like diabetes or unnecessary emergency room visits.\nOffering convenient care can also help attract new workers and cut down on time away from the job. But this shift means workers will have to change how they use the health care system. And companies, which don't see individual medical records, have to patiently wait for some potential benefits from their investment like a drop in health care costs.\n\"It is really, really hard to change behavior,\" said Carolyn Engelhard, an associate professor at the University of Virginia's medical school who studies health policy.\nBig companies have long offered services to help employees recover from workplace injuries, and now more are delving into primary care.\nFifty-six percent of large employers will have on-site or nearby health centers by 2019, up from 47 percent in 2016, according to the National Business Group on Health.\nMost of the businesses surveyed by the nonprofit, which represents large companies, have 10,000 employees or more. But benefits experts also see this trend in smaller businesses too, with some companies joining forces to pay for a nearby clinic that they share.\nOffice buildings also have started adding clinics to attract tenants that want the convenience for their employees, according to Dr. Jeff Dobro, a partner with the benefits consultant Mercer.\nMattress maker Serta Simmons Bedding started rolling out mobile health clinics to all 28 of its U.S. factories a couple years ago to help its largely male workforce get annual physicals, with the company covering the cost.\n\"Most people just don't get their screenings, and a lot of men just don't have a relationship\" with their doctor, said company executive Steven Wilkinson.\nFiat Chrysler opened its clinic after learning that 40 percent of its employees in the Kokomo area didn't have a primary care"}

The company once exercised an unparallelled influence over the way affluent Americans dressed but is two billion dollars in debt and in danger of bankruptcy.\nIn 2012, Meghan O\u2019Neill, a writer and comedian, started an online video-collage series called \u201cJ. Crew Crew.\u201d Each video was made entirely with images taken from the J. Crew catalogue and followed the J. Crew Crew as it voyaged into a world of surreal intrigue and mystery. In one episode, a willowy detective in a tweed jacket and Ray-Bans travelled to an island wedding, where she attempted to solve a murder with the help of two child ghosts (girls dressed in J. Crew\u2019s kids line, Crewcuts); in another, a woman in a white linen shirt was abducted into a cult in which everyone wears jewel-toned special-occasion dresses. \u201cJ. Crew Crew\u201d made fun of the bizarre alternative reality conjured by J. Crew\u2019s catalogues, in which children and adults dressed exactly alike, Jackie O. and Helena Bonham Carter had combined their closets, and faux-quirky mean girls shared an unlikely, touchy-feely bonhomie. It was funny because it acknowledged how attractive that reality could be.\nFew brands have imagined their worlds as completely as J. Crew. From the eighties onward, the company\u2019s \u201cstyle guides\u201d were really life-style guides; they mapped the hours and days of a certain kind of charmed existence, showing how a recent college grad with a creative-professional job might dress for brunch, work, a date, a hike, a vacation, or a wedding. When the last full installment of \u201cJ. Crew Crew\u201d appeared, in 2014, that vision was still appealing. J. Crew exercised an unparallelled influence over the way affluent Americans dressed, especially at work; Michelle Obama wore J. Crew during state visits to Turkey and the U.K. It\u2019s startling to realize that, by then, the company was already beginning its decline. Sales at J. Crew have fallen for two years. The company is two billion dollars in debt, putting it in danger of bankruptcy. A few months ago, J. Crew shuttered its bridal business; earlier this month, Jenna Lyons, its president and creative director, announced that she would be stepping down; and, last week, J. Crew laid off a hundred and fifty employees and eliminated a hundred open positions. (Frank Muytjens, its head of menswear, is also leaving.) In an attempt to boost revenue, the company has started selling its clothes through Nordstrom. In 2010, when Nick Paumgarten profiled Mickey Drexler, J. Crew\u2019s C.E.O., for this magazine, none of this was imaginable. What happened?\nPart of the answer has to do with design. In the mid-aughts, J. Crew cracked the code of all-day dressing for the \u201ccreative class\u201d by combining the formal with the informal: it sold tuxedo jackets you could wear to the office and sequined blouses that could work under military jackets.

But today\u2019s statement officially confirms that a third, not-yet-titled movie will follow \u201cThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\u201d and \u201dThe Hobbit: There and Back Again.\u201d Part three of the Bilbo Baggins saga is slated for release in summer 2014. \u201cUnexpected Journey\u201d arrives this December.\nWhen decisions are made to stretch a story into more movies than originally planned, it\u2019s natural to assume that it is, at least in part, a money decision. By extending the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise from seven films to eight, or \u201cTwilight\u201d from four movies to five, or \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d from three parts to four, each respective studio gets yet another guaranteed box office home run based on an established franchise.\nUndoubtedly the studios backing \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d \u2014 Warner Bros., New Line and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \u2014 were happy about this \u201cHobbit\u201d call for that reason. But given Jackson\u2019s artistic integrity, this doesn\u2019t seem like a straight-up money grab. If Jackson says that he, Boyles and Walsh (who also happens to be Jackson\u2019s wife) agreed that they couldn\u2019t tell the story properly in just two movies, then I am inclined to think narrative quality was more of a motivator than ticket sales.\nStill, there is something to be said for keeping a story as streamlined as possible. The \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies, as originally released, each clocked in around three hours, give or take. The extended editions later released on DVD and Blu-ray padded out the running times even more.\nMy only concern is that Jackson is skipping over the swiftly edited version of \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d and going right for the extended edition, which may mean he\u2019s getting bogged down into much detail. (In his statement, he noted that he wants to share \u201cthe richness of the story of \u2018The Hobbit,\u2019 as well as some of the related material in the appendices of \u2018The Lord of the Rings.\u2019\u201d) Seriously, when a longer, director\u2019s cut inevitably gets released, it may take an entire week to watch it.\nGranted, this is a minor quibble over what most consider something to be celebrate: news that there will be more of Middle-earth for fans to savor, presented by the very capable Jackson. Indeed, in the short time since the New Zealander first posted the news about a third \u201cHobbit\u201d on his Facebook page, he has already amassed more than 12,000 likes."}

Twenty televisions mean there\u2019s a good view of the game(s) from every table, but spin the mood from gastropub to sports bar.\nThe menu veers back to gastropub, though: The food options (strong on jazzed-up burgers) are hearty but inventive, calculated for mass appeal but with eclectic flourishes.

The brioche-style bun was griddled for a crunchy browned edge. The patty itself had an excellent balance of spicy-chorizo flavor and meaty heft.\nStrangely, our server asked how I wanted it cooked (sausage meat, of course, should never be cooked rare). I asked for the kitchen to send it out how they prefer to prepare it, which led to a lengthy confab between server and chef at the semi-open kitchen and, thankfully, a medium-well but still juicy burger on my plate. Servers overall were eager to please, but sometimes seemed clueless, demonstrating an unfamiliarity with the menu and bringing dishes out at irregular times.\nMy other fave, the aromatically spiced lamb burger, was spot on, topped with a refreshing cucumber, dill and mint Greek yogurt. Its smoked gouda seemed unnecessary, given the perfect balance between patty and sauce flavors, but that\u2019s a quibble.\nBurgers come with a choice of fries: I liked the crunchy waffle cuts of sweet potato, sprinkled with a surprisingly sweet-salty rosemary seasoning.

Kenny is a great writer, and his book is a true pleasure to read; it\u2019s also a crucial addition to a development literature which has gotten bogged down in debates which will never be satisfactorily resolved.\nThe Success of Development acts like a sword through many of the Gordian knots plaguing the development community, especially those surrounding the rate of economic growth in many developing countries. Put that question to one side, says Kenny, and suddenly a lot of much more interesting questions, about issues like education and healthcare and clean water and human rights, come into a lot more focus. And if you use those metrics, rather than GDP growth, to judge the success or failure of developing countries, then things look rather more optimistic than you might think.\nthe proportion of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa affected by famine over the 1990-2005 period averaged less that three tenths of a percent. The proportion who were refugees in 2005 was five tenths of a percent. The number who died in wars 1965-2001 was one one-hundredth of a percent. These figures add up to stories of despair for many millions in Africa \u2013but they remain stories of the small minority. For the rest, progress has been considerable. Take literacy, for example \u2013the percentage of Sub-Saharan Africans who could read and write doubled over the period 1970-1999, from less than one in three to two thirds of the adult population\u2026 Between 1962 and 2002, life expectancy in the Middle East and North Africa increased from around 48 years to 69 years.\nThe biggest success of development has been in making the things that really matter \u2013 things like health and education\u2014cheaper and more widely available\u2026 We do not appear that knowledgeable on the subject of increasing the speed of income growth, as we have seen. In contrast, we appear considerably better at improving the broader quality of life for everyone, at whatever income. A greater focus on proven approaches to more rapid improvement in health and education may have a significantly greater impact on the quality of life of poor people in poor countries than yet another quest for the grail of GDP growth.\nKenny is soliciting feedback from anybody who downloads and reads the book; I very much hope that among that feedback will be an email from a literary agent who hopes to be able to place this book with a major publishing house who will put some serious effort into promoting it. Given the success of simplistic books on development by the likes of Jeffrey Sachs and Dambisa Moyo, this more subtle, more realistic, and much more readable book should by rights do really well commercially.

There are 173 charter schools in the state. The number has gone up since state lawmakers lifted the 100-school cap in 2011.\nCharter schools get money based on the number of students they have but don\u2019t receive funding to build facilities. Supporters have talked about trying to increase funding for charter schools.\nBut critics of charters say they take needed money away from traditional public schools.\nFor the study, the authors wanted to examine urban and nonurban districts that still have costs they must pay for when students leave for charter schools. The authors picked six districts that have seen rapid enrollment growth among charter students: Buncombe, Cabarrus, Durham, Iredell-Statesville, Orange and Union counties.\nThe study found the greatest impact of charters was on Durham, where 15 percent of the county\u2019s public school students attend charter schools. Under what Ladd called the most reasonable scenario, the study found that charter schools were requiring the Durham school system to reduce services for each public school student by between $500 and $700.\nCharter schools \u201cmay expand choice for some students while imposing costs on taxpayers and students that remain in district schools,\u201d according to the study.\nLadd also co-authored a study in 2015 that found that North Carolina charter schools were helping to increase school segregation.

But Bethel is not in the medical professional field.\nI guess I must ask: If its healing rooms and faith healings are so effective, why does Bethel involve themselves in science-based medicine, offering conferences with continuing medical education units? Follow the money? Another opportunity to preach their message? More scams to lure in folks to convert to their ultimate goals? Whatever the reason, seriously, I would prefer my medical professionals to have acquired up-to-date educational and technical experiences during their continuing education.

These dark aerosols cause the snow to absorb more sunlight and melt more quickly.\nWASHINGTON: Dust and soot transported from the deserts of the Middle East settle on the snow cover of the Himalaya mountain range and affect the intensity of the summer monsoon in India, a study has found.\nUsing a powerful NASA-developed atmospheric model, researchers from University of Maryland in the US found that large quantities of dark aerosols- airborne particles such as dust and soot that absorb sunlight- settle on top of the Tibetan Plateau's snowpack in spring before the monsoons begin.\nThese dark aerosols cause the snow to absorb more sunlight and melt more quickly. The findings suggest that, among these dark aerosols, windblown dust from the Middle East has the most powerful snow-darkening effect.\nIn years with heavy springtime dust deposition, the end result is reduced snow cover across the Tibetan Plateau, which leads to warmer temperatures on the ground and in the air above it.\nThis in turn sets off a series of interconnected feedback loops that intensify India's summer monsoon.\nMore than a century ago, British meteorologist Henry Blanford noted a connection between springtime Himalaya snow cover and the intensity of Indian monsoons.\nHundreds of studies have supported this relationship since Blanford first published his hypothesis in 1884.\nBut so far, researchers have struggled to explain why this connection between snow cover and monsoon intensity exists.\n\"Blanford knew that snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau wasn't the only phenomenon that influenced the monsoon, but he knew it was important,\" said William Lau, a research scientist who led the study.\n\"The relationship between snow cover and the monsoon is useful enough that the India Meteorological Department still uses it to develop its annual summer monsoon forecast,\" Lau said.\n\"By adding knowledge of the physical mechanism responsible for this relationship, our study may help to develop more accurate monsoon forecasts,\" he said.\nResearchers used the Goddard Earth Observing System Model to simulate 100 years' worth of springtime snow cover and its influence on the yearly summer monsoon cycle.\nTo test the effect of dust blown in from the Middle East, the researchers ran the same simulations again, with an added software package that incorporates the snow-darkening effects of dust, soot and other dark aerosols deposited atop the Tibetan Plateau.\nAdding dark aerosol deposition to the model substantially increased the amount of sunlight absorbed by the snow, accelerating the rate of melting.\nThis is because when snow melts, it begins to expose the darker ground underneath, which absorbs even more sunlight and intensifies the rate of melting.\nThe timing of the dust's arrival was also important. Researchers found that the strongest effect in cycles when a large amount of dust settled on the snowpack in April, May and June."}

A coffeemaker or microwave is practical; a family silver service is sentimental, a luxury. When Cindy, the central figure of Cherry L.F. Johnson's \"Half Moon Pocosin,\" marries J.D. in 1933 in rural North Carolina, she receives a black iron frying pan. \"You better take this,\" her mother tells her. \"You'll be needing it. A hard-working boy like J.D. has got to eat.\" As Cindy soon learns, \"There wasn't a day that came that she didn't use that pan.\"\nIn her first novel, Johnson chronicles a few days in Cindy's difficult life. Isolated on a small farm at the edge of Pocosin, a dense woods known locally as the 'cosin, Cindy works alongside her husband, subsistence farming. Besides working with J.D. hoeing corn, priming the tobacco and feeding the chickens and the hogs, Cindy cooks, cleans, does the wash and sews. She also wrestles with the thought of leaving home. In this simply written and poignant book, Johnson describes how a young girl reconciles the tedium of her daily life with her dreams of escape.\nJohnson describes Cindy's daily routines in meticulous detail. Much of her day is spent fixing meals for J.D. and Baxter, the hired hand; caring for baby Callie; and doing her share of the farm work. The novel's ordered and, at times repetitive, sentence structure reflects the boredom of her life: \"Cindy rolled the pieces of biscuit dough between her hands, making each one the same size as the one before it. She didn't have to measure or even look to compare the biscuits. She felt it. After you made them every day, twice or three times a day for so long, you just felt it. Always the same shape. Always the same size and weight.\" Like the biscuits she makes, her days are orderly and predictable.\nIn the midst of her difficult and lonely life (\"Some days when J.D. was gone, she felt like she was the only person left in the world, like God had come and taken everybody up to heaven but her.\"), Cindy ponders what might have been. As the daughter of a farmer's wife, she had hoped to follow a different path; she wanted to become a school teacher. But she follows her parents' wishes and marries J.D. because, in her mind, her parents always knew best. \"Dreams get broke, Cindy,\" cautions her mother. \"'Round here we don't have no big dreams. We can't afford 'em. Just like they don't have that fine china on them big ships you read about. Hit rough water, and they get broke.

At least parts of it will. As part of the massive tree plantation drive it has been undertaking for the last three years, the state government has decided to prepare saplings of this 82-year-old peepal tree and plant them at all the 206 shaheed smaraks (martyrs\u2019 memorials) across the state.\nA decision to this effect was taken by state Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar recently during a meeting to review preparations for this year\u2019s tree plantation drive. Mungantiwar said the administration has been given directions to prepare saplings with proper scientific procedure and following certain steps of performing a puja. \u201cThe entire procedure should be recorded and videographed to ensure transparency. This will ensure that there is no objection of any kind while preparing the sapling,\u201d he said.\nThat peepal tree is said to have been planted by Gandhi outside Bapu Kuti in Sevagram ashram in Wardha where he had stayed from 1930 from 1948. \u201cWe have started the work on preparing saplings of the peepal tree planted by Mahatma Gandhi. The tree has been shown to environment experts and they will decide how to transport it,\u201d said Wardha District Collector Shailesh Nawal.\nThe saplings, it is expected, would inspire and encourage locals to plant more trees and respect nature.\nSince 2016, every year, the state government has been undertaking a mass plantation exercise in July. After claiming to have ensured plantation of 2.81 crore saplings in a single day on July 1, 2016, the state government had announced a target of planting 50 crore trees over the next three years. Last year, it had claimed to have planted 5.43 crore trees in the first week of July. This year, the government aims to plant 13 crore saplings in the month and has been eyeing on planting another 33 crore saplings the next year.\nChief Forest Conservator of the state, Sanjeev Gaur, said experts will decide the best scientific option for creating the saplings. \u201cWe are trying to germinate it from seeds instead of taking the grafting route which can be a destructive process,\u201d he said.\nHe said strong and best sapling of peepal tree can be prepared from the seeds of the tree, extracted from the droppings of birds consuming them. \u201cThe plan is to collect the mud containing droppings of the birds found under the peepal tree and germinate it to prepare a sapling,\u201d he added.\nThe peepal tree gets fruits in the summer so the work would be taken up during the period, Gaur said. \u201cThe target of creating 206 saplings, one each for planting at the 206 memorial of martyrs in the state, would be taken up with immediate effect.

No fails!\nThe rush to make everything mobile has generated new ways to do business, new ways to organize ourselves and new ways to communicate, but mobile apps aren't your father's mainframe, desktop or laptop applications.\nNope, mobile apps exist in a world where not only is the underlying network transport anything from great to non-existent (which leads to all sorts of complexities), but also the polish and brio of leading mobile apps has created user expectations that, if I were to hazard a guess, are an order or two of magnitude greater than enterprises are used to delivering!\nThe issue of vastly greater mobile app user expectations is, I'd suggest, pretty much all Apple's fault. If only Steve Jobs hadn't been so obsessive about design values and perfect execution, all of the mobile app development shops would have a much easier time of it. But no, Apple DJ (During Jobs) produced the iPhone, the iPad and iOS, and along with those platforms the idea that apps should be slick, polished, responsive and beautiful became the norm.\nIf you doubt that users feel that way, consider a recent survey: The 2012 Mobile App Review by Apigee, a company that provides API-based services to support mobile apps. This survey (conducted online in October) of more than 500 U.S. mobile app users aged 18 and older, revealed some interesting stats.\nFirst of all, 44% of those surveyed said that poor performance would make them delete an app immediately! Moreover, 18% of them admitted they would delete a mobile app if it froze for just 5 seconds. Just think of that. Five seconds at best, immediately at worst!\nWhat's interesting about this low tolerance is the app could be trying to retrieve data from a slow remote server over a slow network, but if the app appears to be non-responsive, users will more-or-less immediately rate it to be a fail. Apps need to be built to deal with users whose patience has shrunk from minutes in the 1990s to seconds in the 'aughts, and now to milliseconds here in the 'teens.\nThe survey also found that freezes (76%), crashes (71%), and slow responsiveness (59%) were major deal-breakers, as was heavy battery use (55%).\nThe survey also found that how the app publisher responds will make a big difference in how users feel about a problematic app. Almost 90% said the No. 1 thing that will make them feel better about a failing app is if the publisher fixes the problem quickly with 46% wanting personal responses and 21% wanting a public apology (it's worth noting that failing to apologize appears to get 100% of Apple execs fired).\nSo, when you plan to release your next mobile app for your enterprise, whether it's developed in-house, bespoke developed, or a commercial product, think very carefully about how the app looks, feels, communicates, how it might fail, and how you'll handle problems if anything goes wrong. One hundred percent of users will \"like\" you for making the right decisions.\nGibbs is up on stats in Ventura, Calif.

His favorable rating was 43 percent, according to a Bloomberg New Jersey poll conducted June 20-23.\nFifty-eight percent of New Jersey residents disagreed with Christie\u2019s decision not to extend a surcharge on the state\u2019s highest-earning taxpayers, a measure that was revived for a vote this week by the Democratic-led Legislature. A majority, 51 percent, opposed his October cancellation of an $8.7 billion rail tunnel to New York, and 70 percent disagreed with his traveling via helicopter to his teenage son\u2019s baseball game.\nChristie campaigned on a theme of fiscal soundness, and in his first year cut $10 billion of spending, including a $3 billion pension payment and money for schools and cities. The governor and Republicans reimbursed the state about $3,400 for two trips aboard the chopper.\nThe governor\u2019s education-spending reductions were opposed by 65 percent and favored by 31 percent, according to the survey of 1,302 adults conducted for Bloomberg by Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-based public-opinion research firm. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.\nThe austerity trend continued yesterday, when Christie signed legislation to raise government workers\u2019 pension and health-care contributions, increase the minimum retirement age to 65 from 62 and freeze cost-of-living adjustments to help address a $53.9 billion retirement-fund deficit. The moves will save $132 billion over 30 years, he said.\nThe governor was viewed unfavorably by 53 percent of those polled. The results were in line with recent surveys that showed growing disapproval of Christie. In the Bloomberg poll, 45 percent said their view of him has worsened since he took office in January 2010. Just 25 percent said their opinion of him has improved, while 29 percent said it hasn\u2019t changed.\nMichael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, didn\u2019t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment on the poll.\nChristie often says he was elected to do a tough job, and he is governing as though he won\u2019t win re-election.

Ask open-ended questions such as \u201cTell me about how long you\u2019ve been with Bank XYZ?\u201d rather than \u201cHow long have you been with Bank XYZ?\u201d Using \u201cTell me about . . .\u201d actually requires your conversational partner to reply with more than one word. A conversation of one-word answers is, in a word, awkward.\nWork to Help Others Connect: Remember that working a room is all about staying in motion. Sometimes, a chatty Cathy corners us and won\u2019t let us go. Prepare for these situations by crafting an exit strategy. You might say, \u201cI really enjoyed meeting you, Cathy!

And don\u2019t think about taking a photo either; that\u2019s apparently illegal too.\nWe hold the unfortunate distinction of being a major city with more pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors, than almost any other city in the county. Sometimes I wish there were laws we did not have to pass, that perhaps common sense would prevail, but sometimes we lack common sense.\nThis is a subject we have covered many times on TreeHugger, and invariably there are dozens of commenters writing that distracted walking is stupid and people looking at their phones while crossing the streets are idiots. I get it. I agree. They complain that I should not be defending distracted walking. I'm not. I am trying to make the case that these rules have nothing to do with protecting pedestrians; they are actually about protecting drivers. They are about exercising control of the roads. That's the real reason for these anti-distracted walking campaigns and now bylaws.\nNote that the mayor\u2019s comment about \u201cmore pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors.\u201d Seniors do not tend to look at phones while crossing streets. However they do often act as if they are distracted, looking for cracks and potholes that might make them fall, going more slowly than young pedestrians. This law does nothing for them. Yet the mayor explicitly mentions them.\nIt is true that more pedestrians are getting hit by cars and more are dying. I have noted in earlier posts that this is an urban design issue, as our roads are designed to let cars drive fast, not to protect the pedestrians. It\u2019s an automobile design issue, as more people drive deadly SUVs and pickup trucks. It\u2019s a demographic issue, as older people are more likely to die if they are hit. The use of smart phones by pedestrians is a non-issue, a rounding error and an excuse for happy motoring.\nI get why distracted walking is an attractive target. As a largely unsupported trend, it\u2019s a media darling, and it\u2019s kind of funny to see people using phones walk into lakes\u2014especially compared to the banal carnage of car deaths. It also enables city politicians to act like they\u2019re responding to a safety problem without actually cracking down on the people who are doing the killing\u2014drivers\u2026 Devices like speed camera and red light cameras, which document and punish dangerous driving, are treated as unacceptable extensions of the surveillance state. But giving the police license to detain anyone crossing the street while looking at a phone? Sure, fine.\nTreeHugger totally agrees that one should not use a phone while crossing the street. We also suggest that you don\u2019t get old, have a disability that might slow you down, don\u2019t go out at night, don\u2019t be poor and don\u2019t live in the suburbs, all of which contribute to people who walk being killed by people who drive. This bylaw willfully ignores the real reasons pedestrians are getting killed, and instead is just more victim blaming.\nMore pedestrians are getting killed in the roads. Are their phones really the reason?"}

The claim stoked safety concerns and exposed minority students\u2019 distrust of university leaders.\nBut a two-week investigation by Iowa City Police found that a heavily intoxicated Owens was an instigator during several altercations that began inside the Eden Lounge early May 1 and continued in downtown streets.\nPolice said Tuesday that Owens would not face charges for filing a false report, fighting or underage drinking, and that they would not seek restitution to recover the costs of their investigation. They said they wanted to avoid lengthy court proceedings in the case that shook the normally quiet college town.\n\u201cIt became clear at some point that the community, not Marcus, was the victim in this event and it was important to us to get the truth out there,\u201d said Capt.

Owens and his friends later \u201cbeat the snot out of\u201d a person who had called another man a racial epithet, Kelsay said.

There are thousands of capable \"storytellers\" around the country that don't have the embarrassing, checkered legal history and immediately make you want to take a shower after hearing their name.

There's no possible upside to ESPN attaching their name with Jary Mariotti's name, and yet here we are.\nMariotti has been stroking ESPN's ego ever since he and the network parted ways, so maybe this new \"project\" of his came about because of that.

So what went wrong with Athelstan Spilhaus\u2019s vision of the future?\nIf Minnesota Experimental City had been a roaring success, you\u2019d probably have heard of it. Perhaps you\u2019d even be living there. You\u2019d also have heard of its chief designer: Athelstan Spilhaus. The sci-fi name sounds too on-the-nose to be true, but Spilhaus was real and so, for a time, was his utopian brainchild \u2013 at least on paper. Originally from South Africa, by way of MIT, Spilhaus was a postwar polymath in the vein of Buckminster Fuller.\nHe seems to have been an expert in everything from engineering to urban planning to atmospheric science to oceanography. And, like Fuller, he believed that science and technology could solve most of humankind\u2019s problems. If we could send a human into space, we could do anything. Spilhaus proposed such solutions weekly in his future-science comic-strip series Our New Age, which was widely syndicated in US newspapers from 1957 to 1973. Getting such visions off the paper turned out to be a different story, but an instructive one, as told in new documentary The Experimental City, directed by Chad Freidrichs.\nLooking at projections in the early 60s, Spilhaus saw that the US population was set to grow to 400 million by the 21st century, which translated into the equivalent of building 12 new cities of 250,000 people annually. This was in an era when existing cities were dying \u2013 blighted by crime, urban decay and \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. So in true postwar visionary style, Spilhaus rethought the entire concept of the city from first principles. He called it a \u201ctotal systems experiment\u201d.\nIn proposing his prototype 21st-century city, Spilhaus correctly diagnosed many of the shortcomings of the 20th-century one. He cottoned on early to concepts such as air pollution, even speculating that it was changing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. He focused on the problem of waste, noting that prosperity in 1950s and 60s America was being measured in terms of consumption, and suggesting that \u201cwaste is a resource that we don\u2019t yet know how to use\u201d.\nIn his city, everything would be recycled. He questioned the amount of urban space given over to roads, and proposed that the city of the future be free of the internal combustion engine, or at least that cars be integrated into a \u201cdual-mode\u201d guideway \u2013 whereby automobiles come off the road and on to a guided rail-like system that moves them around the city independent of the drivers. All of this infrastructure \u2013 transport, utilities, parking, air-pollution removal technology \u2013 could be built underground, leaving clear civic space at ground level. Spilhaus even anticipated that people would have personal computers in their homes one day, which they would use for shopping and education.\nMinnesota Experimental City, or MXC, began in earnest in 1966, when Spilhaus found a powerful ally in the form of Otto Silha, publisher of the Minnesota Star and Tribune. Their joint PR campaign brought on other well-connected advocates: a four-star general; president Johnson\u2019s physician; civil rights leader Muriel Snowden; even Fuller himself (at one point M"}

It had not only grown larger but evolved, gaining experience and taking on more responsibility as it matured.\nThat being the case, it was perhaps no surprise when, at age 34, the organization spun off a new unit of its own.\nThe 168th Air Refueling Squadron started life in 1986 as the 176th Tactical Airlift Group's Eielson-based Detachment 1. Its mission, under Lt. Col. Doug Clinton, was to build a tanker unit from the ground up.\nIn the spring of 1986, members of the unit -- what few there were - began a 17-day tour of other Air National Guard tanker units. This trip had a dual purpose, one of its participants would recount later: \"One, conduct interviews and make selection for the jobs ... and two, steal people.\"\nEvidently they were very persuasive, because the new unit was staffed by 16 officers and 65 enlisted personnel by September, when its first planes, four renovated KC-135 aerial tankers (military versions of the Boeing 707), arrived.\nObtained from the Arkansas Air National Guard over vociferous objections from local politicians, the KC-135s were hand-me-downs, and the 168th's other facilities were antiquated. Despite this, the unit still managed to supply 70 percent of the theater's air refueling training needs in its first six months of operation. Only two years after being activated, its first Unit Effectiveness Inspection resulted in a rare \"excellent\" rating.\nThe early days of the 168th, like those of its Anchorage parent, were not without tragedy. On Sept. 25, 1989, one of the unit's aircraft exploded on the flightline, killing MSgt. Cheryl Helgerman and MSgt. Bill Malico. Saddened but resolute, the other members of the unit pushed ahead with their mission.\nFor its first four years of existence, the 168th was assigned to the 176th, which was redesignated the 176th Composite Group in recognition of its newly diversified components. By the end of the decade the 168th had already reached operational maturity. It was redesignated the 168th Air Refueling Group and began operating indepently of the 176th (the 176th would retain its \"composite\" designation in anticipation of adding the 210th Rescue Squadron--see page 14). Under its new designation, the 168th would fly extensive hours in support of U.S. forces in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries.\nBack in Anchorage, the 176th celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Alaska Air National Guard by welcoming back an old friend, as Ruth Kulis, widow of 1st Lt. Albert Kulis, came up from California to visit the base.\nThat weekend \"will forever be one of the most important memories of my life,\" she wrote in a letter of appreciation. \"While you honor the Kulis family on such an occasion, you are also honoring my husband's friends who were part of the original 16 men"}

I think he wants the will of the voters to be implemented,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez, a former state representative from Miami, said.\nA Tallahassee judge recently ruled that a 2017 law, aimed at implementing the amendment, was unconstitutional. Earlier this year, Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson ordered state health officials to begin registering new medical-marijuana operators after deciding the law, passed during a special legislative session last year, failed to properly carry out the amendment.\nThe circuit judge found fault with parts of the law that, among other things, capped the number of marijuana licenses and created a \u201cvertical integration\u201d system that requires marijuana operators to grow, and process cannabis and distribute related products. Already-licensed operators worried that the ruling could create uncertainty in the fast-growing industry \u2014 while also allowing more companies to receive licenses.\nDodson\u2019s decision came in a challenge filed by Tampa-based Florigrown LLC, which was denied a license by the state and is owned in part by strip-club owner Joe Redner.\nThe Florigrown case is just one of a number of marijuana-related legal challenges Scott\u2019s administration is appealing. The most high-profile lawsuit is a challenge to the state\u2019s ban on smoking medical marijuana. The plaintiffs in the case include John Morgan, the Orlando trial lawyer who largely bankrolled the 2016 amendment, known as Amendment 2.\n\u201cThe governor-elect is considering a variety of options on this matter, along with a number of other important issues, and will be discussing these further as we move forward with our transition and administration,\u201d DeSantis transition spokesman Dave Vasquez said in an email when asked to clarify which litigation Nu\u00f1ez was referring to.\nBut, like many others, DeSantis has expressed frustration with delays in the roll-out of the amendment.\nOne of DeSantis\u2019 top transition advisers is U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Panhandle Republican who was a fierce supporter of medical marijuana when he was in the state House and has continued his advocacy following his election to Congress in 2016.\nDeSantis will \u201cfaithfully execute the will of the people on medical marijuana,\u201d Gaetz said in a text Friday morning.\n\u201cAs the author of Florida\u2019s first medical marijuana laws, I\u2019m comforted to know conditions will improve for patients under a governor fully committed to this objective. The governor-elect and I have discussed a variety of strategies. I suspect specifics will be refined in consultation with the health care advisory committee to the transition and Gov.-elect Desantis\u2019s selections for surgeon general and general counsel,\u201d Gaetz said.\nAccording to Nu\u00f1ez, who also said she couldn\u2019t answer specific questions related to the licensing caps or the smoking ban, DeSantis believes most issues could be fixed by the Legislature, which begins its 2019 session on March 5.\nThe new administration \u2014 which, under the amendment"}

They drew on data by Colorado State University and others and deployed shadow band radiometer instruments to measure visibility from once-pristine points around the West, starting with a station at an elevation of 10,525 feet atop the Steamboat Springs ski area.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to see as far,\u201d said Gannet Hallar, the Utah atmospheric scientist who led the project.\nThe peer-reviewed research results have been published in the science journal Environmental Research Letters.\nScientists first looked at climate and drought records from across the inter-mountain West. Then they measured the particulate pollution levels in air. They determined there was a strong correlation between drought and the amount of particulates.\nThe scientists also looked at records showing numbers of acres burned by wildfires each year. In current climate models, scientists anticipate the average number of acres burned may double by 2050. They concluded there\u2019s an even stronger correlation between the number of acres burned and the amount of particulates in air during summer.\nForest fires are expected to drive the increased particulates and haze obscuring views from once-pristine wilderness. The Zirkel mountains will be harder to see from atop Steamboat, and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains will be harder to see from the floor of the San Luis Valley, they said.\nAtmospheric scientists collaborated with University of Colorado land surface hydrologist Noah Molotch, a co-author of the published report.\nBeyond visibility, the increasing haze from particulate air pollution in Western states likely will have other effects \u2014 perhaps including a cooling effect on what are widely expected to be rising temperatures, Molotch said.\n\u201cThe amount of heating you have at the land surface is dictated by the strength of the sun. And when the sky is hazier, the strength of the sun is reduced. So you could actually cool the surface of the Earth by making the atmosphere hazier,\u201d he said.\nAround the West, forest managers in recent years have raised concerns about the thickening of forests because of aggressive wildfire suppression. To improve the health of ailing forests, some managers favor letting fires burn whenever possible, especially in wilderness where wildfire plays essential ecological roles.\nThese polices, too, may contribute to increased particulate haze wafting through the Western high country depending on the frequency and intensity of the fires, Molotch said."}

That&apos;s longer than the 30 minutes that company officials claimed Tuesday in a briefing with federal officials and Gov. Brian Schweitzer.\nAn Exxon Mobil spokesman said the longer time span was based on information provided to the agency by the company and the discrepancy might have come about because Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing was speaking without any notes in front of him when he addressed Schweitzer.\n\"Clearly our communication with the regulator (DOT) is the one that we&apos;ve got precision on,\" spokesman Alan Jeffers said.\nIt was not the first time the company offered clarification of its response and assessment of the spill.

The company had earlier downplayed government officials&apos; assertions that damage was spread over dozens of miles.\nThe governor toured the area Tuesday as the waterway rose above flood stage and stoked fears that surging currents could push crude into undamaged areas and back channels vital to the river&apos;s prized fishery. Conditions have hampered efforts to find the cause of the break.\nThe river has been flowing too swiftly for crews to reach some oiled areas, and forecasters said mountain snowmelt was adding to high water levels. Officials speculated that the surge may push oil into areas that haven&apos;t yet been damaged.\nCastleberry&apos;s wife suffers from heart disease and the fumes gave her difficulty breathing, he said.

And we expect those prescriptions to continue to increase as, yet a larger salesforce, goes into the field in the next few weeks.\"\n-- Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARNA) CEO Jack Lief on CNBC, June 11.\nLief was apparently so excited that he sold 38% of his stake in the company before the July 4 holiday. Investors are clearly not happy; Arena's shares fell last week, rebounded a little, but are still down substantially from where they were before the sale was announced.\nKeep in mind that CEOs sell shares for all kinds of reasons. Earlier this year, Lief exercised options he had and sold the shares immediately for a profit of more than $180,000. Perhaps Lief plans to use the $1.3 million windfall from the current sale to buy a house. Property in San Diego isn't cheap you know.\nMaybe he's just diversifying; he's ridden the Arena rollercoaster down and up and down again. Sometimes the front seat can be a little intense. And it's not like he got off the ride completely; he still owns almost $2 million worth of shares.\nBut if Lief thought there was a chance in the near future that Arena's shares were going to get to the highs the company saw in 2012 -- north of $11 per share -- it seems safe to assume that he wouldn't sell at $5.85. The inside knowledge of the day-to-day workings of the company says something about Arena Pharmaceuticals' short-term prospect.\nShares were sold under a 10b5-1 trading plan, so while Lief authorized the sale of the large block of shares, he didn't have any control over the exact timing of the sale. There's no reason to believe Lief thinks a large share price drop is imminent.\nArena Pharmaceuticals' marketing partner Eisai hasn't exactly rocked the launch that started in June 2013 with sales of just $8.4 million in the first quarter of this year.

We'll know for sure when Takeda launches Orexigen's (NASDAQ:OREX) Contrave later this year (assuming it gets approved).\nEisai increased its marketing muscle to 600 salespeople, but a lack of marketing isn't the real problem here. The only thing that's going to cure Arena, VIVUS, and Orexigen of their woes is time. Doctors have been burned too many times by side effects that have been revealed after obesity drugs have gone on the market, so they're rightfully a little apprehensive about prescribing the new drugs willy nilly. Over time, doctors will eventually become more comfortable with the drugs from Arena, VIVUS, and Orexigen and begin prescribing them to a wider audience.\nIf you're going to own the obesity drug makers, you should be taking a long-term perspective.

While getting the point across matters, the context surrounding the message also counts. Civilians tend to add many instances of \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d to messages making them less pointed and direct, and more welcoming and collaborative.\nWrite the way they speak. Veterans may note that a civilian\u2019s email tends to sound like the person speaks. This is very typical \u2013 many civilian professionals use email to confirm information or to deliver instructions for their team. For the information to be well received, the mail sender often will write as if the person is present and delivering the message verbally.\nLook for information, insight, and instructions. As much as tone and impression matter in email communications, professionals also know there must be substance as well. An email that is too \u201cfluffy,\u201d or ambiguous won\u2019t carry impact or compel action.\nFocus on being direct and succinct. By contrast, a service member or veteran is typically used to writing in short, succinct and direct statements, communicating the who/what/when/where of a message, rather than all the context that surrounds the message. To a civilian reading this kind of email, the tone might sound abrupt or inconsiderate of the reader\u2019s feelings.\nSpeak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. While every email author should be authentic and genuine in what they write, there is a tendency for veterans to cut to the quick. A hiring manager could be taken aback by the candor of a veteran\u2019s email, making it hard to consider a working relationship with someone who is so honest and forthright.\nUse military acronyms. Jargon, acronyms and abbreviations in the military are plentiful! Across the branches of service, the terms used to describe military jobs, duties, systems, protocol, and rank can be very confusing to a non-military reader.\nRemember who your audience is: The civilian employer. Emails should speak to the person, industry and company you are communicating with, in a tone and language they are accustomed to. As you learn more about their culture and norms, adjust your message and tone to be relatable and attractive. You want your email to reflect your fit for the company environment.\nRespectful (show respect for the process and the recipient by using a professional tone).\nFriendly (healthy communication and inter-personal relationships matter to hiring managers).\nSpecific (while establishing a relationship with the email reader, don\u2019t spend too many words getting to your point).\nCollaborative (avoid the \u201ccommand and control\u201d style messaging. Your goal is to start a conversation, not to instruct them on why they need to hire you).\nThese email addresses are not professional and send the message that you are still in active duty or still live in the military mindset.\nInstead, use your first name, middle initial (if you use it), and last name. If that email name is taken, consider adding a simple number or punctuation. For example: JosephPJones@Host.com or Joe.Jones@Host.com or JosephJones223@Host.com make it clear who the sender is, and doesn\u2019t distract the recipient.\nEmail communication is a critical part of the job search.

I\u2019m glad in a way, though, because I ended up finishing it in a new way, not the way I usually decrease stitches in a beanie, and I love the way it came out so much that I want to keep it. I had another hat like this in a color that perfectly matches my winter jacket, but I can\u2019t find it, and this new hat harmonizes with that jacket pretty well.\nMaybe I\u2019ll make myself another one.\nI have to say that we have plenty of hats coming in, and I\u2019m so grateful to all you knitters and crocheters. I talked with someone from the Franklin Township Food Bank last week, and they\u2019d love to have some hats from us. We have so many hats coming in now, that I will be able to take some over this week.\nBut what we don\u2019t have a lot of are scarves and mittens. Some of you, though, are making scarves with thick yarns like Lion Brand Homespun and Lion Brand Hometown. And that got me to thinking. I have a LOT of Lion Brand Homespun in my stash, most of which I bought years ago to make prayer shawls, except I\u2019m not making prayer shawls these days. So the yarn is not getting used, and yet it knits up fairly quickly because you use big needles with it. So I\u2019m going to do a lot of Homespun scarves this winter, not only to use up some of this yarn, but also to increase the number of scarves we can give out.\nThis is the scarf after knitting 18 inches. Now I\u2019m up to 24 inches. It\u2019s boring to work on, but it\u2019s going fast.\nI started my first Homespun scarve last evening, watching American Pickers on the History Channel. In a couple of hours, I got 18 inches done on a scarf that is a mere 21 stitches wide (about 7 inches). It\u2019s a sort of muddy gray color, which I think is fairly unisex, and I\u2019m happy about the idea of making a bunch of these. I\u2019m just doing garter stitch because it goes fast and that stitch won\u2019t curl. I think I\u2019m using a size 13 needle, but it\u2019s circular and it\u2019s not marked. Maybe it\u2019s a size 15.\nIf you want to join the fun of making hats and scarves for those in need, you might want to make them with thick yarn (bulky, #5 yarn) on big needles and see how it goes. You can just do garter stitch like me and come up with something that anyone would be happy to wear to keep warm.\nPosted in Uncategorized on October 31,"}

Like multiple prominent men before him this year, he was targeted because at least one woman from his past claimed that he had inappropriate relations with her, relations that fell into the realm of sexual misconduct.\nMr. Smiley, or course, follows film mogul Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K., morning show anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, and a host of other famous men who have lost their high profile jobs this year, swept up in the so-called \u201cMeToo\u201d movement.\nThe movement, in many ways, is a modern manifestation of the decades-long American feminist and women\u2019s right movements, where women recently have become empowered to not remain silent over the historical sexual abuse and advances of powerful men.\nI have no problem with this movement, at its essence. Sexual harassment is wrong, especially the quid pro quo variety, when someone in a superior position requests sexual favors in exchange for a job, success or advancement. Where I do have a problem, however, is with the way these modern accusations are being handled. In many instances, it appears these famous men are being fired or suspended without due process of any kind; this sets a dangerous precedent for American society and amounts to no less than summary execution. Imagine if our legal system adopted such practices, where people were convicted and imprisoned \u2014 or worse \u2014 without hearing or trial, and guilt was based solely on the words of others.\nWill the social justice of the MeToo movement one day affect our traditional justice system? American society mutates in different directions each day, it seems, now more rapidly than ever, and who knows what to expect from one day to the next?\nAnd what will happen to Tavis Smiley, to Matt Lauer, to Charlie Rose, to actor Kevin Spacey, to journalist Mark Halperin? These are men I have watched and admired for years. What will happen to them now that \u201cjustice,\u201d apparently based largely on the popular demands of a social movement, has publicly shamed them and killed their careers? Will they get second chances at some point, chances at redemption? No one seems to be asking these questions. But these men are human beings too with flaws \u2014 just like their accusers and the bosses that fired or suspended them. Let us not forget that.\nFilm director Woody Allen warned of a witch hunt of men over sexual harassment accusations, after Harvey Weinstein fell \u2014 a prediction that received little attention in the news media, showing how blind, self-serving and unreflective media members can be \u2014 and, by extension, the country at-large. Mr. Allen turned out to be prophetic. His own problems and history aside, he deserves credit for predicting the exact kind of mess we are in now.\nAlso, I know U.S. schools might not teach American history like they used to, but does anyone else out there see any parallels between the current sexual harassment hysteria and the dogged search for communists during the McCarthy era of the 1950s? Am I the only one with chills running up my spine?\nI predict that the lack of public due process these men have experienced will come back to haunt those who have failed to grant it. With injustice, what goes around comes around. There will be a future reckoning to match the reckoning the men have had to face over their past behaviors. We cannot address one crime \u2014 sexual harassment \u2014"}

{"idx": "17293", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Make sure the mulch isn't actually damaging your plants, trees.\nThe most popular practice for water conservation that protects existing gardens, especially in areas with low moisture, is to mulch. It's adding a layer of organic material around each plant to reduce surface soil evaporation rates. That layer also shades the soil so it and the roots remain cool on the hottest days. Mulches also prevent pernicious grasses and weeds from sprouting where they compete with our landscape plants for irrigation. In times of too little rain, mulching is one of the few measures we have to reduce its effect on our expensive plants.\nSometimes too much of a good thing can go bad, and a variety of problems can accompany mulching. Homeowners' best efforts can be undone if these aren't considered in advance. It's not just laying out mulch, it's thinking how to lay it out properly beforehand.\nLandscapers and farmers know this is an age-old practice learned from trial and error. They made mistakes, learned their lessons and moved on with new knowledge. To help you avoid this trial-and-error process, and the potential losses that accompany mulching, here's the other side of the story.\nMostly woody trees, shrubs and vines are vulnerable to having earth to bark contact above the base of the trunk. This causes the bark to die in a ring, exposing the vital cambium layer to death and disconnecting root from shoot. Without this free exchange, the plant dies.\nCrown rot most often occurs when these woodies are planted too deep, or when soil is mounded up around the base of the trunk. When mulch is mounded up against these same woody plant stems, crown rot occurs there as well. The rule of thumb is to leave at least an inch or more free of mulch at the base of all stems and trunks. Periodically inspect the plants to make sure mulch hasn't shifted up against one side. This will cause partial loss of the cambium where there's contact.\nMost mulches are composed of green waste ground to uniform size and density. Those for landscaping are most often woody chips and forest byproducts that are attractive and organic in origin. When you mulch around plants, the effect of lighter rains can be lost as drops soak into the very dry surface material. Little to none reaches the soil underneath and none to roots unless it's a soaking rain. Mulched plants may be dry as a bone in the root zone due to thick mulches above.\nWhen drip irrigation emitters are located within or underneath heavy mulch layers, you'd think every drop would be protected there. Truth is after a long dry period, coir, pine needles, wood chips and any other organic material will be tinder dry. This makes it potentially more absorptive than the soil underneath. Emitters in and under mulch can have much of their delivery wicked up into the mulch. So while your drip system is working away, the plant isn't getting water, only the mulch is. If you don't catch this before big heat comes, the plant dies.\nThe origins of mulch can be problematic too if it's predominately walnut and other trees that exude chemicals such as tannin to prevent competition. With herbicides modeled on these natural plant toxins, having wood from such trees in your mulches may have unexpected results.\nAs with all things in life, solutions in gardening are not as simple as they appear. Make one change to solve a problem and a new one crops up. Mulching is important to protect your landscape from drought, if you do"}

The 'knight in shining armor' who stood up for the elementary democratic right of the Venezuelan public to know about the democratic return of President Chavez to power after the USA-backed coup d'etat led by 'Dictator for a Day' Pedro Carmona Estanga, claims \"too much freedom!\"\nOf course, Izarra is on the other side of the fence now, he's got Excalibur in his hands and he's not tardy to wield the sword to slay his own perception of 'evil enemies' in the opposition and independent media! He goes on to tell AFP that Venezuela is a society divided into two and that, in Venezuelan, journalism becomes a \"political weapon\" and part of \"confrontation\" in a country where there is an \"excess of freedom of expression.\"\nFar from recognizing that TRUE democracy means the plurality of opinions that HMV (Chavez) is always talking about, once-upon-a-time media freedom fighter Andres Izarra wants to bludgeon the pro-Venezuela, anti-Chavez media into submission as unruly brats who suffer from \"levels of licentiousness!\" ?????\nRather than accept that there is a fluid debate, admittedly raucious and sometimes intimidating on both sides of the political pig-trough, Izarra goes nuts over the Venezuelan massmedia's lack of coverage of last weekend's presidential PR opportunity in eastern Sucre State despite the added bought-in \"attractions\" of Sean Penn and Milka Duno ... perhaps Keira Knightly would have been a better bet, but maybe her sponsored corporate appearance was more expensive than that of Naomi Campbell?\nIn what I suppose must be infantile jest -- since there is no other explanation -- Izarra says local and regional campaign ahead of the November 23 election is an \"accentuated media war\" where Venezuelans need to go to \"multiple sources\" to know what's REALLY happening in the country.\nEUREKA!

{"idx": "17303", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: NORTHAMPTON -- A year after Wired West clashed with state officials over its plan to build, own, and operate a broadband network in dozens of rural communities, the group has resurfaced with \"Plan B\" and a new sense of hope that the Massachusetts Broadband Institute, or MBI, will work with them.\nOn Saturday, the cooperative hosted a well-attended meeting at JFK Middle School in Northampton where they unveiled their new concept. The room was filled with local officials from across the region, most of whom have grown frustrated with the slow pace of rural broadband deployment in the state.\nWired West is still pushing for a fiber-to-the-home network spanning up to 27 towns. Its leaders are still touting fiber as a blazing-fast, future-proof technology, and say the regional concept would be more economical than one where each town goes it alone.\nBut now, following a shift in state policy, they propose to merely operate the network instead of trying to do everything themselves, including actually stringing cable on utility poles.\nUnder the new plan, member towns would manage the build of their own \"last mile\" fiber optic networks, using state and local funding. They could optionally get help with engineering and design from MBI.\nThe town networks would then be joined in a ring topology and connected to MassBroadband123, the state-owned \"middle mile\" backbone privately operated by Axia Networks.\nWired West would hire an experienced contractor -- such as Westfield Gas & Electric or OTT Communications out of Maine -- to serve as Internet Service Provider and maintain the cables and electronics. The contractor would provide \"wholesale services white-labeled as Wired West,\" said Jim Drawe, chairman of the cooperative's executive committee.\nPeter Larkin said Massachusetts Broadband Institute will work with every town individually to determine the best way to extend broadband internet to each community.\nWiredWest would take care of billing, contracting, insurance, and other oversight tasks, while outsourcing accounting and legal services, said Drawe.\nUnder the plan, the towns would bond for around 70 percent of their buildout cost, and 30 percent would be covered by a construction grant from MBI. Operations -- including the towns' debt service and required depreciation reserves -- would be covered by subscriber fees.\nDrawe said the fees would have to be competitive with Verizon in order to attract a high enough \"take rate\" to make the network sustainable. He said he's confident any network would start with at least 40 percent of all households on board.\nHe said at a 40 percent take rate, Wired West should be able to offer 25-megabit internet at $59 per month; one-gigabit speeds at $75 a month, and digital telephone services at $19 a month.\nDozens of towns in western Massachusetts still do not have residential high-speed internet service. The state Legislature in 2014 authorized $50 million to complete the so-called \"last mile.\" The earlier middle mile extended fiber to public institutions in rural communities using $40 million in state money, appropriated in 2008, and $45 million in federal stimulus funds.\nWhile some progress has been made in connecting homes and businesses with broadband, many unserved towns still remain at the starting gate. While some critics have blamed administrative delays, another reason is financial. Even with state broadband grants, towns will have to borrow money to get started.\nWired West insists that its vision for"}

Indeed, by certain measures equality has diminished considerably. Accompanying a minimum wage that, when adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was in 1968, and wages that \u2013 except for the wealthy \u2013 haven\u2019t risen in decades, the economy has polarized wealth to a greater degree than ever, reducing the economic classes more and more to the two extremes of rich and poor, and squeezing the middle class into little more than a memory. This lack of change is observable in, among other places, the fact that it\u2019s five decades later and people are still talking about jobs \u2013 coveting jobs as though jobs were those necessities and luxuries that work is obtained to secure.\nNotwithstanding this culture of work\u2019s ideological claims to the contrary, however, jobs are less preconditions for freedom than impediments to freedom\u2019s concrete realization. Beyond consuming most of workers\u2019 waking hours (consuming that which constitutes the precondition for freedom \u2013 time), jobs also wreck people\u2019s health, vitiating freedom in the sense of bodily movement as well. Moreover, that people are compelled to work a job \u2013 in spite of the job\u2019s actual function \u2013 demonstrates the consanguinity of jobs and dependency, rather than in-dependency. Some may counter at this point that needing a job is just a natural, unavoidable fact \u2013 that people must work to live. But the inordinately excessive amount of time that people devote to work in the US is less a natural fact than a cultural one.\nAdditionally, we shouldn\u2019t neglect to consider the fact that when people talk about \u201cgood jobs\u201d they are not necessarily discussing the correction of some pressing problem, or providing some truly desired service, or satisfying some actual need. When people discuss \u201cgood jobs\u201d they are primarily discussing ways to make money. If one can turn a solid profit selling known carcinogens, such employment will count as a \u201cgood job\u201d in spite of the fact that an enterprise like that wreaks more objective harm than good.\nContrary to popular opinion, then, people don\u2019t actually need jobs; we work jobs in order to acquire money. And money\u2019s another thing we don\u2019t in truth need \u2013 we need those things that this socioeconomic system only provides in exchange for money: food, housing, clothing, etc. Jobs are but a middleman \u2013 a means to acquire resources, not an end.\nThis exploitation, of course, is not limited to people. Even advocates of capitalist economics admit that capitalism functions by exploiting as much as it can: people, animals, plants, earth, water, etc. All are regarded as materials to be bought and sold, their value reduced to a price. So-called externalities \u2013 wholly preventable harms ranging from the ecological devastation caused by such practices as fracking, to preventable occupational and environmental diseases like cancer and asthma, among other concrete, systematic harms \u2013 are regarded as little more than inevitable, collateral damage.\nTo the extent that it bears on the relationship between freedom and jobs, it is worthwhile to reflect on the political thought of Thomas Jefferson.

West was, and is, West Virginia\u2019s greatest sports legend. His fame was never larger there than in 1959, the year he led the Mountaineers to within one point of a national basketball championship. National championships \u2014 or positive recognition of any kind, really \u2014 didn\u2019t come that often to West Virginia.\nNineteen fifty-nine was the year West walked into Harry Goldsmith\u2019s men\u2019s store in downtown Morgantown, where my father worked while in law school. West needed a dress shirt, and my father was astonished at the cartoonish shirt size he requested: a 15 \u00bd-inch neck and 38-inch sleeves. Jerry West was only 6 foot 2, but he had outsize hands and a wingspan like a pterodactyl.\nThose skinny arms helped West develop the sweetest jump shot anyone had ever seen. To this day, those arms are immortalized on the National Basketball Association logo, which features West\u2019s silhouette. West was an all-American at W.V.U.; he led the United States Olympic basketball team to a gold medal in 1960; he helped the Los Angeles Lakers win a National Basketball Association championship in 1972. He was selected to the N.B.A. All-Star team every year he played for the Lakers, from 1960 to 1974.\nWest says he was cruel, as a coach, to players. He likes to eat fast and play golf fast, and woe to those who keep him waiting. He repeats odd stories about himself in restaurants. In a Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House in Hawaii one night, for example, he kept sending his steak back \u2014 it was too rare or too well done. When the manager said he wouldn\u2019t be charged for the meal, West flew into a rage. \u201cI said that not only did I want them to charge me for my meal but I would never come back again if they didn\u2019t,\u201d he writes.\nTo smuggle in a West Virginia reference, West seems here like both the Hatfields and McCoys. He shoots himself repeatedly in the head, feet and private bits.\nThere is a back story here, and \u201cWest by West\u201d attempts a deep dive into West\u2019s psyche. He was born in tiny Chelyan, W.Va., in 1938. His father, an oil company machine operator, repeatedly beat him, West writes, making him feel defiant and unlovable. These scars were reinforced by a sense that he\u2019d let West Virginia down by losing that national championship in 1959. During the 1960s, his Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics six times in the N.B.A. finals. \u201cI realize that I sound like a permanent victim,\u201d he writes, but the fact of these losses \u201chaunts me still.\u201d To this day, he hates to set foot in Boston.\nThis book gets points for its honesty.

And accelerated warming in the Arctic compared to the rest of the planet could be a key contributor.\nThe heatwaves have killed dozens in Japan and Korea, triggered wildfires in California and Sweden, and led to prolonged dry weather in the UK and across northern Europe, raising temperatures beyond 30\u00b0C in Scandinavian sectors of the Arctic Circle. In Greece, the deadliest wildfires in more than a decade have claimed at least 74 lives.\n\u201cIt could persist for weeks, potentially for months,\u201d a spokesperson for the UK Meteorological Office told New Scientist.\nThe outlook was echoed by the German Weather Service, DWD, which warned this week of \u201ca continuation of the drought situation and above-normal temperatures for at least the next two weeks for Northern Europe, from Ireland to the Baltic States and southern Scandinavia\u201d.\nLast week, temperatures exceeded 30\u00b0C in the Scandinavian region of the Arctic Circle, with Norway recording a record high temperature of 33.5\u00b0C in Bardufoss, a town just south of Troms\u00f8. More than 50 forest fires raged through Sweden in mid-July.\nHeatwaves in Japan and South Korea have claimed at least 40 and 10 lives respectively, with high temperatures and dry conditions triggering wildfires in California. In Algeria\u2019s Sahara Desert, a temperature of 51.\u00b0C was recorded on 5 July, a record for Africa, and Canada has already seen 18 days exceeding 30\u00b0C, compared with nine all last summer.\nOne reason is that the jet stream\u2014a fast-flowing river of air snaking continually round the northern hemisphere at altitudes of around 6 kilometres\u2014has stalled over Europe since May, and could continue to do so, trapping regions of high pressure that are cloudless, windless and extremely hot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a key player in the astounding heatwaves across the UK and Scandinavia this summer,\u201d says Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University in New Jersey.\nShe says evidence is mounting that accelerated warming of the Arctic is a major reason why the jet stream keeps getting stalled. The stream is driven by collisions between cold air descending southward from the Arctic and warm air pushing northward from the equator.\nThe greater the temperature difference between the colliding air streams, the more powerful the jet stream. But the temperature gap\u2014and therefore the power of the jet stream\u2014is being weakened because the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, supplying the stream with increasingly warmer air.\n\u201cHeatwaves over northern hemisphere continents in recent years fit the hypothesis that rapid Arctic warming is playing a role,\u201d says Francis."}

No yellow smiley face punctuated the end of it, judging from its tone.\nThe letter, dated April 5, laid out the makings of a hostile takeover of Yahoo.\n\"If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks, we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders, including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the Yahoo! Board,\" Ballmer's letter read.\nToday, Yahoo's board issued a letter in response, which didn't budge and repeated earlier rejections of Microsoft's takeover bid as undervaluing Yahoo for its shareholders.\nBallmer's threat of packing Yahoo's board would have an adverse effect on Yahoo's stock, Ballmer noted in his letter. It would lower the value of Microsoft's proposal to Yahoo. Ballmer claimed that Yahoo's delays since the initial buyout offer have already reduced Yahoo's search and page-view shares.\nThis latest salvo reflects earlier reports that Microsoft's executives have grown impatient with Yahoo's refusal to accept the deal. Microsoft's sent its unsolicited takeover to Yahoo on Jan. 31, 2008.\nMicrosoft's initial cash plus stock deal offered $31 per share of its common stock, which initially set the value of the deal at $44.6 billion. However, Microsoft's stock value had declined as of Friday to $27.72 per share.\nBallmer's letter said that the initial offer -- a 62 percent premium -- was intended to create \"a speedy and ultimately friendly transaction.\" In response, the Yahoo board letter stated that Microsoft's offer and Ballmer's threat to replace the board were \"counterproductive and inconsistent with your stated objective of a friendly transaction.\"\nYahoo has tried to get alternative acquisition deals going with News Corp. and more recently with Time Warner. However, News Corp. seems to have bowed out. Its Chairman, Rupert Murdock, suggested that such a deal would not happen if that meant a fight with Microsoft.\nMicrosoft officials have suggested various reasons for wanting to acquire Yahoo, which have ranged from building up its \"social networking\" and entertainment capabilities, plus boosting Microsoft Live offerings, which are Microsoft's online-delivered solutions.\nSome observers have suggested that Microsoft wants Yahoo to help thwart Google in competition over Web ad revenues. Google is currently solidifying its acquisition of online ad firm DoubleClick.\nAs if to underscore Yahoo's value in that respect, the Yahoo board letter described how Yahoo is improving its online ad structure.\n\"Today, in fact, we are announcing AMP! from Yahoo!, a new advertising management platform designed to dramatically simplify the process of buying and selling ads online,\" the Yahoo board letter stated.\nAMP is a software tool that helps advertisers buy up \"impressions\" for online ads and target their audience based on demographics.

John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, has told acquaintances over the past year that he suspects that the election was stolen, but that he didn\u2019t challenge the official results because he lacked hard proof and anticipated a firestorm of criticism if he pressed the point.\nThe Massachusetts senator conceded to George W. Bush on Nov. 3, 2004, the day after the election when it became clear that the uncounted votes in the swing state of Ohio were insufficient to erase Bush\u2019s narrow lead.\nThe move infuriated some Democratic activists who felt Kerry should have lived up to his campaign promise that he would make sure every vote was counted. In January 2005, as Bush\u2019s victory was being certified by Congress, Kerry also refused to back a resolution challenging the fairness of the Ohio vote.\nMark Crispin Miller, a New York University professor and author of a new book about the 2004 election entitled Fooled Again, said he discussed the voting issue with Kerry on Oct. 28 when he encountered the senator at a political event.\nIn a Nov. 4 interview on Amy Goodman\u2019s \u201cDemocracy Now,\u201d Miller said he gave Kerry a copy of Fooled Again, prompting Kerry\u2019s comments about the 2004 election results.\nMiller and Winer said Kerry suspected possible tampering with electronic voting machines, but that he was persuaded by his campaign\u2019s top advisers, including veteran consultant Bob Shrum, that contesting the results only would lead to accusations that Kerry was a sore loser.\nIn an interview with me, Winer said the \u201cdisquieting stuff\u201d that troubled Kerry included reports that touch-screen systems had malfunctioned in such a way that voters who tried to vote for Kerry saw their votes switched to Bush. Kerry also was upset with reports that Ohio\u2019s Republican election officials shorted Democratic strongholds on voting machines, Winer said.\nIn some Democratic precincts, there were complaints that voters waited in line for hours or gave up and went home, while in heavily Republican precincts, there were plenty of voting machines and lines were relatively short.\nDemocratic activists also cited the disparity between exit polls, which showed Kerry winning by about 3 percentage points nationwide and carrying key swing states, and the official count, which flipped the results giving Bush wins in most swing states and a national popular vote margin of about 3 percent.\nSome defenders of the election results argue that the exit-poll discrepancies could be explained by Bush\u2019s supporters just being less willing to answer questions from pollsters after leaving the voting booth. According to this argument, Bush voters disdained the \u201cliberal media\u201d which they saw represented by the exit-poll questioners.\nThat explanation, however, doesn\u2019t explain why historically exit polls have been highly accurate or why the 2004 exit polls were on target when it came to the results for Senate candidates, while off the mark on the presidential race. Presumably, if conservatives were ducking the exit pollsters, there would be a similar percentage shift for statewide races.\nWiner said he discussed the election irregularities with Kerry in November and December of 2004. At that time, Winer said Kerry never asserted \u201coutright\u201d that the election had been stolen, but was \u201cuneasy\u201d about what he had heard.\nBut Winer said Kerry didn\u2019t believe the evidence existed to prove systematic tampering with the vote in 2004.

Little, Brown. $23.95. 256 pp.\nIt's one thing to hear about the disintegration of the family and quite another to read the true story of what happens to one family of children once they are abandoned by their mother. The tragic mistakes of the foster-care system often make the headlines, but what about the small heartbreaks and the simple pain of abandonment that aren't exactly newsworthy but comprise the reality of so many children?\nPaula McLain's story of her ordeals in the foster-care system is told with a dispassionate grace that puts a human face, actually three human faces, on the alarming statistics.\nMcLain is the middle of three girls whose mother drives off into the sunset with a boyfriend after their father goes to prison for a botched robbery. The girls--aged 6, 4 and 3 -- get shuttled between family members until finally a foster home is found for them.\nWhat they receive in one foster home after another are the basics -- food, shelter and education. But that's where the care seems to end time and again. Of course, the sexual molestation that at least two of the girls endure is so mundane as to be part and parcel of the landscape.\nThe last foster home where the girls wind up belongs to the Lindberghs, who have decided to become foster parents in order to provide sisters for their only child. Needless to say, this is a poor excuse to bring children into your home. And yet this couple offers a better life for the girls than anyone before or after.\nBy this time, the girls are 10, 8 and 7. The father, Bud Lindbergh, actually horses around with them and treats them like daughters while they are young, but the mother never opens her heart to them. When they are introduced to acquaintances, she is quick to point out that they are not her real children.\nAs the girls become teenagers, the Lindberghs continue to provide for them, while the girls continue to ache for something like love. Hilde, the mother, not only cannot show them any affection. She is sometimes physically and often psychologically abusive.\nFinally, the split between the foster girls and their foster family becomes sealed when they falsely accuse the eldest girl of theft. When the Lindberghs take a \"family\" vacation without Paula and her sisters, a sense of freedom pervades the house.\n\"Without Bud and Hilde, the house expanded like a lung, rising weightless around us. We drank lemonade so thick with sugar the granules rained toward the bottom of the jug. We stood with the refrigerator door open, took thirty minute showers, let the dogs on the carpet ... I strung a dream in which I was a whole family, all by myself: the mother and the father and the baby playing with its toes.\"\nMcLain's book is likened to The Liar's Club, a misleading comparison. In spite of McLain's credentials as a poet, Like Family does not have (nor does it really need) the lyrical power of Karr's memoir.\nHowever, this book has a power of its own -- the raw force of a memorable and well-told story of children who overcome the injustice of their abandoned state and grow up to fashion some sort of reasonable adulthood for themselves. You're likely to have a lump in your throat by the end of this gutsy and honest tale.\nPat"}

He wants to renegotiate NAFTA to get a better deal for U.S. companies and workers, and has threatened to end the agreement if he does not get his way.\n\"We will use (the China visit) geopolitically as strategic leverage\" said Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, answering questions on trade at the Mexico Business Forum. \"It sends the signal that we have many alternatives.\"\nGuajardo noted Mexico sends China a fraction of its total exports, and that the two major manufacturing nations tend to compete rather than complement one another on trade.\nHe also offered a rebuke to China on its trade policy.\n\"We all know that China is not a free trader, that's the reality,\" he said. But he added that Mexico has had success persuading China to ease trade barriers on some goods and expects it to continue to open up as its economy matures.\nThe trip to China would be in September, Guajardo said, but he did not provide details.\nA Mexican diplomat in Beijing told Reuters he was referring to the China International Fair for Investment & Trade summit in Xiamen. \"High-level contact is very frequent,\" said the diplomat, who was not authorized to comment.\nGuajardo said he was also working on a \"radical broadening\" of preferred tariffs with Brazil and Argentina to lower the cost of importing grains from the South American nations while giving Mexico better access to their manufacturing markets.\nThat would make the \"worst-case scenario\" of the U.S. withdrawing from NAFTA less painful for Mexico and strengthen its negotiating hand, Guajardo said.\n\"If NAFTA disappears, I can export cars (to the United States) paying 2.5 percent tariffs.

The sophomore came in leading the league with 23.9 points per game.\nBefore the game, Curry tested a few basketballs before settling on one to give the refs for a game ball. He was like a careful shopper in the fruit section of a grocery store, trying to select the perfect cantaloupe. He thumped it, he bounced it, he shook it and he found a ripe one.\nCurry's highlight-reel 3-pointer that put Davidson up by 13 in the second half even had his teammates shaking their heads.\n\"It was unbelievable,\" Wildcats player Max Paulhus Gosselin said. \"A step-back 3, between-the-legs dribble, shoot with two guys on him. I'd like to see myself shoot that.\"\nAfter pulling out to that double-digit lead, the Wildcats worked the shot clock, usually found Curry with about 10 seconds left on it and then just let him do his creative thing.\n\"He bails them out of a lot of situations,\" Wofford head coach Mike Young said. \"Stephen Curry is an awfully fine basketball player.

Three decades later we\u2019re still playing with toys based on the film.

The Ghostbusters line was revealed earlier this year at the New York Toy Fair, alongside some lovely How To Train Your Dragon sets. The Ghostbusters line is hitting store shelves now, and I got my hands on this sweet ride right here.\nPlaymobile is not Lego or Mega Bloks, requiring hours of building and a whole lot of tiny bits. The Ecto-1 set here is 79 pieces, and I assembled the whole thing in about a half hour.\nHow do you build an Ecto-1? Start with an almost completed shell, then add all the bits and stickers to the parts that don\u2019t look like an Ecto-1 yet.\nIt\u2019s not nearly as daunting a task as it looks from this pile of parts and bags.\nThe easy-to-understand instruction booklet is only 15 pages long.\nI will say that folks with big fingers looking to keep their sticker applications as accurate as possibly might want to use tweezers for placement. Note my skewed tail lights.\nI love the thick rubber wheels that come with the set. They give the vechile a bit of bounce, as if it had working shocks.\nThe way the wheels tab in to the undercarriage is really nifty.\nFrom hoses to translucent red lamps on the fins, Playmobil\u2019s Ecto-1 features a lot more detail than I would have expected.\nHere\u2019s the electronic bit. It takes three AAA batteries. In exchange it produces lights and that unmistakable siren sound. I\u2019ll drop a short video of it in action below.\nI would have been completely happy with the Ecto-1 as it is right here, but then came all the rest of the lights, tools and hoses.\nThe majority of finer sticker work takes place up top, filling in the little details of the junk the Ghostbusters packed on top of that poor hearse.\nAnd when you press those buttons on top of the unit, this baby really sings.\nOf course it\u2019s not all about the car. I mean, it\u2019s mostly about the car, sure, but there\u2019s also things like ghost traps.\nThey even applied a sticker on the inside to represent the glowy netherworld energy prison into which supernatural entities are sucked.\nThere\u2019s even a little sticker for the PKE meter, expertly wielded here by Janine.\nFor Playmobil people, Winston and Janine look mighty fine.\nEspecially when they whip out those proton packs.\nThe set almost comes with four pieces of translucent green rubber slime. Somehow I see this being used in places not related to Ghostbusters.\nI\u2019m really pleased with how Playmobil\u2019s Ecto-1 turned out. I\u2019ve put together and played with many a version of this vehicle in my time, from original movie toys to more recent Lego kits, and this is by far the coolest.\nNow all I need is the massive Firehouse set, and my Ghostbusters itch will be completely scratched.

Say you want to build a thriving business. You could list everything you think is important in founding, growing, and maintaining a startup, and build your company that way.\nOr you could focus on what experienced investors look for \u2014 not because you want to attract outside capital, but because you want to evaluate the same key qualities an experienced investor looks for when deciding whether a business merits their money.\nIn other words, build a company that has all the qualities a successful angel looks for... and you've probably built a company with real legs.\nThe same approach can apply to you, the founder.\nThe number one thing I look at when making a startup investment is the quality of the entrepreneur. In this, I \u2014 and a majority of professional angel investors \u2014 follow the old adage: \"Bet the jockey, not the horse.\" A great entrepreneur \u2014 especially one backed by an outstanding team \u2014 can tweak, improve, and refocus a business idea as needed, while a mediocre entrepreneur is likely to ruin the promise of a brilliant business concept. If I have to choose between a great business idea and a great entrepreneur, I'll take the entrepreneur every time.\nSo what about you? Do you have all the qualities a successful angel looks for in an entrepreneur?\nThere's no need to guess. While in the book he describes certain behaviors of great entrepreneurs, David also lists a number of warning signs.\nOf course you might say, \"Wait. I don't plan to seek investors. So an inability to communicate effectively with potential investors is a non-issue.\" Of course you'd also be wrong; while communicating with investors may not be important, communicating with everyone else \u2014 employees, customers, vendors, etc. \u2014 is definitely important. Any entrepreneur who lacks solid communication skills is working at a huge disadvantage.\nThe same is true for all the other items on David's list of warning signs. If you can't lead then your employees can't follow. If you can't grow with your business then your business can't grow. If you can't identify and leverage your real (not imagined) competitive advantages then you can't compete.\nAnd while you think you may never be an angel investor, you already are, because you've invested in your business.\nViewing entrepreneurship and your business from a different perspective \u2014 especially an experienced perspective \u2014 is incredibly valuable because it can help you identify weaknesses you must overcome... and just as importantly, strengths you can leverage."}

Ernest Cline's novel of the same name was first published in 2011, but the story's journey onto the big screen began before that. Most of the time, Hollywood likes to adapt classic novels that have a built-in readership and fan base, but sometimes, certain properties get caught up in a bidding war prior to being published. One particular novel that comes to mind for most people is Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park.\nWith regards to Ready Player One, Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the movie rights to the novel in 2010 for Farah Films and De Line Pictures to produce, and that's when work on the inevitable film adaptation began. What's interesting, Cline says he had finished his draft of the script before the book even released. While the project went through several years of development before finally moving into pre-production in 2015 and principal photography in 2016, the film didn't end up hitting theaters in March 2018 - just about eight years after the book's rights had first been acquired.\nRelated: Why Is The Movie Called Ready Player One Anyway?\n\"In early 2010, Ernie gave me a draft of Ready Player One, the novel that he'd been working on and he'd been telling me about, and it was fantastic. And we went in search of a book agent, a partner-in-crime on the book side. We took the book out to publishers in June of 2010, and we found ourselves in a giant publishing bidding war. ...And then, as a producer, I took the book into all the movie studios and Warner Bros. absolutely loved the book. And it was in that process that I partnered up with Donald De Line to produce the movie and develop the adaptation.\"\n\"Steven came on spring of 2015 not only to direct but also to be our lead producing partner.

In the end, everyone involved with Spielberg's film walked away happy with what they created - and for them, that six-year journey (eight years for Cline and Farah) was well worth it.\nReady Player One is out now on Blu-ray and digital HD.\nUpdate: This article has been updated with clarified language on the early stages of development."}

Gossip Cop can debunk the bogus story, which further alleges the actor\u2019s night was ruined by the snub. The report simply isn\u2019t true.\nA Star Is Born was nominated for several awards at the Golden Globes, but it only managed to take home the win for Best Original Song. Cooper lost Best Actor to Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek, whose Queen biopic beat out A Star Is Born for Best Drama. He also lost the award for Best Director to Roma filmmaker Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. A supposed source tells OK! that Cooper \u201cfelt like a fool\u201d following the ceremony as everyone had told him \u201che was a shoo-in\u201d to sweep the awards.\nThe idea that the actor\u2019s girlfriend added to his so-called \u201cterrible night\u201d isn\u2019t true either. In reality, Cooper and Shayk showed a lot of PDA at the Golden Globes. Not only did the couple hold hands and smile while walking the red carpet, but the model was later photographed fixing Cooper\u2019s tie at their table. Shayk was also spotted putting her hand on her boyfriend\u2019s leg and resting her head on his shoulder during the ceremony. Just two days later, Shayk accompanied Cooper to the National Board of Review awards gala.\nLast week, OK!\u2019s sister publication, In Touch, made up a story about Gaga and Shayk getting into a fight over Cooper at the Golden Globes.

It was a welcome departure from our experience in previous elections, when it took days, weeks, or even months to know who had won the presidential election.\nThe problem this time is that in the middle of the quick count \u2013 the transmission of election figures to Transparency Server, from which the PPCRV got the results which it quickly released to media \u2014 someone in Smartmatic opened the system to order that \u201c?\u201d be corrected to \u201c\u00f1\u201d in the names of two candidates.

Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. noticed that votes for his top vice-presidential rival, Rep. Leni Robredo, began to rise until they overtook Marcos\u2019 votes. The Marcos camp thus called for a manual recount of the votes for vice president.\nThe PPCRV has already stopped its unofficial quick count to give way to the official count for president and vice president to be done by Congress, as provided by the Constitution. The Senate has been receiving the official returns for sometime now. It and the House of Representatives are to meet in joint session tomorrow, Tuesday, May 24, to carry out this constitutional duty.\nIt is this official count by Congress that matters, not the quick count which has been mired in controversy as far as the vice-presidential count is concerned. It is at this official count where all the parties concerned should now focus their attention, with the Marcos camp closely watching to ensure that the irregularity it saw in the quick count does not come up in the official Congress canvass.\nAny investigation on the Comelec-Smartmatic-Transparency Server-PPCRV quick count will have no effect on the official canvass by Congress. But it may serve to expose and penalize a violation by a Smartmatic employee and possibly a Comelec official. Their opening of the system to make seemingly minor spelling corrections was a violation of established protocol, for which penalties are due.

But their defense only helps get to an important fact: It\u2019s not just the natural disasters that kill people, but the government\u2019s inability to react to the aftermath.\nPeople in Puerto Rico died because they didn\u2019t have water or electricity for months as a result of the hurricane\u2019s destruction.

Apple made $34 billion on 29 billion app downloads in 2016, according to the company's data. Google, by comparison, made $10 billion on 63 billion downloads in 2016.\nPut another way, Apple made more than three times as much money as Google with less than half as many downloads.\nWhile data has long shown that iOS users are more likely to pay for apps than their Android-using counterparts, there's a China-sized reason for the disparity. Because Google Play doesn't have a presence in China, third-party app stores \u2014 like those from Baidu and Xiaomi \u2014 dominate the market, even though Apple's China business is growing.\nThe result is that Google, whose users were already somewhat notorious for not spending money on apps, is losing out on huge amounts of revenue by not having its Play Store in China.\nThis becomes even more apparent looking at App Annie's forecast for next year. Apple is projected to make $40 billion off 30 billion downloads while Google is expected to make $21 billion off 114 billion downloads. Meanwhile, alternative Android app stores are projected to make $20 billion on 51 billion downloads in 2017.\nBut it's not all bad news for Google. Google's revenue is growing at faster rate than that of other Android app stores and downloads have already far outpaced Apple's.

A few years ago Dropbox decided it was going to move the majority of its infrastructure requirements from AWS into its own data centers. As you can imagine, it took a monumental effort, but the company believed that the advantages of controlling its own destiny would be worth all of the challenges they faced to get there.\nThe first step was building the infrastructure to replace it. We\u2019re talking about a company that had 1500 employees, with just around a dozen on the infrastructure team. This was not a huge operation, yet what they were trying to do was build something themselves at web scale that only a small number of companies with much larger teams had tried to this point.\nThat included building and equipping three US data centers. It also meant building the network backbone, the infrastructure that facilitated the connections between the US data centers and other facilities they had located throughout the world. When you open Dropbox and request a file, you want your file to download pretty much instantaneously without latency, and it was up to the team to ensure that happened, while trying to navigate between the old system and the new one.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s neat about the backbone is that it\u2019s similar to something you might find at Google or Facebook, but we built this with a relatively small team,\u201d Dan Williams, head of production engineering at Dropbox told TechCrunch. And that small team had to build the backbone and move all of that the content, all while keeping the service up and running.\nWilliams says for Dropbox, building the network was a business decision and it has had a positive impact on the business overall. \u201cI think it could be argued in fact that anyone who has built a decent-sized network like this has had some effect on the business in a positive way that is actually building trust for the user and getting more users to adopt the product or service based on the quality of the service\u201d Williams explained.\nThe new system has certainly had a positive impact on Dropbox\u2019s reputation with enterprise IT too. Back in the day, Dropbox often had a bad rep with IT because of unauthorized usage inside large organizations. Today, the Dropbox Business line of products combined with this in-house infrastructure and network has created a level of trust they didn\u2019t have before. Williams points out that they have such detailed insight into the networking operation, they can use that data as a sales driver, even though they didn\u2019t end up charging for this change.\n\u201cOne of our core beliefs is providing a high-performance, low-expense product.\u201d He believes that\u2019s why they have been able to retain old customers through this transition, while also growing the user base over time.\nWhether the cost of ownership went down in real terms, the company believes it achieved its objectives by building it themselves. \u201cWhile cost is always something that we consider, our goal with our network expansion was to improve performance, reliability, flexibility and control for our users \u2014 which we have succeeded in doing,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThat build versus buy decision is never an easy one, especially for a company the size of Dropbox, which had to walk the line between the two systems while it made the transition, but today it appears to have paid off in a big way for them."}

But it sometimes offers children like him a chance to stay - if their parents agree to leave.\nMATSUDO, Japan \u2013 Gursewak Singh composed his first letter to Japan\u2019s justice minister when he was 10 years old. Almost seven years later, he is still writing. In all, he has written more than 50 letters.\nHe has yet to get a reply.\nThe letters, all written in Japanese, have become more eloquent as Gursewak has grown up. But the message is unchanged \u2013 a plea to the Japanese authorities to recognize him and his family as residents in a country where he and his younger twin siblings were born and his parents, natives of India, have lived since the 1990s.\nGursewak\u2019s parents, who are Sikhs, fled to Japan from India in the 1990s. For several years, they lived without visas under the radar of the authorities until they were put on a status known as \u201cprovisional release\u201d in 2001. It means they can stay in Japan as long as their asylum application is under review.\nBut it also means they can\u2019t work, they don\u2019t have health insurance and they need permission to travel outside the prefecture where they live. They are also subject to unannounced inspections by immigration officers at their home and they face detention at any time. There are currently some 4,700 people with this status living in Japan.\nGursewak, who has never left Japan, has inherited his parents\u2019 provisional release status and all the restrictions that go with it. That fate has exposed him and more than 500 other children who share his predicament to lives of perpetual uncertainty. They can go to government-run schools, where tuition is largely free, but university is out of reach for most because they and their parents aren\u2019t allowed to work and so can\u2019t afford the fees. These children, many of whom are asylum seekers, will soon face a stark choice between forced unemployment and working illegally.\nInterviews with some two dozen children on provisional release from 11 countries, including Vietnam, Pakistan and Ghana, reveal stories that are similar to the one told by Gursewak. Their experiences highlight Japan\u2019s deep reluctance to accept foreigners, even as the country\u2019s population ages and its workforce shrinks. Earlier this year, Reuters exposed how asylum seekers on provisional release are working without permits to provide the muscle on government-funded road and infrastructure projects, even as Japan says they must leave.\nWhile there were almost 14,000 asylum cases under review at the end of 2015, Japan accepted only 27 refugees last year.

A group - including Vera Brittain, HG Wells and Harold Laski, and led by Ronald Kidd - came together in concern at the \"general and alarming tendency to encroach on the liberty of the citizen\".\nWhen the policing of the hunger marchers provoked our founders into action, they could hardly have imagined the role the organisation would play in modern Britain as the guardian of rights and freedoms. Nor could they have anticipated that the work they took up as legal observers when the march reached Hyde Park would turn into what Kidd's friend EM Forster described as \"the fight that is never done\".\nThe resonance between the year of Liberty's birth and 2009 is all too worrying. Perhaps many have worn liberty like a fashion accessory, or something only free-born Englishmen should be able to afford. How much easier it seems to demand free speech, a fair hearing and privacy for people \"like us\" than to extend asylum or protection from cruelty to a stranger. Liberty is not a cocktail party for the converted. Its strength comes from values applied day to day with a long memory and an even hand.\nNever were our values more crystallised than after the second world war when visionaries of all faiths and none settled on democracy's core essentials. Just as untempered markets eat themselves, majority power will descend into tyranny without the rule of law and a bundle of non-negotiable rights. Eleanor Roosevelt called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a \"Magna Carta for the world\", acknowledging an aspiration that the oldest unbroken democracy might inspire and associate with a freedom narrative of global reach.\nMy memory may be shorter than that of the great organisation I serve, but I remember that we had fewer friends the day after 9/11 than seems the case today. Last week's European court of human rights ruling - upholding the law lords' historic \"Belmarsh\" decision - was a timely reminder of those dark days. Still the government attempts to prevent the high court exposing complicity in the torture of Binyam Mohamed. Still it requests that parliament renew the odious control order legislation so that suspects remain under indefinite house arrest on the basis of secret intelligence.\nAfter the twin towers atrocity, many were prepared to look the other way as Britain and its closest ally corrupted their best traditions. Years of detention without trial, even kidnap and torture, were excused because those dehumanised were \"foreigners\". This must be remembered when the salesmen come calling with their carpet bags of \"British\" rather than \"human\" rights. In a modern world of transnational and multinational power, we must decide if we are all \"people\" or all \"foreigners\" now.\nWhen governments told us \"nothing to hide; nothing to fear\", who would have thought that summary extradition would bite white-collar traders and awkward hackers as well as dark-skinned terror suspects? Who would have imagined that peace protesters would be arrested for reading out the names of the dead of Iraq; or that the retired senior law lord would, in these pages, describe the British as \"the most spied upon people in the democratic world\"?\nEach episode has brought new friends, as did our campaign last year against 42-day pre-charge detention.

Behind it is Murray Moss, former partner of Ronaldus Shamask, and his co-designer, Timothy Di Salvo. For their first collaboration, they stuck to classic sporty styling for long blazers and buttoned-up cardigan jackets in solids and plaids. These topped slim pants, shorts, very short straight skirts and wrapped tulip skirts.\nAnother partnership, Trinder & Boylan, consists of Marsia Trinder and Nuala Boylan, who take classics to a new level. A baseball jacket, for example, is done in black and white houndstooth checks reversing to red quilted silk. Overalls show up in brown hammered velvet over a black organza polo shirt.

He will remain at the Morris County Correctional Facility until his detention hearing on Wednesday. At the hearing, it will be decided if he is allowed his freedom during the lead-up to his trial.\nThe Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office will likely file more charges against Muldrow to account for the seriously injured, Matthew Troiano, the chief assistant prosecutor, said during the proceedings. But he declined to comment further.\nMatthew Reisig, the Freehold attorney representing Muldrow, declined to comment until after that hearing.\nMuldrow drove one of three buses that left East Brook Middle School last Thursday, bound for Waterloo Villiage. But the buses missed their exit, and each driver tried to make their own way, court documents said.\nMuldrow, who was ferrying 38 students and six teachers, drove back to Route 80 and allegedly swung across three lanes of traffic in an apparent attempt to reach the official-use-only turnaround in the center of the highway. Court documents said his bus was \u201cpositioned in an almost-perpendicular direction in relation to the lanes of travel on Route 80 Westbound\u201d when it was hit by the dump truck, which was driving in the center lane.\nThe fearsome impact wrenched the bus from its chassis, which came to rest across the highway.

But the driver still believed he hadn't done anything wrong.\nMuldrow looked \"very broken,\" Clark said.\nThe Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office remained determinedly tight-lipped last week about its investigation.

Over the course of a 32-week-long study, participants who added dessert to their breakfast - cookies, cake, or chocolate - lost an average of 40 pounds more than a group that avoided such foods, the journal Steroids reports.\nWhat\u2019s more, they kept off the pounds longer.

He was 95.\nThe Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, where Dr. Carlsson had served on the faculty since 1959, confirmed the death but did not give a cause.\nDr. Carlsson shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Paul Greengard and Eric R. Kandel, scientists who independently studied the molecular underpinnings of the brain, in particular the ways neural signals affect memory, mood and movement.\nTheir research helped resolve a debate over whether signals in the brain were transmitted mainly through electricity, as was previously believed, or through chemicals known as neurotransmitters.\nBeginning in the 1950s, Dr. Carlsson focused primarily on dopamine, which most of his contemporaries believed was an unimportant precursor to norepinephrine \u2014 a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating a person\u2019s heart rate and alertness.\nThrough experiments that began in the United States at the National Institutes of Health and continued in Sweden, Dr. Carlsson showed that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in its own right. Concentrated in a region of the brain known as the basal ganglia, it affects a person\u2019s ability to wave their arms, run across a stage or otherwise move their body.\nIn one major study, Dr. Carlsson administered an antipsychotic drug to rabbits, reducing dopamine levels in their brains. The rabbits were all but crippled and displayed similar symptoms to those of a Parkinson\u2019s patient.\nDr. Carlsson was also cited by the Nobel committee for contributing \u201cstrongly\u201d to the development of a popular new class of antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In effect, the drugs increase the concentration of serotonin, another neurotransmitter that fascinated Dr. Carlsson.\nAccording to the medical historian Edward Shorter, Dr. Carlsson \u201cdeveloped the first SSRI\u201d while working as a consultant for the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra, now AstraZeneca. The drug was ultimately withdrawn from the market over clinical concerns, much to Dr. Carlsson\u2019s disappointment, but was credited with paving the way for Prozac, one of the world\u2019s most commonly prescribed medications.\nThe third of four children, Arvid Carlsson was born in Uppsala, Sweden, on Jan. 25, 1923. The family moved to the university town of Lund after his father, a historian, was offered a teaching post; his mother focused on raising the children but later became a noted scholar of women\u2019s legal status in the Middle Ages.\nIn part to separate himself from his humanities-oriented family, Dr. Carlsson decided to study medicine and pharmacology, and enrolled at the University of Lund two years after the outbreak of World War II.\nHe had just begun his clinical training when, in the spring of 1944, about 30,000 prisoners from Nazi concentration camps were transported to Sweden. Dr. Carlsson was part of a group of physicians and medical students who treated them for tuberculosis and malnutrition.\nAfter Dr. Carlsson completed his doctoral thesis in 1951, a scholarly committee told him its subject \u2014 calcium metabolism \u2014 wasn\u2019t particularly pharmacological"}

And I was curious what he meant about \"What Newton Never Knew\". I was not sure if he planned to go into relativity or even into quantum gravity.\nInstead, he mostly told us all of the amazing things that Newton did know. Due to his own discoveries as well as those of his predecessors and contemporaries such as Galileo and Kepler.\nFreedman talked of Millennium lists of top people. Newton was in the top five on all the lists!\nNewton appeared on a postage stamp and on the One Pound Note in England when there was such a thing.\nFreedman handed out an iClicker device to allow audience members to register their answers to various physics questions. It was a valuable window into whether people were following along and whether they were learning from his talk.\nFreedman actually wanted people to discuss their answers with their neighbors before responding!\nThe first question: A force is a push or a pull. If an object moves in a circle at a constant speed, which of these forces must act on it?\nMost of our group answered E that you need all of the forces. The correct answer is A.\nHSSB President Roger Schleuter insisted that a force was needed to keep the object moving forward (as in C) because of friction through the air or water.\nFreedman invited us to think about planets and other bodies in space where friction would be minimal. In space there are no strings attached. Just gravitation. And Newton's great insight was that the gravity that made an apple fall is the same gravity that keeps the moon falling toward the Earth. \"Universal gravitation.\"\nYou are even attracted gravitationally to the person sitting next to you. Note to astrologers: That force is actually larger than the force of any other planet on you.\nOur group answered A, B and C in equal numbers.\nThe correct answer is C. This is not specific to gravity. If you are sitting in a seat, the chair pushes up on you exactly as hard as you are pushing down on the seat. Otherwise you would be rising or falling. This is Newton's law that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\nThe Moon doesn't exactly orbit the Earth. The Earth and the Moon actually orbit each other around a common center of mass. That common center is about 1700km below the Earth's surface. It makes the Earth wobble.\nNote that the larger the orbit size of an orbiting body, the slower the speed. Mercury is close to the sun and orbits at 48km/sec. Neptune is the furthest planet and orbits at 5km/sec.\nFreedman did a demonstration of a ball swinging on a string to show the same principle.\nIf a planet moves in a circular orbit around the Sun at a constant speed, which of these forces must act on it?\nNote that this is really the same question as before, but applied to planets. Most who voted got it right! They learned!\nThat very morning was a launch from Vandenberg that placed a satellite in orbit. Newton's laws work!\nBut Newton's laws can only be calculated from equations for two bodies. For three or more bodies it is necessary to resort to computer simulations.\nQuestion: Which statement about the rings of Saturn is correct?\nHalf our group said B; the other half said E. The correct answer is B. Saturn's rings are made of particles.\nThe F ring of Saturn was discovered in"}

Warren's brand relies on her popularity with liberals who believe the Democratic Party of Obama, Clinton, and another Senate leader, Charles Schumer of New York, is no less a patron of Wall Street than is the GOP. Two years after her election in Massachusetts, Warren is not nearly the nuisance to leadership that Senator Ted Cruz has been for Republicans, but she is known for speaking\u2014and voting\u2014her mind. Whether her appointment as a \"strategic policy advisor\" to the Democratic leadership changes that approach or not will be closely-watched in the coming months.\nFor her part, Warren betrayed no hint of hesitation in joining Reid's team. \"I believe in what the Democrats are fighting for,\" she told reporters. \"Wall Street is doing well, CEOs are bringing in millions more, and families all across this country are struggling. We have to make this government work for the American people, and that\u2019s what we are here to fight for.\" In a separate email to her supporters, she said her ascension would mean \"a seat at the table for all of us.\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who was reelected on Thursday to serve as party chief in the minority of the next session, anticipated that question as he introduced Warren to a throng of reporters in the Capitol after a soul-searching caucus meeting that lasted nearly four hours. \"What do you expect her to do?\" Reid asked, repeating a question he said was shouted at him earlier in the day. \"I expect her to be Elizabeth Warren.\"\nFor the moment, Warren's progressive fans are ecstatic over her promotion, symbolic or not. \"There's really not much of a downside. We're pretty psyched,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which led a Draft Warren for Senate effort in 2012.

It'll be closer to a billion that half a billion.\"\nMeanwhile, last week, speaking from their headquarters, several major car marketers vowed to move ad dollars elsewhere if national broadcast networks seek double-digit rate hikes in the upcoming upfront. Some automotive marketing executives said they plan to decrease upfront spending no matter what happens as they strive for a more targeted reach.\nThe upfront refers to the freewheeling auction that takes place each spring as the TV broadcast networks try to sell between 75% and 80% of their commercial airtime ahead (or \"upfront\") of the new fall TV season.\nIn defending the broadcast networks at the summit, Jon Nesvig, president of sales at News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting, pointed to a study by the Association of National Advertisers that reported marketers' overall advertising budgets are up. In the survey, released in March, 37% of marketers said they would spend more on TV this year, 45% would spend the same and 18% would spend less.\n\"Broadcast TV may take a hit, it might not,\" Mr. Nesvig said.

It's a tough one when he pitched his heart out.\"\nComing off a four-hit shutout of Washington in his previous start, Cain was equally miserly in the first five innings Tuesday. The 5.4-magnitude quake that rocked Southern California at 11:42 a.m. seemed to shake all the power out of the bats in both dugouts.\nThe calm of a 0-0 game was shattered in the fourth inning when James Loney hit a shot off Cain's right ankle that ricocheted into the air and landed near the Giants' dugout. But the big horse was OK ... better than OK. He immediately struck out Casey Blake and Angel Berroa.\nCain used his curveball to great effect all night, but it also proved his undoing in the sixth inning. He threw a two-strike, two-out hanger to Loney, who drove it into left field for a single that broke the scoreless tie. Cain was livid with himself, jerking his body in anger as Matt Kemp trotted home from third.\nThe inning appeared to end when Blake doubled down the left-field line and Loney was thrown out at home. But when Fred Lewis initially bobbled the ball, he created a chaos he hardly could have imagined.\nThe ball popped off his hands and bounced onto the padding atop the short fence in foul territory. Lewis retrieved it and threw to Omar Vizquel, who threw home - but the umpires ruled the ball crossed the plane into the stands before Lewis grabbed it.\n\"The ruling on the field was that the ball left the top of the padding and went into the stands,\" crew chief Greg Gibson said. \"Once it's in the stands, it's dead, and both runners advance two bases.\"\nNot only was Loney not out, he was awarded home plate, giving the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.\nBochy argued the ball did not cross into the stands, but Vizquel backed the umpires' version.\n\"It looked like it went over and Fred grabbed it on the other side,\" said Vizquel, adding, \"I've never seen that play happen before, not even in the highlights.\"\nComing from a guy who has played"}

In extending our studies from worms to mammals, questions take on added dimensions due to the presence of tissue regeneration in mammals. In mammals, we are interested in two questions. First, do the mechanisms that regulate invertebrate aging also affect aging of higher species in an evolutionarily conserved manner? Second, do these mechanisms regulate changes in tissue regenerative capacity during aging, or the ability of stem cells to persist throughout life?\nWe have explored the importance of FOXO3 in mammalian regenerative cells, focusing on adult neural stem cells (NSCs). In the adult brain, NSCs can produce new neurons that are involved in certain forms of learning and memory and in repair after injury. However, NSC regenerative potential declines with age. We found that FOXO3 deficient mice displayed premature depletion of NSCs (Renault et al., 2009). Genome-wide identification of FOXO3 target genes in NSCs revealed that FOXO3 preserves NSCs by increasing cellular quality control and restraining premature neurogenesis (Renault et al., 2009; Webb et al., 2013). We have extended these studies to other FOXO family members and their regulators in the brain. By generating mice deficient for FOXO6, the FOXO isoform enriched in mature neurons, we found that FOXO6 deficiency results in defective retrieval of memories and altered expression of synaptic plasticity genes (Salih et al., 2012). We have also showed that SIRT1 \u2013 a FOXO (and other protein) deacetylase \u2013 is important for the generation of oligodendrocytes from NSCs (Rafalski et al., 2013). Together, these findings provide insights into how nutrient-sensing pathways impact adult stem cells and their progeny \u2013 a key step in harnessing the regenerative potential of stem cells and in preventing age-dependent decline in brain function.\nWe are interested in testing how chromatin modifiers that affect invertebrate lifespan act in mammalian adult stem cells. We have started to probe the importance of epigenetic modifications by conducting a meta-analysis of a large number (>200) of H3K4me3 genomic datasets in a range of cell and tissue types (Benayoun, Pollina, Ucar et al., 2014). We found that H3K4me3 is not just present at promoters, but can spread more broadly over genes. The broadest H3K4me3 domains in a particular cell type are associated with genes that are critical for that cell type, and we have indeed used broad H3K4me3 domains as a discovery tools to identify novel regulators of NSCs. Interestingly, broad H3K4me3 domains are associated with genes whose transcription is more consistent. Deficiency in H3K4me3 modifiers in NSCs leads to increased transcriptional variability. Thus, the breadth of H3K4me3 contains important information for transcriptional precision, which could have important consequences for cell function.\nWe are currently exploring whether aging is associated with remodeling of broad H3K4me3 domains. Given the link between H3K4me3 breadth and transcriptional consistency, we are particularly intrigued in studying transcriptional variability during aging. Importantly, we want to"}

But with corporate earnings still playing truant, there are rising concerns about stiff valuations and the possibility of a market correction.\nFor those seeking relatively safe bets now, a large-cap fund with a sound, long-term track record seems a good choice. Generally, large-cap funds can weather market weakness better than mid and small-cap funds, while also participating well in upsides.\nSBI Blue Chip, more than a decade old, is among the good choices in the large-cap category. With annualised returns of about 14 per cent over three years and 20 per cent over five years, it has beaten the benchmark S&P BSE 100 comfortably \u2014 by about 6 percentage points. The long-term winning consistency is also quite high; on a one-year daily rolling return basis, the fund has done better than the benchmark almost 85 per cent of the time in the past five years.\nThe track record would have been better but for the dip in performance in the past year. SBI Blue Chip\u2019s 16 per cent return last year is lower than the benchmark\u2019s 17 per cent return and is also lesser than the category average.\nThis is due to the fund being underweight on financial and metal stocks which have had a good run, and overweight on the beleaguered pharma sector.\nThe fund has, in recent times, added to exposure in financials and metals while trimming exposure to pharma stocks; this should aid performance. Despite the short-term underperformance, SBI Blue Chip\u2019s robust record places it in the top quartile among peers in the long term, ahead of peers such as DSP BlackRock Focus 25 and ICICI Prudential Focused Bluechip.\nThe fund invests largely (about 80 per cent of the corpus) in large-cap stocks and also takes mid-cap exposure of up to 20 per cent of the portfolio to give a kicker to returns.\nOver the past year and half, though, the mid-cap exposure has been pared considerably \u2014 from about 18 per cent of the corpus in December 2015 to about 11 per cent in December 2016 and to just about 7 per cent in August 2017.

Keep Its Top Talent?\nOver the past few years, many of Google &apos;s top employees have left for other companies. \"Brain drain\" isn&apos;t anything new in Silicon Valley, where companies regularly poach the brightest stars in the business, but Google&apos;s high-profile departures highlight some of its glaring weaknesses.\nThe ones who got awayMarissa Mayer, Google&apos;s first female engineer, worked at the company from 1999 to 2012. Mayer was the VP of Google product search until the end of 2010, when she was demoted by former CEO Eric Schmidt to lead the company&apos;s local, maps, and location services division. In 2012, she abruptly quit and became the CEO of Yahoo.\nThe following year, Android VP Hugo Barra left Google, reportedly due to a personal conflict with founder Sergey Brin. Barra then became the international of VP of rising Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, the most valuable start-up in the world.\nMore departures followed last year. Google+ chief Vic Gundotra, the man who was supposed to help Google \"get\" social, abruptly left the company. Nikesh Arora, Google&apos;s chief business officer, also left to head SoftBank&apos;s Internet and Media business. In October, Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, resigned to create an incubator for hardware start-ups. A month later, Tom Fallows, the head of product search and delivery service Google Express, left to work at Uber.\nThis year has been just as rough for Google. In February, Google&apos;s SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace retired. In May, Google PR boss Rachel Whetstone left to head PR operations at Uber, and Google&apos;s VP of shopping and travel Sameer Samat was lured away by fitness tracker maker Jawbone.\nMost of those departing executives worked on three particular businesses: product searches, Android, and social networking. The loss of top talent in those challenging areas could spell big trouble for Google. Here&apos;s why.\nSigns of troubleGoogle has constantly struggled to match Amazon in product searches. Last year, Eric Schmidt admitted that \"almost a third\" of product searches started on Amazon -- that&apos;s \"more than twice\" the number that started on Google. Consumers starting those searches on Amazon, other retail sites, or native shopping apps is bad news for Google, because it diminishes the value of its own search-based product ads. Google&apos;s defenses against Amazon -- Google Shopping, Google Express, and upcoming Buy buttons -- have been off to a sluggish start.\nMeanwhile, Android is the world&apos;s most popular mobile OS, but it&apos;s also a fragmented mess. By Google&apos;s own estimates, less than 10% of Android devices have upgraded to the newest version, Lollipop, making it tough to roll out new features for all users. Google&apos;s aggressive bundling of first party apps has also fueled an \"anti-Google\" Android movement known as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which encourages the distribution of \"forked\" versions of Android that aren&apos;t dependent on Google services. According to ABI Research, forked devices accounted for 29% of all Android devices worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGoogle also repeatedly failed at social networking with flops like Orkut"}

And so what was to be a churning mixture of musical hybridization became instead a pure stream of Cuban \"son\" - a music that is to salsa what blues is to rock-and-roll.\nThe result is \"The Buena Vista Social Club\" - an intricate, delicate collection of acoustic music just released in the states on Nonesuch / World Circuits, and named for an informal club of musicians in Havana's Buena Vista neighborhood in the 1920s.\nThe album includes some of the giants of \"son\" - guitarists Compay Segundo and Eliades Ochoa, pianist Ruben Gonzalez and singer Ibrahim Ferrer - most of whom made their names well before the Cuban revolution, but who are virtually unknown in the United States.\nWhen the West Africans didn't show, Cooder says, \"I had a list of musicians to call. You have old records, but you don't know who's living, who's dead, who can play, who can't. Ruben Gonzalez, first they said he'd died. Then he's not dead, he's got arthritis and can't play. I said, \"Bring him right down here, and we'll see.' In about four days time, he began to limber up.\"\nAs the sessions went on, a song list unfolded.\n\"Everything is very organic in Cuba,\" Cooder says.\n\"Musicians understand each other. And if you say to someone like Ibrahim Ferrer, \"You know 5,000 boleros - what's your favorite song?' It's a good way of cutting through everything. Ruben would just sit and play. I'd keep a recorder going. Then I would listen back and say, \"OK, 20 minutes ago, what's this?' \"\n\"It just so happens that in Cuba these guys know millions of great songs. Also, you have somebody like Compay Segundo to ask. It's like asking the Oracle. His own repertoire is fantastic: \"My word, the seal of quality,' he says, which is the truth.

She also toured facilities operated by Norway\u2019s Statoil, which has invested more than $4 billion in the region.\nIt was Jewell\u2019s first visit to the surging oil region since she became Interior secretary in April.\n\u201cTo see that on the ground is amazing,\u201d Jewell added.\nDespite the flurry of activity \u2014 which has turned Williston, N.D., into a modern-day boomtown \u2014 Jewell said oil and gas infrastructure hasn\u2019t taken over the area. By drawing on horizontal drilling techniques, oil companies are able to drill lateral wells that stretch far beyond the well pad.\nOn Tuesday, Jewell was joined by North Dakota Lt. Gov. Drew Wrigley and the state\u2019s two senators, Republican John Hoeven and Democrat Heidi Heitkamp.\nStatoil workers highlighted a pilot project to capture natural gas as a compressed liquid and then put it to use fueling rigs and other equipment, effectively slashing the use of diesel in the oilfield. The company also is working on gas lift projects, where natural gas is pumped back into wells to aid overall production.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that these guys are working to try and address the carbon pollution issue and the methane release,\u201d Jewell said.\nSuch innovations may be key for oil companies to find beneficial and commercial uses for the natural gas they bring up along with the crude, instead of burning off the hydrocarbon. Companies with wells far from gas pipelines and gathering stations \u2014 a frequent problem in North Dakota and other areas where oil developments have taken off \u2014 sometimes resort to such flaring the fossil fuel.\nConservationists say natural gas flaring and venting hurts the environment, while depriving taxpayers of revenue that would be tied to selling the fossil fuel. Although methane does not remain in the atmosphere as long as other greenhouse gases, it is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to warming the atmosphere.\nA government-backed study published Monday said nearly a tenth of methane produced from oil and gas operations in Utah\u2019s Uintah Basin escapes into the atmosphere.\nThe Obama administration is taking aim at the practice. As part of a plan for combating climate change unveiled in June, President Barack Obama pledged to pare methane emissions tied to natural gas, both at the wellhead and when the fossil fuel is transmitted.\nObama directed executive agencies to develop a comprehensive strategy for tackling methane emissions, including support for efforts to build and upgrade gas pipelines.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep working with the industry to make drilling safer and cleaner, to make sure that we\u2019re not seeing methane emissions and to put people to work modernizing our natural gas infrastructure so that we can power more homes and businesses with cleaner energy,\u201d Obama said at the time.\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz told reporters last week that despite the problem of fugitive emissions, natural gas has a big climate advantage over dirtier burning coal.\nThe Energy Department, Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency also play a role on the issue.

While members from both sides of the aisle are struggling to find common ground, a compromise is yet to be reached.\nWith Congress fighting for a compromise, down to every last penny, the fate of government programs such as Social Security and healthcare remains in the hands of a few powerful congressmen. But does the government actually spend where Americans want to see money being spent? We decided to roam the streets of Washington to find out whether Congress really has the best interests of the American taxpayers at heart.\nInstead of simply carrying out a series of one-on-one interviews, RT conducted an experiment to get to the bottom of this issue. We laid out six jars to represent six different areas where the government spends \u2014 education, infrastructure, Social Security, healthcare, deficit reduction and the military. We gave our interviewees five pennies and asked them to divide their fortunes between the six jars, forcing them to make a cut somewhere.\nBy far the two most popular programs were education and infrastructure. We interviewed people from all walks of life \u2014 young and old, Republicans and Democrats, men and women. Everyone chose to give at least one penny, and in many cases two, to education. Coming in a close second was infrastructure, as many complained about crumbling bridges and roads across the nation. Social security and healthcare each received a moderate amount of pennies towards the end of the interviews. Before we began this process, we all thought that deficit reduction would receive a large majority of the pennies, especially as the debt crisis has attracted nationwide attention. However, deficit reduction came in next to last. The most striking revelation of all was that the military came in last place. The military, where the federal government spends the most money, was the last place where Americans wanted to see their money being spent. Perhaps Washington isn\u2019t so in tune with what Americans want after all.\nWith five days left until the US hits its debt ceiling deadline, politicians are still divided on whether or not the country\u2019s borrowing limit should be raised. Euro Pacific Capital President Peter Schiff says that the debt ceiling isn\u2019t the real problem \u2014 it\u2019s the debt itself.\nRaising the ceiling, says Schiff, will only make that problem bigger. He says that the discussion over whether or not it should be raised is a charade, and right now the decision is up to us. \u201cIf we want to default, obviously we can do it. If we don\u2019t want to, there is plenty of revenue.\u201d Schiff believes that the government brings in enough money that it shouldn\u2019t have to worry about raising the ceiling, and is personally against it.\nSchiff adds that, if the US wants to keep the crisis from worsening, they need to stop borrowing and learn to deal with reality. Unfortunately, that reality, says Schiff, is that the government isn\u2019t helping us out. He says that too many impoverished Americans are in that state because the government is draining valuable resources out of the private sector.\nAnd according to Schiff, if the US continues to operate the way it has been, the economy will simply overdose."}

{"idx": "17460", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In the forthcoming testimony of Lt. Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, a likely main story line has already emerged: Iraq\u2019s military situation is improved, but its national political situation is not. Together these dueling realities make it hard to give up on the surge in one sense, yet hard to know how long we should keep risking young American GIs when Iraqi top leaders dither and quarrel in another.\nAt a more detailed military level, another theme seems likely to be discussed by Gen. Petraeus and Mr. Crocker \u2014 the distinction between different types of violence in Iraq. Some forms have declined more than others. While all are clearly important, it will be important to understand if some are more significant lead indicators of an improving security environment. That in turn will help us decide if the military progress is only modest or quite substantial.\nPerhaps the key pairing of violence metrics in Iraq will be total civilian fatalities, on the one hand and fatalities from reprisal killings on the other. The first category are, of course, victims of car bombings. The second is primarily a function of the responses of militias and gangs to those car bombings, as well as of other types of targeted revenge killings. This type of violence is often labeled under the heading of \u201cEJKs,\u201d or extrajudicial killings.\nHowever, it is the distinction of total fatalities versus EJKs that will likely get the most discussion this month. The reason is that car and truck bombings, like the terrible Aug. 14 bursts in northern Iraq that killed some 500 Iraqi innocents, are to some extent not indicative of the overall situation in Iraq. Of course, the more dependable Iraqi security forces at checkpoints, the more vehicle bombs will be stopped before detonating, and the more crack Iraqi special forces we can help train, the more successful raids we can conduct against car and truck bomb factories.\nIn addition, the intelligence information needed to counter vehicle bomb networks often comes from Iraqi citizens, and the more of them who want to help combined U.S.-Iraqi security forces, the better this information will be. Finally, as some 80 percent of suicide bombers in Iraq are believed to be foreigners, better border security will also at least somewhat dampen car and truck bombings. So broad security trends do of course influence the statistics.\nIndeed, for all these reasons the rate of major vehicle bombings in Iraq is down perhaps a third over the course of 2007. But there is still a capriciousness that means single events can radically alter trajectories about the frequency and lethality of attacks. One day of bad luck like Aug. 14, one day when bombers find a prime target not protected enough, and trendlines can change overnight.\nBy contrast, EJKs are to some extent a reflection of the broader state of sectarian violence, less prone to aberration from single events. In 2006, after the first Samarra mosque bombing, they went way up as Shia militias took the gloves off after decades of Sunni Ba\u2019athist oppression and nearly three years of Sunni-dominated lawlessness and terror in post-Saddam Iraq. The ensuing civil war made it patently obvious that our earlier strategy was failing and led to wide-scale ethnic cleansing as well as the widespread use of government ministries by Shia extremists who became largely inseparable from many Shia politicians.\nThis year, it appears the EJK tolls have declined a great deal in Iraq, especially in Baghdad.

The best way through the noise and bias is to look at hard data.\nThe economy has been growing since June 2009, making this the third-longest economic expansion on record. However, it has also been the weakest economic expansion on record. That has not changed under President Trump.\nAverage annual real GDP growth in this nine-year expansion is 2.14%. GDP growth in 2017, the first year of the Trump administration, was 2.3%, slightly above the expansion average.\nMeanwhile, GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 was revised down to 2.0%, slightly below the expansion average.\nIn short, growth under Trump has been almost exactly what it was under Obama. It\u2019s true that the second quarter of 2018 looks stronger, at 4.1%. It\u2019s the highest reading since 3Q 2014. But we\u2019ve seen that movie before.\nEven during Obama\u2019s weak expansion we saw strong quarters including the first quarter of 2015, which was 3.2%, and the second quarter of 2015, which was almost 3%.\nThe problem is that these strong quarters soon faded; growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was only 0.5%, almost recession level. And the strong second quarter in 2018 may be the result of temporary factors arising from the Trump tax cuts. Those factors will soon fade and return growth to the same punk levels we\u2019ve seen for nine years.\nI just mentioned recession. Most investors are familiar with the conventional definition of an economic recession. It\u2019s defined as two consecutive quarters of declining GDP combined with rising unemployment and a few other technical factors.\nBut investors may not be as familiar with two other aspects of recession timing. The first is the exact body that makes the determination, and the second has to do with the timing of that body\u2019s announcements.\nThe group that \u201cofficially\u201d decides when the U.S. economy is in a recession is called the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, although there\u2019s nothing official about what they do.\nNBER is a private nonprofit think tank that receives substantial input from scholars at Harvard and MIT, but it is not a government agency. Their decisions on the start and finish of recessions are not technically \u201cofficial,\u201d but they are widely accepted by Washington, the Fed and Wall Street.\nLess well known is the fact that recessions are not called by NBER until well after they have begun. In this respect, NBER looks backward at the data rather than forward like a forecasting firm.\nOn occasion, the NBER might not identify the start date of a recession until nine months or a year after the recession began. By that method, the U.S. could be in a recession next month and we would not know about it until a year from now when the data were all in.\nBut analysts, myself included, have to look for signs of a recession wherever they can find them and not wait for NBER to make its determination.\nFor example, pending home sales have dropped five months in a row. That is not by itself a definitive sign of a recession, but it\u2019s certainly a worrying trend. Many other signs are appearing on the horizon also as the"}

The plan seems to be to expand the Government\u2019s capability to access communications data connected to e-mail and internet use, providing for \u201creal time\u201d monitoring of activity and requiring internet service providers to install new hardware to improve storage of information and facilitate Government access.\nBoth the Prime Minister and the Home Office blame advancing technology for gaps in the existing law on surveillance, which they argue make the detection and prevention of crime more difficult. It has been suggested that criminals are moving away from the use of mobile phones to Skype and other web-based forms of communication, and that current law has failed to keep up. The Deputy Prime Minister has accepted that the existing rules may need to be changed to \u201ckeep pace with technology\u201d.\nThe Home Secretary argues \u201cnew technology can also be abused by criminals, paedophiles and terrorists who want to cover their tracks and keep their communication secret\u201d.

{"idx": "17476", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition is prepping for launch on PS4, Xbox One and PC on October 28th, at the end of the month. Ahead of the remastered game's release, Bethesda published the system requirements for the game on PC... and they aren't too bad.\nPolygon picked up the news from over on the official Bethesda website where they announced that The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition has gone gold. That means that the gold master disc has been compiled with the game's finalized, certified code and they're shipping it off to the printing press for mass distribution. The site also breaks down what you'll need under the hood of your PC in order to run the remastered version of Skyrim effectively.\nYou can check out the minimum and recommended specs below.\nThe game boasts 4K textures and higher poly meshes and models for the characters and game world. The PS4 Pro version will also supposedly run at native 4K, although Bethesda was very coy about detailing the frame-rate.\nThe minimum specs likely won't allow you to run Skyrim's remastered edition at native 4K on PC, but 8GB of RAM isn't too bad and the i6-750 means most people with decent quad-cores will be able to get by. I'm almost convinced that if you only had 6GB of RAM and did some decent flushing and management you might even be able to get by with that for the game. And the reason I say that is because the GPU requirement is only a GTX 470, which is several generations old in terms of rendering output and is a six-year-old card.\nSo basically, anyone who has bought a new PC within the last six years will have no problems running the remastered version of Skyrim on PC.\nIt's interesting because the minimum specs for the remastered edition of the game requires a card that came out before the original Skyrim released back in 2011. Back then the recommended specs were a quad-core with 4GB of RAM and a GTX 260 or Radeon 4890. Due to adding things like god-rays, screen space ambient occlusion, dynamic depth of field (which is a basic post-processing effect that actually doesn't take up that much processing power), and new shaders for the water and snow (which actually do take up a lot of processing power) the specs had to double for the game.\nThe one thing that actually surprises me most is that the recommended specs for Skyrim's hard drive space is 12GB on PC while the required storage space on PS4 is 20GB in North America, 33GB in Europe, 17GB on the Xbox One in North America and 25GB for the Xbox One in Europe. It's weird but there's only a 3GB difference between the North American versions of Skyrim on PS4 and Xbox One, and so I'm curious if the PS4 Pro has different HDD requirements because a 3GB difference is not enough to encase the entire game world in 4K textures. That would likely only cover the ground and some foliage textures. And just for reference, 2K ground textures for Skyrim clock in at 1.8GB compressed.\nAnyway, if you're keen on getting the remastered special edition of the game on PC, you won't have to worry about having a mega-rig to"}

And Redmond seems perfectly fine with that.\nIn 2017, I argued that Microsoft's Windows operating system, as we have traditionally understood it, has an expiration date. And for the Redmond software giant to move forward, the \"death\" of Windows probably will happen sooner rather than later.\nI described various architectural changes to the operating system that were critical in order for it to modernize and to shed legacy components that were hampering its evolution, such as the Win32 subsystem that has been present since 1990 or so, as well as its affinity to the Intel x86 architecture and moving to low-power SoCs, such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon, which is based on an ARM architecture.\nSystems that run on Windows and use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, such as HP's Envy X2 2-in-1, are already shipping.\nThese are changes that Microsoft is actively working on as part of a long-planned transition toward a more modernized way of software development, which allows it to target as many platforms as possible.\nThis includes mobile devices that run on Google's Android and Apple's iOS, as well as IoT appliances that scale all the way from tiny microcontroller-based smart light switches to smart appliances, video streaming devices, smart TVs, and video game consoles.\nWhat Microsoft now recognizes as its target platforms for its software products and services is effectively everything, not just personal computers.\n\"Digital technology, pervasively, is getting embedded in every place: Every thing, every person, every walk of life is being fundamentally shaped by digital technology -- it is happening in our homes, our work, our places of entertainment... It's amazing to think of a world as a computer. I think that's the right metaphor for us as we go forward.\"\nNone of this should come as a shock, as Microsoft has been doing quite a bit of organizational shuffling to de-emphasize its Windows teams and put much more emphasis in higher-growth areas such as the cloud and AI.\nThis is not to say Windows is unimportant to Microsoft and as an overall technology. It continues to be a very important fixture of not just desktop but also server-based computing in the enterprise.\nEven with application modernization efforts that move away from APIs, such as Win32, and toward web services and standards, Windows remains very sticky in large companies due to many legacy desktop applications that will just not go away.\nThe continued importance of Windows as a server OS in enterprise data centers and in the public and private clouds for IaaS workloads means we will probably still be dealing with it for at least another 10 years, if not more, despite the adoption of application-centric technologies like containers, microservices, and SaaS.\nBut that is the enterprise and the public sector, which move much more slowly and have many dependencies that must be taken into consideration. Personal technology and the home is another matter altogether.\nIn the home, the usefulness of the personal computer -- which includes Apple's Mac systems -- is reaching its endgame. There exists an entirely new category of computing users who do not even own personal computers.\nWhile it is difficult to correlate, taking into consideration the declining sales and effectively flat growth of PCs along with the huge market saturation of the smartphone and their overall usage seems to indicate people not only do more on smartphones but may even be using them exclusively as their primary computing platform.\nRead also: What is Microsoft's And"}

Most are so-called \u201cmillennials\u201d ages 25 to 35. The bloggers \u2013 many of whom are also moms \u2013 work as contractors for Clever Girls.\nClever Girls got its start after its co-founders, including blogger and mom Stefania Pomponi, made an important discovery: Companies were having trouble rounding up the right bloggers to write about their products.\nClever Girls was born when Pomponi enlisted the help of Sammis and others to co-found the company and build its network.\nThe female-run company makes money by using a sales team to pitch advertising campaigns to companies. The Clever Girls network of bloggers and social media trend-setters takes it from there.\nThe bloggers write about everything from electronics and food to fashion and products for infants and children, Sammis said. Some bloggers create video reviews that they post online, while others stick to web-based writing and posts on Pinterest, Instagram and other social media.\nSammis stressed that Clever Girls\u2019 bloggers always disclose if they receive products or money for blogging or reviews.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to be able to pay a woman in the middle of the country who has this third-generation recipe for Cool Whip,\u201d Sammis said, adding that bloggers can post such recipes on Pinterest, for example. \u201cTo be able to have her share that and be compensated for that from the brand she already loves,\u201d makes (dollars and) sense.\nA few of Clever Girls\u2019 clients include General Mills, Tempur-Pedic, Fresh & Easy, Toyota, Tropicana, Duncan Hines and LeapFrog, which manufactures popular electronic educational children\u2019s toys.\nThe Clever Girls network came in handy when a company called Beaba debuted a new, high-end bottle warmer and wanted to have moms write about it, Sammis said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive topic,\u201d Sammis said, adding that it would be difficult for Beaba to ferret out pregnant and new mom bloggers on its own.\nClever Girls \u2014 which markets largely to women via its fleet of female bloggers \u2014 is also run by the women.

How easily can you hook up and use a dial-up modem for each PC? And what if you can't yet get broadband service but still want a residential gateway, including hardware-based routing and firewall protection? The D-Link DI-714 Wireless Broadband Router ($220 street) and the U.S. Robotics Broadband Router ($150) address these problems by adding analog modem support to the usual list of residential gateway features: a single RJ-45 for a WAN (cable or DSL modem) connection, a four-port 10/100 Ethernet switch, support for NAT and DHCP, internal firewalls, various security features, and Web browser configuration. The D-Link model adds an internal 802.11b wireless access point; the U.S. Robotics model has a printer port to use in conjunction with print server software to install on each network PC.\nWhat sets these two gateways apart is that each also includes a 9-pin serial port for attaching an external analog modem if broadband isn't available.\nInstalling the residential gateways was simple. Also, the D-Link start-up brochure is a model of completeness and clarity.\nThe two gateways worked fine with our multiple-technology and -brand test network, which used an SNET DSL modem for broadband and a new U.S. Robotics V.92 56K Faxmodem ($110 street) plugged into each gateway's serial port.\nThe D-Link model can have both the cable/DSL modem and the analog modem plugged in at the same time; both are configured from the same setup screen. If broadband service fails (we simulated this by pulling the power plug), the analog modem automatically dials your ISP. On our test, the unit worked perfectly. The U.S. Robotics model, however, can not accommodate both modem types at the same time. If your broadband service goes out, you have to unplug the WAN plug, plug in the analog modem, reconfigure the router software for dial-up access, and reboot the router. This works, but we prefer the automatic process.\nYou may not want to pay for a wired ISP dial-up account if you're already paying for broadband, but if staying connected is essential, these two broadband routers make having both a viable option."}

It was during these periods that he recorded a bunch of demos that eventually led to full-on releases for his side projects such as the Coattail Riders and the Birds of Satan.\nWith the Foo Fighters on hiatus after a lengthy tour in support of their last album, \u201cSonic Highways,\u201d and the surprise dropping of their free EP \u201cSaint Cecilia\u201d last November, Hawkins decided to challenge himself during the break. This time around he put out an EP of short songs under his own name, for the first time, dubbed \u201cK.O.T.A.,\u201d which is an acronym for \u201cKing of the (Jerks),\u201d the title of a song written for the EP that he eventually didn\u2019t have time to finish.\nThe effort, which came out Nov. 11, features Hawkins on vocals and has him playing nearly every instrument. However, he did tap the talents of Birds of Satan and Chevy Metal cover band partner Wiley Hodgden and Foo Fighters\u2019 Nate Mendel for some for some of the bass tracks, as well as Foo Fighters\u2019 Chris Shiflett for \u201cthe hard stuff\u201d on guitar.\nAs an artist, Hawkins\u2019 biggest influences are former Police drummer Stewart Copeland and Queen anchor Roger Taylor. He was attracted to the fact that not only are they both phenomenal players, but also contributed songwriting and sometimes vocals to their bands.\nHawkins said he remembered being that age and thinking what his parents were listening to was weak. Back then, he was running around in south Orange County with his childhood friend Jon Davison, a fellow Laguna Beach native and the current singer for rock band Yes.\nIt looks like the Foo Fighters hiatus won\u2019t continue for long as Hawkins confirms the guys have been chatting about getting back at it soon as it was announced that they\u2019d perform at the NOS Alive Festival in Portugal on July 7. The band also just launched a website, FooFightersPassport.com, which features a map of Europe and a clickable passport that has yet to be filled with dates."}
{"idx": "17483", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Criminals and employees are more likely to be stealing information from companies rather than physical devices, according to a report examining fraud trends.\nFor the first time, companies are reporting more electronic data theft than physical thefts, said London-based risk consultancy Kroll.\nKroll's \"Global Fraud Report,\" an annual report on international fraud trends released on Oct. 18, surveyed more than 800 senior executives worldwide and across a range of industries in July and August. The results in the 2010 study showed electronic and information theft at 27.3 percent of total fraud losses, compared with 27.2 percent for physical theft of cash, assets and inventory, Kroll said. Physical theft was the most widespread form of fraud by a considerable margin in previous Global Fraud Reports.\n\"Much more work is done electronically, and that creates new opportunities for fraud. It takes time for companies to catch up with that,\" said Tommy Helsby, Kroll chairman for Europe, Middle East and Africa, to Reuters.\nAccording to the report, fraudsters are not switching away from other forms of fraud. Instead, information theft grew significantly to overtake physical theft and other types. \"Information-rich industries\" were the most vulnerable. Financial services had by far the highest level of electronic theft, followed by professional services and then technology, media and telecoms, according to the survey.\nCriminals generally target physical assets because they are frequently simple to steal and have a tangible monetary value associated with them. The increasing prevalence of information technology means the same things apply to data, making it a lucrative target.\nPoorly defended systems are easy to exploit, whether it's by sophisticated hackers or disgruntled employees walking out with the company's sensitive data on a USB stick, the researchers said.\nBusinesses lost almost $1.7 million per billion dollars in sales worldwide compared with the $1.4 million per billion dollars reported in 2009.\nThe company's own employees were a threat, with fraud more often being an \"inside job,\" according to the survey results. Junior employees and senior management were the most likely perpetrators of fraud. Staff or agents were the most common perpetrators of fraud in every region except Latin America, where customers were the principal fraudsters, said the report.\nRespondents were more likely to say their companies were more vulnerable to information theft or attack than to other types, said the survey. This type of crime was regarded as the greatest weak spot for financial services and professional services firms.\nWorries over fraud, namely corruption, deterred almost half of the companies in the survey from expanding into some key markets, such as China and Latin America, the surveyed executives said. The most frequently named markets were China and Africa, with 11 percent of the responders each deciding not to expand there. Latin America was close behind, named by 10 percent.\nChina had the highest level of fraud, with nearly 98 percent of businesses affected, followed by Colombia with 94 percent and Brazil with 90 percent, according to the survey. While there have been many reports of other countries or state-linked companies stealing intellectual property from firms, Helsby said he could not say whether this was increasing or not.\nNorth American companies currently have a \"benign\" fraud environment, the survey found, reporting less fraud across all types except for information theft. Fraud in this area was 32 percent, according to the survey, exceeding the survey average of 27 percent. Phishing was the most frequently named form of attack in the survey.\nHowever, only 34 percent of North American respondents"}

The Performance Partnership Pilots, or P3, which launched in 2014 as an interagency federal grants program targeted to efforts to help the country's most vulnerable students, gives a window into the potential and pitfalls of a more experimental approach to education programs.\nBacked by the White House and led by the U.S. Department of Education, the P3 program is in its second round of competition this month. It allows local education groups to waive regulations and blend money across federal grants to test creative ways to serve the students who are most at risk of disengaging from school.\nThat kind of change has been slow, though. A newly released study by Patrick Lester, the director of the Social Innovation Research Center, found that only four of the nine pilots in the $7.1 million first round received permission to blend different federal funding streams, and most asked for only a couple of regulatory waivers to start their projects.\n\"This is an area of nervousness for all involved,\" Lester said. \"The feds and the local projects are still exploring what is allowed and what isn't under P3. I think the guardrails have been a significant roadblock to flexibility so far, but they may be able to work through that. Time will tell.\"\nAnn Gettys has run up against those roadblocks in Oklahoma City, where through the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, she coordinates a P3 project to streamline supports for foster students.\nThe pilot allows her to waive some spending and performance requirements and braid together money from several federal programs, such as AmeriCorps, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grants for youths, and Health and Human Services Department grants for students transitioning from foster care. But there's still a lot of red tape.\nThe pilot works with foster students at age 14 to set their education and career goals and start planning for the legal transitions they will need to make when they age out of foster care at age 18.\nBut the career-transition experts generally funded under the workforce grants are not legally allowed to work with anyone under age 16. And under banking rules and financial-reporting requirements, foster students often need a guardian to open bank accounts, approve work programs, and so on.\n\"There's little things like that that make it more difficult,\" Gettys said. \"They aren't insurmountable, but they are frustrating.\"\nThe Oklahoma pilot is trying to document those roadblocks to build evidence of the broader regulatory changes needed for at-risk students.\n\"There's always tension between flexibility and accountability,\" said Kathy Stack, the vice president for evidence and innovation at the John and Laura Arnold Foundation, who helped create P3 and other evidence-based policy initiatives as a deputy associate director at the federal Office of Management and Budget.\n\"There aren't a lot of incentives for people to get together and brainstorm,\" she said. \"In so many communities, those conversations just never happen\u2014or they happen between two agencies or three. \u2026 There are tons of myths about what limitations exist.\"\nDreama Gentry, the executive director of Berea College's Partners for Education Project and one of the coordinating partners for Kentucky's P3, agreed that many projects can get stymied by \"imagined barriers.\"\n\""}

But what exactly are you signing up for if you vote yes?\nThe full initiative text is almost 8,500 words. So we broke it down for you. If the question passes, here\u2019s what the legal marijuana landscape will look like in Massachusetts.\nAnybody 21 or older, just like alcohol.\nUsers would be able to keep up to 10 ounces of pot in their home, or have one ounce on them at a time. Marijuana could be purchased in bud form, but also as edibles, drinkables, oil and ointment products.\nWhen could they buy it?\nNot until 2018, most likely. The state would begin accepting applications from retailers in October 2017, but it would need to make a decision within 90 days. So the first legal, recreational pot sale could occur in January 2018. Massachusetts bureaucracies, however, have a history of dragging their heels, and some members of the state Senate have suggested they could tweak with the law if voters pass it.\nWhere could they buy it?\nMedical dispensaries would get the first shot at offering retail sales, and can apply for a license in October 2017. Other would-be sellers would have to wait until 2018.\nMarijuana retailers and other facilities, like testing and cultivating centers, would be allowed in every city or town, unless the community held a local referendum to ban them. Even restricting the number of pot retailers could trigger a townwide vote, depending on how restrictive officials want to be.\nNo facility could be located within 500 feet of a school. Cities and towns could set other location requirements and restrictions within their boundaries.\nYes. The law would allow for six home-grown plants for anyone over the age of 21, with a maximum of 12 plants per household.\nThat depends on the market. There are no set prices in the law, but expect to pay more than the normal sales tax for pot.\nAll recreational sales would carry the state\u2019s 6.25 percent sales tax, plus an excise tax of 3.75 percent. Additionally, cities and towns would be able to tack a tax of up to 2 percent on sales, meaning that overall taxes could reach 12 percent. Some critics have said the tax rates are too low for the state to benefit, while proponents of the measure caution that the costs need to be kept low enough to keep users from going back to the black market.\nMedical sales would remain untaxed.\nWhere could it be used?\nIn private, mostly \u2014 the law would restrict its use in any public space or anywhere tobacco smoking is banned. However, the law does include measures that could lead to the eventual opening of cannabis cafes, where pot can be used on-premises.\nEmployers could restrict its use in the workplace, and landlords could ban tenants from smoking marijuana (but not against otherwise consuming it via edibles or ointments).\nA three-member Cannabis Control Commission would be established under the treasurer\u2019s office, which also oversees alcohol.

{"idx": "17494", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Two of the most successful intelligence disinformation campaigns that survive today were put forth by British Intelligence and the Russian KGB during, and shortly after, World War II.\nDuring World War II, the British made a spectacular technological advancement in the form of early radar that allowed them to target German bombers flying toward England, particularly at night, when they were extraordinarily difficult to intercept. The radar was fabulously successful, and many new British fighter aces were baptized by fire through shooting down German bombers.\nNaturally, they wanted to hide this fact for as long as possible, so we can imagine the long meetings that took place to come up with a plan. One of the golden rules of disinformation is that the best lies are based on truth, a tenet often still used today.\nIn this case, they chose to lie using real information and settled on the fact that carrots are high in Vitamin A, which is a vitamin useful to eyesight. This was the true fact that was then stretched to substantiate the lie that British pilots had extraordinarily good night vision that allowed them to intercept and shoot down so many German bombers at night.\nA substantial propaganda campaign was undertaken to convince the British public of the truth of the false statement, in order to have German spies pick up the information and pass it back to the German military. No clear records are known that indicate if the disinformation campaign had any effect on the Germans, but it was so successful with the public that it benignly lives on to this day.\nThe USSR\u2019s KGB of days gone by had just as great, if not a greater, success, albeit less benign. Following World War II, when the atrocities of the Nazi regime came to light, it surfaced just how similar the governments of the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were to each other. This was both a problem for the USSR, which had just occupied much of Eastern Europe, but also distasteful, since the Nazi and USSR leftist dictatorships had been implacable enemies.\nAs part of the early Cold War efforts, the CIA jumped into the fray and mounted a large information campaign, pointing out the truth of the similarities. Jews who had survived the Holocaust under the Nazis or Jews who had survived the purges of the USSR\u2019s Joseph Stalin were integral to the information campaign. Note that this is correctly classified as a clandestine information campaign and not a propaganda campaign, since the information was in fact true.\nThis effort was destroyed by The New York Times, who made public the CIA backing. The source of the information was almost certainly the USSR, who may have leaked the information to The New York Times or passed it through some other means.\nAt the same time, the Soviet Union put a propaganda countermeasures campaign in place, painting the Nazi regime as a fascist \u201cconservative\u201d movement and, therefore, not a socialist movement at all. This not only survives as a widespread false concept today, but also, because of its success as propaganda, it has been built upon using a variation on the central theme.\nA quote often attributed to UK wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill (though probably not said by him) is: \u201cThe fascists of the future will be called anti-fascists.\u201d This has come to fruition, as a number of today\u2019s socialist movements have adopted many of the early Nazi tactics used in their rise to power.\nOne need look no further than today\u2019s Antifa (Anti-Fascist) organizations for a perfect example.\nJust like the \u201cbrown shirts\u201d used by Hitler to help him"}

His party has denied links to the neo-Nazi movement.\nAccording to the European Jewish Congress, approximately 15,000 Jews currently live in Austria \u2014 mostly in Vienna, the country\u2019s capital.\nThe role of president in Austria is largely ceremonial. Elections for the position are held every six years."}

I am voiceless, Chissano said, pointing at his throat. A UN official with him, Africa I Deputy Director Margaret Vogt, told the Press \"we can deal with that later.\"\nWhen the Council's President for July, Uganda's Ambassador Ruhakana Ruganda, came to read out an oral press statement by the Council, he was asked how Chissano briefed the Council if his voice was so weak. He was clear, Ruganda replied. Inner City Press asked Ruganda to respond to what another Council Ambassador told the Press earlier, that ending Chissano's mission sent the message that the military solution to the LRA is viewed as the only solution. Video here, from Minute 1:40.\nNo, Ruganda said, the military action of DRC and Uganda takes place alongside efforts to make Kony sign a peace agreement, \"to remind\" him of the need to sign. Inner City Press asked if it is true that Kony demands that the ICC and its chief prosecutor Moreno Ocampo come and explain what will happen on the ICC's warrant against him, before he considers signing.\nRuganda said that Kony would gave accountability mechanisms in Uganda. Inner City Press asked, Not the Hague? Ruganda repeated, in Uganda.\nAt Wednesday's UN noon briefing, Inner City Press asked UN spokesperson Michele Montas if Chissano's UN office in Kampala will close. Yes, Ms. Montas said, adding that Chissano had felt ill and couldn't speak at the stakeout. What about Egeland's critique -- does Chissano still have a role? Video here, from Minute 14:12.\nNot at this point, Mr. Montas said. Who in the UN if anyone is reaching out to Kony, Inner City Press asked. Why end the effort at this time?\nMs. Montas said the UN \"stopped what had become useless.\" If so, it would be a first.\nFootnote: one would have liked to ask Chissano about any relation between his stepping down on the LRA and accepting another mediation job, for SADC, regarding Madagascar, trying to convince persuade what on Honduras is called \"coup leader\" Rajoelina and his Prime Minister Albert Zafy to meet with deposed President Ravalomanana and with his predecessor, Didier Ratsiraka. It is worth comparing the UN's stance on Madagascar's coup with that it has adopted on Honduras. Watch this site."}

D\u2019Souza narrates the documentary, and begins describing his own life by drawing SOME parallel between his own experiences as an Indian-American immigrating to the United States, as a college student at Dartmouth College, moving on to become an editor at the conservative magazine Policy Review and then working for the Reagan administration, with that of the life events of Barack Obama.\nAs he gets into the narrative about Obama, D\u2019Souza points out the similarities between his life in India and Barack Obama\u2019s days growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia (and states that Obama\u2019s birth was noted in a Hawaiian newspaper.) Young Barack Obama was raised by his mother, Ann Dunham, and stepfather Lolo Soetoro, after his father, Barack Obama Sr. returned to Kenya.\nD\u2019Souza then travels to Kenya and interviews Obama\u2019s half-brother, George Obama, who lives a pretty minimal third world existence, overtly wondering why the President has done nothing to help him.\nContinuing with the biographical narrative, as Obama\u2019s parents\u2019 relationship became strained (Obama\u2019s mother and father Barack Obama Sr. divorced in 1964), Obama is sent to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and meets Frank Marshall Davis, who is described at a prominent radical and card-carrying Communist. Obama goes on to study at Columbia, where the film claims he is influenced by anti-colonialist professors and activists. His philosophical development and social views are highlighted in a visit to Kenya after the death of his father in a car accident when the young Obama was 21.\nThe film incorporates spoken words from Obama\u2019s audio book, Dreams from My Father.

{"idx": "17498", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In a filled-to-capacity Ramsey County courtroom Monday morning, the Minnesota Legislature and Gov. Mark Dayton laid the aftermath of their political dispute at the desk of District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann.\nThe question they asked, through their lawyers: Can a governor veto the appropriation for the Legislature as a way to return lawmakers to the bargaining table?\nDayton did just that last month. In signing a complete budget into law, he line-item vetoed the two-year, $130 million budget for the Legislature. In response, the Legislature sued the governor.\nMinnesota has never seen a case like the one Guthmann must decide.\n\u201cThere are no other cases out there, certainly not from Minnesota,\u201d said Dayton\u2019s attorney, former Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Sam Hanson.\nEarlier this year, New Mexico\u2019s Republican governor vetoed legislative funding and the Democratic Legislature went to court over it. The court kept out of deciding whether the veto was constitutional and the politicians eventually worked out their differences. Forty years ago, West Virginia had a case with some similarities \u2014 but exact circumstances and the laws there are quite different from Minnesota.\nThe unique case \u2014 as Kelley noted, no other Minnesota governor has singled out legislative budgets for veto despite having the power to do so in the last 141 years \u2014 prompted Guthmann to ask pointed questions that took both parties\u2019 positions to their logical extremes.\nCould governors veto funding for the Supreme Court because they didn\u2019t like a court opinion, the judge inquired. That would be \u201cunsavory,\u201d said Hanson, but constitutional as long as the courts have another avenue of funding.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t obliterate another branch of government,\u201d answered Kelley.\nThe two sides agree on the facts of the case.\nThe Legislature inserted a provision in one budget bill that would require Dayton to sign a tax bill if he wanted the state\u2019s Revenue Department to remain operational. Dayton called that a \u201cpoison pill\u201d \u2014 although Hanson acknowledged it is likely a constitutional poison pill \u2014 and signed the tax bill into law. At the same time, Dayton line-item vetoed two years of funding for the House and Senate. He left in place $35 million worth of funding for some nonpartisan legislative functions.\nThat\u2019s where the two sides diverge.\nThe Legislature claims that Dayton crossed the line in his action and his motivation for the action.\n\u201cIn our view, since the governor has essentially obliterated the Legislature for the next biennium, you don\u2019t need to go any further \u2026 this is improper, impermissible and most courts would say, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true,\u2019 \u201d Kelley said.\nBesides, Kelley said, Dayton didn\u2019t make the veto because he objected to the amount the Legislature allocated for itself. He made the veto because he wanted the Legislature to renegotiate provisions in the tax bill and other measures.\nDayton argued that the Constitution gives the governor unfettered ability to line-item veto spending items, no matter his reason for the veto. The Legislature can always go to the courts to plead for funding, Hanson said.\nCourts have three times \u2014 on the verge of a shutdown in 2001 and during the government shutdowns of 2005 and 2011 \u2014 ordered funding for core functions of government, despite the lack of budgets approved by the Legislature and the governor.

Working with a comfortable lead can do wonders for a pitcher's performance during a game.\nLast night against North Chelmsford, Ashland Post 77's Cato LaCroix didn't need his team to light up the scoreboard to have success. That came solely from his lights-out performance on the mound.\nThe Holliston High rising junior struck out six in a complete-game effort and retired the side in order in the final two innings to lead Ashland to a 4-2 win over their Zone 5 foes.\n\"For somebody so young, he really doesn't show it,\" said Ashland manager Dennis Baker about LaCroix. \"That's really par for the course for him this season. He's been by far our best player and he's someone our kids look to to pick everybody up.\"\nAshland (4-2), playing in its first game in nine days because of rainouts, recorded most of its offense in the fourth inning, getting three runs on two hits including a game-breaking Shawn Lamothe two-run double that gave Post 77 all the scoring it would need.\n\"We just felt like we needed to capitalize and give Cato another few runs,\" Lamothe said. \"We just needed to put it in play and we were all set.\"\nLaCroix, who was batting .750 coming into last night's game, was hit by a pitch to lead off the fourth and moved to second on an errant pickoff throw. A walk and a Tim Gazard single loaded the bases for Billy Hulme, who picked up an RBI by scoring LaCroix on a fielder's choice to make the score 2-1.\nAfter Chris Papadellis grounded out to move the runners to second and third with two outs, Lamothe cranked a fastball to center field for a double to give Post 77 its key offensive hit of the night.\n\"My fastball was working especially good and I was able to throw my curveball for strikes and get batters out,\" LaCroix said. \"I knew that (our scoring) would be enough and I felt good.\"\nAn Alex Cloutier RBI single gave Post 313 (1-4) its only lead of the day in the top of the first, but Ashland answered in the bottom half, getting a run on an Alex Anagnostaras RBI single that brought Lamothe home to knot the game at 1-1. North Chelmsford righty Mike Martell recovered to allow just one hit over the next two innings, but Ashland turned it back on in the fourth to put the game away.\n\"With Cato, it seems like a three- or two-run lead is a little bigger than that,\" Baker said. \"Shawn Lamothe's hit was huge.

Poe, a former felony court judge and a member of the House Tea Party Caucus, said that violates the Constitution.\nHe also warned he'd vote against the measure if it imposes caps on states that don't want them.\n\"I got problems with that,\" Poe said. \"I think it's a violation of the Tenth Amendment.\"\nArguments about the Constitution have a special resonance in this Congress.\nRepublicans had the House read the Constitution as one of their first actions upon winning a majority, and new House rules require lawmakers to provide justification in the Constitution for any bill they propose.\nDemocrats sparked the fight with an amendment from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) that would prevent Gingrey's bill from overriding state constitutions that forbid medical malpractice caps. The bill, however, allows states that already have caps in place to retain them.\nJohnson agreed to pull his amendment after Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tenn.) agreed to work with him after Wednesday's markup. The panel will resume consideration of the bill next week.\nJohnson and Rep. Mel Watts (D-N.C.) baited Republicans by taking them to task for criticizing healthcare reform as a federal intrusion while proposing legislation that overrides state constitutions.\n\"I think President Reagan would be appalled,\" Johnson said.\nAdded Watts: \"I thought it was the Republican members of our committee who believe in states' rights.\"\nSmith, who has made tort reform one of his top five priorities, defended the law, saying tort reform falls under the purview of the Constitution's Commerce Clause.\n\"If Alabama and New York want to be a haven for malpractice suits, it's great for Texas,\" said Rep.

We have to go nuclear, others say. We need to keep burning coal. We need more normal drilling. We need to use less oil. Growth is the answer. Growth is the problem.\n\"But there will be no magic bullet. We could destroy the things we love. Technology can be, but is not always, the answer. Ideas about nature matter.\"\nPerhaps the most resounding revelation in this 300-page tone poem to green energy is the devastating fact that a lot of the supposedly new green technology, like wind power and electric cars, have been around for well over a hundred years; some never caught steam, others found themselves crushed by fossil fuels.\n\"This book,\" Madrigal writes, \"is about the uncertainties and triumphs of innovation, the mysterious process by which ideas are made into products out there in the world. In a realm in which everyone argues that things must or will happen, the knowledge of our fallibility is what is most important.\"\nThe following is a portion of our conversation.\nHow did you initially become interested in the subject of green energy?\nI was reporting on the green venture capitalist boom in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2007 and it seemed like everyone was interesting in green energy. I think it was Bruce Sterling who called peak sexiness for \"green\" in that year. Seems to me he was right, but I was smitten nonetheless.\nAfter last year's BP debacle in the gulf and this year's tragedy in Japan, one would think cleaner, greener energy would be a more pressing issue than it is today. Ultimately, why is that?\nThese are hard, long problems. It's like peace in the Middle East with more thermodynamics thrown in. While the broad strokes -- reinventing society, igniting a new industrial revolution -- are fascinating, the details are about as interesting as your average mid-level utility board annual stockholder meeting.\nHow big of a role will innovative design play in the bigger picture of emerging and affordable renewable energy?\nDesign and urban planning are the wild-card levers in our energy system. We tend to think of science and engineering as solving energy problems, but the history tells us that the turn away from regionally appropriate architecture in mid-century America is a major reason that we have such an energy-intensive way of life relative to the rest of the world. We traded design for energy. Sometimes it was as simple as doing away with the idea of shade trees, which can reduce energy consumption in hot places. Now, we have the tools to model those kinds of tradeoffs and I hope that means that even the biggest tract home building developers start to replace ongoing energy costs with smart upfront design.\nThomas Perry's windmill testing apparatus.\nIn the book, I found pages of declarations that really got to the heart of why"}

The other homeless people had wandered off to sleep in alleys. Mitchell was shaking, having not eaten or shot heroin all day, facing another night alone on the concrete.\n\"How come my life is like this?\" she wailed, waving her bony arms. \"Nobody cares.\"\nShe was wrong. Today, two years and four months after that June night on the sidewalk, the 55-year-old Mitchell is clean of heroin, healthy, and has a safe place to live in downtown San Francisco. She is an example of how redemption can come for even the most desperate, with the help of a determined social worker given the resources to do the job.\nIt is expensive redemption -- Mitchell's home and medical care cost taxpayers about $21,000 a year. But her case shows how that can be far cheaper than allowing homeless people to deteriorate on the street, becoming public nuisances and financial burdens.\nIn her last two years on the street, the public spent nearly $100,000 annually on Georgia Mitchell's emergency care and support.\nA Chronicle reporter and photographer first met Mitchell in June 2003, at a point in her life when she spent her days selling scrounged clothing and toys on Market Street near United Nations Plaza. Usually clad in a turban and a dark dress clinging to her stringy frame, she wheeled a shopping cart full of blankets, a Bible and dolls. The $5 a day she earned went to her crack and heroin habits.\n\"Life's not too bad,\" she said one hot day that year in a near-whisper. \"My friends give me food. I smoke when I need to, get well (shoot heroin) when I have to.\"\nRaised poor in Hattiesburg, Miss., she met a man named Eddie Banks at age 17. They fell into a cycle of drug use and poverty that landed them in San Francisco. When Banks died in 1986 because of drug abuse, they had been together 17 years, and Mitchell knew little of any other life.\n\"After he died, I'd clean houses or be an in-home health aide, sometimes lived with my sister here in San Francisco, but then I guess I gave up,\" she said.\nThe sister, Lula, said she moved back to Mississippi in 1990. \"When her man died, she kind of died with him,\" she said by phone from Hattiesburg. \"I love her but haven't the slightest idea how Georgia stayed alive all these years.\"\nThere is not much in the public record to shed light on that question.\nIn 1994, according to Mitchell, she served four months in San Francisco County Jail for cocaine possession. Over the next nine years, she vaguely recalls being in hospitals, sometimes staying with friends, being on city welfare at some point for a couple of years.\nBy 2003, she was known on the street as \"Mama,\" though she has no children. Her days were a dreary routine of leaning against her cart, selling things and storing condoms, needles and crack for pals in exchange for drugs. Nights meant sleeping outside or in friends' hotel rooms.\nThat November, she smashed her right knee on a fire hydrant, and within weeks couldn't walk.

Do you splurge at the expense of your friend\u2019s pocketbook, or do you eat light, knowing you\u2019re going to end up paying for your friend\u2019s lavish meal?\nThis seemingly innocuous event has caused enough consternation that a group of three scientists actually performed field experiments to see how unscrupulous people really are.\nAccording to io9.com, the experiment went a little like this: A group of strangers gather to eat at a restaurant. The participants are each told how they will pay for their meal. Some will pay individually, some are told they will split the check, and the remaining people are told that the meal will be free.\nThe diners then ordered their meals without anyone else seeing what they had chosen.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, the people who paid individually were the most frugal, the people getting the free lunch were most extravagant, and the people who split the bill were in the middle, and therefore slightly unscrupulous.\nSome diners were then told that they would have to pay just one-sixth of the cost of their individual meal. There was no difference between what those diners ate compared to those who were told they had to split the bill evenly, according to io9.com.\nThe 1/6th diners paid just about what the split-pay people did. So it seems we just like a good cheap lunch, no matter who it\u2019s coming from.\nThe study, entitled \u201cThe Inefficiency of Splitting the Bill,\u201d also found that 80 percent of people would prefer to pay their individual bill rather than splitting it.\nMy husband and I went out to dinner one night with another couple and when it was time to pay the bill, the other couple told the waitress that we would just split it.

But the market is split on which company will benefit most.\nYesterday, Britivc issued its trading update for the year to September 30. The company was unable to say much about the proposed deal because of Takeover Panel rules, but the statement was in line with market expectations. The Panel\u2019s \u201cput up or shut up\u201d deadline for the deal is October 31.\nBritvic shares plunged in July after the company was forced to recall Robinsons Fruit Shoot and Fruit Shoot Hydro packs from the UK and France because of faulty packaging. Questor thought the fall was overdone and recommended a purchase at 260.7p. Yesterday\u2019s update show that, indeed, the sell off went too far.\nIn total, the costs associated with the product recall are still expected to be in the \u00a315m to \u00a325m range \u2013 but management were unable to tighten this range yesterday.\nOver the year, revenues slid by 0.8pc to \u00a31.26bn, with the fall primarily caused by the Fruit Shoot issue. Revenue growth was hit by about 2pc.\nIn the fourth quarter there was a mixed performance in the UK, where total revenues fell 4.3pc. The British carbonates business performed well, with revenues up 2.1pc. This is a good performance as sales in the period one year ago rose 8.4pc. The GB still drink business saw a 14.1pc fall in revenues and 14pc fall in volumes over the quarter, reflecting the recall.\nIn Ireland, fourth-quarter revenues fell 8.5pc, due to the performance of third-party brands, with full-year revenues down 9.6pc. But in France, higher prices helped quarterly revenues improved 13.3pc and 8pc over the year. International revenues, however, slid 13.6pc over the quarter and rose 0.7pc for the year.\nSo, given its recent problem, trading at Britvic isn\u2019t too bad.\nUnder the terms of the proposed merger, Britvic shareholders would own 63pc of the enlarged group, and AG Barr investors the remaining 37pc.\nAnalysts are split on which company the deal favours most. Some have argued that the deal favours Barr because it would own 37pc of the new group but produced just a quarter of combined earnings. Indeed, looking at consensus forecasts for 2014, Britvic\u2019s operating profit would make up 79pc of the enlarged group.\nOthers have argued that Barr\u2019s rate of growth is better and the company was rated on higher multiples by the market. Barr\u2019s 2013 price earning multiple is 19.9 compared with Britvic\u2019s lower 11.3.\nSome analysts have even suggested that Britvic\u2019s dividend could be at risk should the merger not take place. The concern is that cash conversion has been poor.\nLooking at the share price performance since the day before the talks were announced, Britvic shares have slightly outperformed, rising 8.6pc compared with 8pc for Barr.\nThere will undoubtedly"}

{"idx": "17534", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Cycling provides an excellent form of exercise, but the vigorous and repetitive nature of the movements may lead to cramping of the leg muscles such as the hamstrings, calves or quadriceps. According to the Mayo Clinic website, this painful phenomenon can also be a result of dehydration and excessive heat, or a combination of the two. Although this is a benign condition, muscle cramps require cyclists to either slow down or stop riding to manage the temporary symptoms. Incorporate various techniques into your exercise routine to minimize the occurrence of leg cramps.\nStay properly hydrated throughout the day. Women need to drink at least 9 cups of water on a typical day, whereas men need to consume 13. However, on the day of cycling, individuals need to both makeup for the fluid lost while sweating and stay cool. Attach a water bottle filled with cool water to your bike and drink throughout the length of the ride. Doing so reduces the risk of dehydration, eliminating one common cause of muscle cramps.\nConsume proper amounts of potassium on a daily basis. Lack of potassium is another common cause of muscle cramping, and the Mayo Clinic website suggests consuming of 1,600 to 2,000 milligrams per day helps avoid potassium-related leg muscle cramping during cycling. Incorporate foods rich in potassium such as bananas and spinach into your daily meal plan. Avoid consuming too much potassium, as this can lead to a condition known as hyperkalemia.\nProperly stretch your leg muscles for 10 minutes before and after cycling. Include favorite stretches for hamstrings, quadriceps, hip flexors and calves, as these muscles are heavily stressed during a ride. To stretch your hamstrings, for example, sit on the ground and extend your legs outward in front of your body. Gently reach for your toes until you feel a gentle stretch.\nRide at least 10 minutes prior to the main ride. Cycle at an easy to moderate pace or choose an alternative method such as a jog for the warm-up period. This crucial step allows muscles time to slowly prepare for the vigorous strain produced by the ride and therefore reduces the occurrence of leg cramps.\nRecord your daily intake of water and potassium to ensure you consume an adequate amount of each."}

The challenge of tying these legacy stovepipes into common communications channels has proved daunting, but some areas of progress are beginning to emerge.\nTwo programs in different parts of the country are taking different approaches in their quest for interoperability. The Justice Department is building a nationwide network from the ground up, called the Integrated Wireless Network. IWN will serve agencies in DOJ and the Transportation and Homeland Security departments. And in Texas, a coalition of federal, state and local governments are using an overlay protocol to integrate legacy networks used by agencies in and around the Dallas Love Field Airport.\nWith both initiatives, program managers are finding a variety of technologies and standards to help bridge disparate systems.\nIWN is an ambitious undertaking, one that will connect federal agencies across the country. When fully deployed, the network is expected to serve more than 80,000 federal users within the three departments, and will be available to other federal agencies as well as state and local governments that want to connect to it. It will require an estimated 2,500 radio sites to provide the desired coverage in major metro areas, along major highways, along borders and ports of entry, and on Indian lands.\nIt has been a long time in coming. The program is a successor to a number of department-specific programs in Justice and Treasury. The partnership began in 2001, and Homeland Security was added when the Customs and Immigration and Naturalization services moved to the new department in 2003.\nThe groundwork for IWN has been laid in a pilot network now serving federal agencies in the Seattle area. Operational since 2004, this testbed is a VHF trunked land mobile radio network using the Project 25 standards for interoperability. It initially covered the state of Washington west of the Cascade Range, from the Canadian border to Oregon.\nThe full rollout of IWN already is well behind schedule though, with design contract awards originally set for last year. Officials have complained of inadequate funding as money has been diverted for other priorities.\nA 2002 engineering study estimated the cost of a full nationwide wireless system for federal law enforcement at about $3 billion, which has since been whittled down to $2.6 billion. Congress is dribbling out funds a bit at a time. DOJ and DHS will pay for infrastructure development and operation, and each agency will pay for its own endpoint equipment.\nIt entered the final phase of the acquisition process in June with the award of development contracts to teams headed by General Dynamics C4 Systems of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems Solutions of Gaithersburg, Md. Each team will design a network meeting IWN requirements for the U.S. southern border region, and DOJ will select a winner.\nThe department is not releasing time requirements for delivery of final designs or for implementing the network.\n'It will be a multiyear phased effort,' Duffy said.\nThe government does not specify the technology to be used in IWN and does not require any particular protocols.\n'Industry should develop proposals that it believes best meet the government's functional requirements,' the program told bidders.\nProject 25 is a suite of over-the"}

I was a psych major and I was about six months away from graduating and I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I definitely didn't want to go to graduate school. To do anything in psychology, you really need a graduate degree. So I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and I took a guitar I had and was looking for a place to get it altered, and I started looking at luthier (guitar making) schools ... There was one in Athens, so I went in there and interviewed with a guy and he said it was great idea.\nI played piano beforehand. I went to Brookstone and took piano classes there and really loved it. I was actually playing in the dining hall at UGA and playing four hours a day for three days a week and it burned me out so badly.\nHow did you and Jason come together?\nI did that apprenticeship at the luthier school. It's a place in Athens called Baxendale Guitar. Scott Baxendale is the master luthier there. I did that for about a year and then I started working there. A couple of months after my apprenticeship was over, Jason called me because his mom and my dad are both on the board at the Springer Opera House. They were talking about their sons building guitars. Jason is in his mid-40s, 43 maybe, so he's a lot older than I am. He found me on Facebook and called me, and we talked about it a little bit. Then he came down to Athens and showed me some of his stuff and I really liked it.\nHow did the dam wood come into play?\nJason was making guitars as a hobby. He had made two, maybe three, at that time. I left Baxendale in June 2013 and he called me in July and told me he was friends with Ron Lucas of Ron Lucas Construction. He had gone there to show Ron one of his guitars and Ron told him to look at a table that he made out of wood from the dam that they pulled out. Jason went, 'Oh my, god. Wouldn't it be a great idea to make guitars out of that wood.' So Ron gave him some of the wood from the dam and he called me and said, 'Hey, I would love for you to be involved in this project since you're from Columbus and everything.' ... The timing was perfect.\nFrom there, we spent about six months getting the whole idea together, testing different things out. Because the wood was under water for more than 150 years -- the dam was installed in the 1850s -- it is so soft. Being underwater that long, it was unstable. We could take a piece and just break it with our hands. Obviously, that wouldn't stand up under tension. So we had to try to figure out the best way to make it sturdier. We've done a couple of different things to do that.\nWe tried drying it, like kiln drying it, and it disintegrated. So what we do is we take a big Tupperware"}

In 1994, a tornado struck the church during worship services on Palm Sunday, killing 20 and injuring 96.\nOn Sunday, members will memorialize those who died that day and honor first responders at a 10 a.m. service.

Clinton Hubbard, district superintendent of the Cheaha District for the North Alabama Conference, is to speak.\nA covered dish lunch will follow the worship service in the family life center.\nFollowing are first-person reports from a survivor and a first responder who assisted members on that day.\n\u201cI was the administrative board chairman, whose job was to oversee the programs, attendance, finances and some of the other aspects of the church. My wife, Kathy, and two children, Shannon and Cody, were with me.\n\u201cI was sitting on the north side of the sanctuary toward the front of the sanctuary, along with other choir members. We were listening to the children, who were up front singing a Palm Sunday musical. Just as the program started, we heard the storm. Then gravel started hitting the stained-glass windows. I remember thinking that we had to get the kids down from the front area.\n\u201cI jumped up just as the lights went out, and that is all I remember of the actual strike.\n\u201cWhen I came to, my chest and right armed were pinned to the pew in front of me, and my left arm was pinned to the pew behind me. The roof from the south side of the building had shifted and landed on the north side on top of me and those of us sitting there. I tried to move and began hearing people moaning, crying, praying, screaming and everything you can imagine.\n\u201cI could barely breathe, and right before I felt I was going to die, I prayed for God to spare my kids and wife. The next thing I remember is trying to kick my legs free from the bricks and blocks.\n\u201cThen, a friend, Mike Tyree, saw me. He and others were yelling and grabbing my legs. As they pulled, the ceiling tiles were ripping my clothes. When freed, I headed toward the front where one of the female members was standing, trapped in blocks and covered with blood. I freed her, picked her up, and got her out.\n\u201cThen I saw another person lying on the floor not moving. She had no pulse. Then I remember two officers led me to a bench.

{"idx": "17550", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Yesterday marked the deadline for the initial public comment period on the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s pending net neutrality rulemaking, and by Tuesday afternoon, panelists participating in a webinar hosted by the Digital Policy Institute at Ball State were ready to make predictions on where they think the decision is headed.\nTheir first assessment: that anyone who has been advocating for Title II reclassification probably doesn\u2019t know what that means.\nNet neutrality is complicated and can mean different things in different contexts. To some, it means equal access to the Internet. To others, it means equal access to websites once connected. To others, still, it means equal streaming speed across websites\u2019 and users\u2019 data plans. To protect the ideas and ideals of net neutrality, and the Internet as an arena for business and innovation with almost no barrier-to-entry, the FCC is basically deciding between three options.\nThe first option \u2013 the one that many have called for on the FCC\u2019s comment page, and that the panelists were wary of \u2013 is to reclassify Internet as a utility that could be regulated under Title II of the Communications Act of 1996. With the Internet being regulated like traditional telephone companies, under Title II, Internet Service Providers would be subject to the same laws and restrictions as common carriers. Reclassification under Title II has been touted by many as the only way to guarantee that ISPs cannot block certain websites or create cost-prohibitive fast and slow Internet lanes, but that\u2019s not factually accurate. Title II reclassification would not necessarily prevent all hypothetical website discrimination; it would just place the Internet firmly under the FCC\u2019s power to regulate. It also would not necessarily, nor should it, affect Internet speed. When ISPs refer to fast and slow lanes, they\u2019re often referring not to plans they would create to charge users for higher connection speeds, but rather to the fact that certain websites and apps require priority in streaming. For example, video streamed online presently takes priority over a basic website page, because if the moving image is not running at the right speed and in the right order, the consumer will be unsatisfied with the connection. Users are generally not as sensitive to connection speed if they are, say, reading a news article slowly and thoroughly.\nThe second option available to the FCC is to go with a lighter handed approach, which is essentially what Chairman of the FCC Tom Wheeler originally proposed. This approach could entail creating a set of rules for how net neutrality can be maintained going forward, but would avoid any sweeping reclassification that could lead to unforeseen consequences and might stifle the very ideals and realities net neutrality is supposed to protect.\nThe third option was favored by most of yesterday\u2019s panelists: that the FCC does nothing at all, or as close to nothing as possible. Speaking with moderator, Ball State professor and communications attorney Barry Umansky were Babette E. Boliek, an associate professor of law at Pepperdine University; Harold Furchtgott-Roth, former FCC Commissioner and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute; Hal J. Singer, principal at Economists and Incorporated and senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute; and Brent Skorup, a research fellow in the Technology Policy Program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.\nWhile the panelists didn\u2019t necessarily agree on when they each thought the FCC might make its decision by, or which route exactly the FCC might take, they were all unanimously against Title II reclassification, and Boliek, Furchtgott-Roth, and Skorup all thought the FCC should \u2013 and may \u2013 err"}

For those unaware of \"the Wall,\" it's that painfully slow group ahead impeding your round. It's usually not intentional, yet the sight -- and subsequent stoppage -- of \"the Wall\" is an emotional dagger, on par with your family dog dying in front of your eyes moments after your wife leaves you for the tennis instructor. (Slight exaggeration.) This is especially true, and frustrating, when you feel like the course is wide open past this foursome of doom, one which seems oblivious to your plight.\nBut fear not; \"the Wall\" can be navigated. You just need to know the intricacies of tip-toeing past its wrath. Here are the do's and don'ts of skipping ahead.\nIf you're going to fly forward, it better not be on a whim. You should have visual evidence that the coast is clear on the upcoming holes. The last thing you want to do is make a jump, only to be stuck behind another group. Not only is your round still obstructed, you now have some explaining to do to the four angry golfers you just passed that are coming up the rear.\nSincerely thank them, but remember: you're making this leap because the round is moving at a glacial pace. Adding another player -- you -- to the mix isn't going to fix that matter. Graciously say, \"I'm OK,\" keep your head down and BAM, off you go.\nYes, this means your round will be shortened (more on this in a moment), but this outweighs the time lost by continuing to be stuck behind \"the Wall.\" In order to circumvent any confrontation, leave room between the group you just jumped and your new beginning.\nThere's always the chance you can return to the holes bypassed, simply by telling the starter or clubhouse that you left a wedge out on the course and you know exactly where it's at. But it's not a given that they'll let you back out. Moreover, there's a chance the holes in question will be log-jammed with traffic. If you really feel cheated, spend that saved time on the range or putting green.\nAs I've stated in these parts before, it's easier to ask forgiveness than to receive permission.\nYou want to be inconspicuous when skipping around; drawing attention to your act is not the way to go. Truthfully, most rangers don't know what's going on; if they did, issues like \"the Wall\" wouldn't exist. They are mainly there so they can get free golf the rest of the week, which is why most starters never leave the cart and spend most of their \"work\" making small-talk with their buddies on the course. If you pass a ranger, merely smile, tip your cap, and continue to go forward.\nNinety-nine percent of the time, we advocate walking over riding. HOWEVER, if you're trying to jump, you're going to need a set of wheels. A group will notice, but likely shrug off, a cart driving by. What they won't lose sight of is a golfer with a bag walking towards, then slowly past, their group. This allows more time for them to get insulted, and chances are they DO have a cart, one which they have no problem hopping in to address your behavior.

She beamed as students described how they had blossomed at the school, which offers a refuge from bullying, scorn and self-doubt.\nLeft unsaid, but widely understood, is that the Justice Department under Mr. Trump is likely to abandon groundbreaking civil rights litigation carried out during the Obama administration. Transgender Americans will be especially vulnerable. Both Ms. Lynch and Eric Holder, her predecessor as attorney general, embraced interpretations of civil rights law to extend protections to people facing discrimination for their gender identity. In May, Ms. Lynch delivered an impassioned speech about transgender rights in explaining the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to strike down a discriminatory state law in North Carolina.

Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, did try to spin the agreement this way, talking about \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d.\nThis is despite the fact that he had been forced to apply for a renewal of Greece\u2019s \u201cbailout\u201d under the supervision of the hated Troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB), and International Monetary Fund\u2014things he had ruled out only a few days earlier.\nBut Varoufakis\u2019s main antagonist, German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, did the opposite. He sought to rub in Syriza\u2019s humiliation after the deal was struck on Friday last week. \u201cThe Greeks certainly will have a difficult time to explain the deal to their voters,\u201d he said.\nIn other words, what Germany is worried about is continuing with the programme of neoliberal reforms that have been imposed on Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal.\nGermany and the European Union (EU) are trying to generalise these through the EU on the basis of the March 2012 Fiscal Pact. \u201cReform\u201d in the context means cutting and privatising public services, undermining workers\u2019 collective bargaining power, and the like.\nA mixture of motives lies behind the fixation on \u201creform\u201d. As we have seen in Britain, one ruling class reaction to the crisis has been to use it to radicalise neoliberalism\u2014restructuring societies to entrench the dominance of the \u201cfree\u201d market that precipitated the crisis in the first place.\nBut there are defensive motivations as well. During the 2000s the German ruling class overcame a long period of stagnation and rebuilt the export economy by squeezing wages.\nThey fear this model may be undermined if economies shattered by the crisis are rescued by government intervention financially underwritten by the EU.\nHence the drive to use the bailouts to generalise the German model. In southern Europe, where the competition comes from east Asian economies with much lower labour costs, this means a brutal squeeze on living standards.\nSyriza\u2019s election victory represents a mortal threat to this project. If austerity were rejected in Greece, this would give an enormous fillip to Podemos, the new radical left movement in the Spanish state, and encourage greater resistance elsewhere in Europe.\nSo Syriza has not only to be beaten, it has to be seen to be beaten. Of course, its multitude of supporters have been busy pointing to silver linings in Friday\u2019s deal.\nThere may be wriggle room for Varoufakis in the list of \u201creforms\u201d he must submit to the Eurogroup for approval. And maybe Greece will be allowed to spend a bit more.\nLet\u2019s hope so. But Germany has a powerful weapon in the Greek banks, which are leaking money. Last week the ECB threatened to cut off the aid that keeps them alive.\nThis is by no means the end of the fight. But it should be the end of the illusion that austerity can be ended by negotiating with the EU. Only mass struggles can beat it."}

No one can own a dance step.\" This is a common defense brought up as accusations of creative theft continue to mount against Epic, who are currently being sued by numerous musicians and creatives.\n\"Copyright law is clear that individual dance steps and simple dance routines are not protected by copyright, but rather are building blocks of free expression, which are in the public domain for choreographers, dancers, and the general public to use, perform, and enjoy,\" continued Cendali in the dismissal brief.

Those with means have hidden their homes behind walls and hired foreign security experts to advise them on how to avoid kidnappings and killings.

It was the work of the North America CF Gene Modifier Consortium, which brought together dozens of investigators from the United States, Canada, and from France, to identify genetic variations that could be linked with meconium ileus (MI), an intestinal obstruction that usually requires emergency surgery for treatment, and can result in a substantially increased rate of serious health problems.\nMI affects roughly 15-20 percent of all patients with CF, a genetic condition that causes scarring throughout the body, especially the lungs and pancreas. Though every CF patient carries mutations in both copies of the same gene - coding for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR - symptoms can vary widely from patient to patient.\nThe genome-wide association study (GWAS) of more than 3,700 CF patients identified non-CFTR genetic variants in the cell membrane that separates the interior of cells from the outside environment.

Apple also unveiled new iPads -- the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 -- and refreshed Macs during a more low-key event last week and introduced its Apple Pay mobile payments system.

{"idx": "17578", "prompt": "Continue the following text: There is something audacious about Elisha. He follows Elijah to what must have seemed to be the very brink of existence, and even then he seeks more. He pushes beyond earth's limits. Rather than shut his eyes against his impending loss, he keeps them wide open, so that he might see -- through inspired vision -- what fear and personal grief would deny him. Perhaps it is Elisha's boldness that makes possible the fulfilling of his request. The account goes on to say that Elisha did see Elijah as he ``went up by a whirlwind into heaven.''2 From this moment on, his life exhibited mastery over suffering, loss, accidents, and even death.\nYes, in the Bible people receive visions. But is there a vision for today? One that enables us, like Elisha, to receive a double portion of the spirit? A vision that will give us mastery as well as comfort?\nA friend of mine who lost her only son in Vietnam told me of her struggle to find such a vision after his tragic death. She had learned through Christian Science that God is Life and that man is not a finite body and soul but the reflection of God. Man's true identity is the individual, spiritual, eternal expression of Life, Truth, and Love -- of the one God. But these were mostly words until life itself demanded that her faith become vision. Such a concrete understanding seemed beyond her. But during the following month there was a lifting up. Through her study and prayer, through quiet receptivity to the one God, an inner guidance brought her through these darkest of hours.\nHer answer did not come simply as an explanation about life. Intellect is incapable of perceiving what spiritual understanding and faith alone can grasp. The answer came to her as experience. One day she actually felt a genuine sense of man's ongoing individuality and safe being. She ``saw'' the reality of her son's ``living'' more vividly than his absence. It was not supernatural. Rather it felt more natural to her than grief. She was filled with a spiritual joy, a joy that must have been God's own joy, because it had no possible human source or justification. Since then, both this joy and clear vision have continued to become more real to her.\nI am still praying about the recent death of our friends' son. I am still praying for an inspired vision. But the true stories related here have inspired me to pray more boldly, to stand up to the despair inherent in the conviction that life is fragile and fleeting. If we are to heal the immense loss of such tragedies as the Pan Am flight, we must bring to this day something more than mere words, something more than human thoughts, however hopeful these might be.\nThe actual glimpsing of life as wholly spiritual, existing intact within the being of God, is a present possibility. God will provide the grace and the ability to have bold expectation. And through the unity of these, inspiration will reveal what our senses shut out: that each of us actually exists in a larger sense of Life than earth's narrow stage. Each dearly beloved child of God is protected and cared for by divine Love, both now and always.\n1II Kings 2:10. 2II Kings 2:11. 3The Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science. 4Science and Health, p. 108. 5Ibid.\nBlessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes....

To NASA, it's a relic that drains funds from Russia's contribution to the International Space Station Alpha. But however it's perceived, Russia's long-playing space station Mir, whose name means \"Peace,\" is about to exit the space flight scene.\nRussian controllers are preparing to bring it down as soon as March 12. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, it should splash into \"the southern part of the Pacific Ocean, far away from sea and air routes.\" That means an area some 120 miles wide by 3,600 miles long east of New Zealand's southern end.\nhas deorbited. The original core and one additional module form a long cylinder to which unmanned Progress cargo craft and manned Soyuz space ships dock. At one end, four additional laboratory modules are mounted at right angles to the core and to each other. The structure, measuring 86 by 96 by 99 feet, looks like an aircraft engine with a four-blade propeller. Solar-cell arrays stick out from the modules in various directions to give it that \"tumbleweed\" look.\nThis is the cramped, dusty, noisy, crammed-with-stuff environment in which 42 Russian cosmonauts and their 63 foreign guests gave humanity its first lessons in long-term space flight. It could also have provided the first \"reality TV,\" if there had been the necessary communications links. Asked if he had any privacy during the final Mir mission in 1999, French astronaut Jean-Pierre Haignere replied with a laconic \"No.\"\nThat close environment, which Mr. Haignere said sometimes smelled \"like burnt coffee,\" made strong demands on the crews' social skills. It also fostered mutual respect and a degree of mutual understanding. NASA Astronaut David Wolf told the industry journal Space News that early-cosmonaut \"don't touch any-thing\" attitudes toward Americans gave way to full acceptance as fellow crew members.\nShannon Lucid has a vignette that makes the point of person-to-person understanding. Writing in the Scientific American, she recalled quiet moments during her six-month tour in 1996 when crew members talked about themselves. \"After a while, we realized we had all grown up with the same fear: an atomic war between our two countries,\" she wrote.\nNow that demanding orbital home presents its controllers with a final challenge - how to bring it down safely in a controlled manner. An unmanned Progress cargo craft now docked with Mir carries extra fuel. Progress will fire its thrusters four times. Should the remote control of these operations fail, a cosmonaut crew is standing by to fly to Mir and take over.\nNo one knows exactly how the complex structure will break up and disintegrate as it reenters Earth's atmosphere. Parts of Mir should start burning when they reach 70 miles altitude. Solar arrays and lighter aluminum parts should burn up completely. However, some 1,500 stronger aluminum and titanium parts - up to 27.5 tons - may reach the surface, according to an Associated Press report. Some of the pieces could weigh up to 1,500 pounds.\nThe Russians seem determined to do all they"}

It is estimated that currently there are 6 gigawatts of wind energy capacity held back due to objections from civil and MoD aviation authorities. This is enough capacity to power 3.4 million homes.\nSimon Christian, Project Director at ScottishPower Renewables and Chair of the Aviation Investment Fund Company said: The industry is delighted to have set up the AIFCL and that this major contract has been made between all the parties.

The signing of this document demonstrates the commitment of the Government, the aviation industry and the wind industry to investigate how new technologies may be used to enable the wind industry to work more closely with the aviation community in addressing climate change.\nWhile the Raytheon solution has the potential to fix the en route radar problem, issues still remain with MoD radar, and the Aviation Investment Fund Company has also recently committed to fund a MoD and IBM study for expanding the UK Air Defence and Ground Environment Command and Control System (UCCS) to accept air traffic control radar feeds as wind farm mitigation.\n1. BWEA is the trade and professional body for the UK wind and marine renewables industries. Formed in 1978, and with 532 corporate members, BWEA is the leading renewable energy trade association in the UK. Wind has been the world's fastest growing renewable energy source for the last seven years, and this trend is expected to continue with falling costs of wind energy and the urgent international need to tackle CO2 emissions to prevent climate change.\n2. Fourteen member companies of BWEA have joined forces investing in a central industry fund - the Aviation Investment Fund Company - so that resources can be directed towards addressing the radar issue. NATS En Route have been appointed to manage the Research and Development with Raytheon Canada, the suppliers of the radar system.\n3.

Companies trading in the States are required to file 10-Qs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by 45 calendar days after quarter-ends. Canadian companies have similar requirements. In other countries with half-year reporting, many companies still partially report quarterly.\nThe definitive list of elite junior gold stocks to analyze used to come from the world\u2019s most-popular junior-gold-stock investment vehicle. This week the GDXJ VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF reported $4.4b in net assets. Among all gold-stock ETFs, that was only second to GDX\u2019s $8.1b. That is GDXJ\u2019s big-brother ETF that includes larger major gold miners. GDXJ\u2019s popularity testifies to the great allure of juniors.\nUnfortunately this fame has recently created major problems severely hobbling the usefulness of GDXJ. This sector ETF has shifted from being beneficial for junior gold miners to outright harming them. GDXJ is literally advertised as a \u201cJunior Gold Miners ETF\u201d. Investors only buy GDXJ shares because they think this ETF gives them direct exposure to junior gold miners\u2019 stocks. But unfortunately that\u2019s no longer true!\nGDXJ is quite literally the victim of its own success. This ETF grew so large in the first half of 2016 as gold stocks soared in a massive upleg that it risked running afoul of Canadian securities law. Most of the world\u2019s junior gold miners and explorers trade in Canada. In that country once any investor including an ETF goes over 20% ownership in any stock, it is deemed a takeover offer that must be extended to all shareholders!\nUnderstanding what happened in GDXJ is exceedingly important for junior-gold-stock investors, and I explained it in depth in my past essay on juniors\u2019 Q1\u201917 results. GDXJ\u2019s managers were forced to reduce their stakes in leading Canadian juniors. So capital that GDXJ investors intended to deploy in junior gold miners was instead diverted into much-larger gold miners. GDXJ\u2019s effective mission stealthily changed.\nNot many are more deeply immersed in the gold-stock sector than me, as I\u2019ve spent decades studying, trading, and writing about this contrarian realm. These huge GDXJ changes weren\u2019t advertised, and it took even me months to put the pieces together to understand what was happening. GDXJ\u2019s managers may have had little choice, but their major direction change has been devastating to true junior gold miners.\nInvestors naturally pour capital into GDXJ, the \u201cJunior Gold Miners ETF\u201d, expecting to own junior gold miners. But instead of buying junior gold miners\u2019 shares and bidding up their prices, GDXJ is instead shunting those critical inflows to the much-larger mid-tier and even major gold miners.

The person requested anonymity because the move is not official.\nStoops becomes the latest in a line of prominent coaches to work with Nick Saban as part of the program\u2019s support staff in a role as an analyst or consultant.\nStoops, the younger brother of former Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, was the Sooners\u2019 defensive coordinator from 1999-2003, building dominant defenses as the Sooners won a national championship and were among the nation\u2019s elite programs. He was Arizona\u2019s head coach from 2004-11, going 41-50, then returned to Oklahoma in 2012.\nBut in his return, the Sooners\u2019 defense never reached its former dominance.

They also have to make sure that their kids have every opportunity to succeed in life, and that means countless hours shuttling them between school, sports practices, music lessons, doctor appointments, sports games and Scout meetings. It means taking time off work to chaperone field trips and swapping shifts with a co-worker so that you can make it to the mid-week meet. And it means skimping on sleep so you can prep healthy lunches and dinners, co-sleep with an anxiety-riddled toddler, and catch up on the never-ending avalanche of household chores.\nOh, and while they're dealing with all of that, parents today are bombarded with social media images featuring perfect parents who seemingly get it all done with ease.\nIs it any wonder then that parents experience burnout?\nFor most parents, parenthood comes with its ups and downs. But parental burnout is different. Like the burnout that some may experience in the workplace, it's defined by feelings of exhaustion, inefficiency and emotional detachment. It goes beyond just a simple bad day and is more like weeks or months of bad days that leave parents feeling chronically sleep-deprived, unable to complete daily tasks, and disconnected from those they love.\nIn other words, when you collapse onto your sofa with a glass of wine and the TV remote in an effort to have five minutes of me-time at the end of a long day, you are probably just experiencing a normal day in the life of a parent. But if you're too tired to pick up that wine or remote because you're exhausted and \"touched-out,\" you may be feeling parental burnout.\nAccording to Penelope Pewter, author of \"The Busy Mom's Guide to Quick and Easy Relaxation and Stress Relief,\" being forgetful, snapping at loved ones, and waking up in the mornings still exhausted are all signs that you may be experiencing parental burnout.\nDr. Fran Walfish, Beverly Hills family and relationship psychotherapist and author of \"The Self-Aware Parent,\" has this advice for parents who are feeling burned out. \"Prioritize who needs you the most. Sometimes your children will need you most while other times your husband or work will come front and center. Be flexible and try to go with the flow. Also, enlist help and calendar in some 'me' time when you can relax, regroup, and recharge.\"\nThe big takeaway here is to know that if you are feeling parental burnout, you're definitely not alone. Scientists may have just confirmed its existence, but it's something that parents have known about \u2014 and experienced \u2014 for a very long time."}

Still, the unemployment rate fell to a 4\u00bd-year low of 7.4 percent, a hopeful sign.\nUnemployment declined from 7.6 percent in June because more Americans found jobs, and others stopped looking and were no longer counted as unemployed.\nStill, Friday's report from the Commerce Department pointed to a less-than-robust job market. It suggested that the economy's subpar growth and modest consumer spending are making many businesses cautious about hiring.\nThe government said employers added a combined 26,000 fewer jobs in May and June than it previously estimated. Americans worked fewer hours in July, and their average pay dipped. And many of the jobs employers added last month were for lower-paying work at stores, bars and restaurants.\nFor the year, job growth has remained steady. The economy has added an average 200,000 jobs a month since January, though the pace has slowed in the past three months to 175,000.\nFriday's jobs report \"reveals a mixed labor market picture of continued improvement, but at a still frustratingly slow pace,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\nThe reaction from investors was slightly downbeat. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 22 points in early-afternoon trading, and broader stock indexes also declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.62 percent from 2.71 percent.\nThe Federal Reserve will review the July employment data in deciding whether to slow its $85 billion a month in bond purchases in September, as many economists have predicted it will do. Weaker hiring could make the Fed hold off on any pullback in its bond buying, which has helped keep long-term borrowing costs down.\nYet it's possible that the lower unemployment rate, along with the hiring gains over the past year, could convince the Fed that the job market is strengthening consistently.\n\"While July itself was a bit disappointing, the Fed will be looking at the cumulative improvement,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. \"On that score, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent last August to 7.4 percent this July, which is a significant improvement.\"\nBut Beth Ann Bovino, senior economist at Standard & Poor's, said she thinks Friday's report will make the Fed delay any slowdown in its bond purchases.\n\"September seems very unlikely now,\" she says. \"I'm wondering if December is still in the cards.\"\nThe decline in unemployment to 7.4 percent was derived from a survey of households, which found that 227,000 more people said they were employed last month. And 37,000 people stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.\nThe job gain for the month was calculated from a separate survey of employers.\nThough much of July's job growth was in lower-paying industries, manufacturing, a generally good-paying sector, added 6,000 jobs. That increase was driven by job growth at auto plants. Those were the first such gains at U.S. factories since February.\nJobs in professional services, such as finance, accounting and information technology, also rose.\nGovernments added jobs for the first time since April.

Puar writes about what she calls \"Israeli tactical calculations of settler colonial rule \u2013 that of creating injury and maintaining Palestinian populations as perpetually debilitated, and yet alive, in order to control them.\" Puar states, \"Debilitation is extremely profitable economically and ideologically for Israel's settler colonial regime.\"\nA prominent 2016 piece in the Wall Street Journal by Mark G.

At least eight members of DUP's Editorial Advisory Board and staff have appeared to publicly support initiatives related to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, appearing as signatories of various BDS-oriented initiatives, and often using social media to promote and defend BDS.\nAt the time of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal, Ken Wissoker, the DUP Editorial Director of Books Acquisitions Group, Tweeted, \"Tell Congress: you work for me, not for Netanyahu,\" which sounds eerily reminiscent of the anti-Semitic canard that Jews are conspiring to rule and dominate the world. In the same Tweet, Wissoker included a link to a Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) announcement on the Iran issue. The Anti-Defamation League refers to JVP as \"the largest and most influential Jewish anti-Zionist group in the United States\" and warns that JVP uses language \"that veers uncomfortably close to age-old anti-Semitic canards.\"\nAlso on Twitter, DUP Editorial Associate Sandra Korn celebrates \"our NEW BDS campaign in Durham !!!!!\" Korn is listed as a member of the Facebook group \"International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network.\" The group explains, \"we struggle against Zionism.\" One may wonder if part of the mission or agenda of DUP is also to struggle against Zionism. The official DUP Twitter account has made more than 20 Tweets which include \"#BDS.\" It would to appear to some that DUP is championing BDS on social media.\nClearly there are a large number of personnel involved with DUP who appear to selectively attack Israel and advocate for positions that delegitimize, demonize, and utilize double standards against Israel.

While Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov struts around the region trying to restore Russian prestige to its old Soviet level, his country's very severe economic and military weaknesses undercut his ability to make it a Middle Eastern power. Worse, Russia's badly disjointed policymaking process, in which a wide range of institutions conflict over policy with each other and the foreign ministry, hamper his efforts and render unclear Russia's goals in the region.\nTo understand Russia's current position, as well as to see the purpose of its policies, requires an analysis of the interplay of the forces making Russian foreign policy, the impact of the country's military and economic weakness, and then a look at policies toward key states\u2014Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Israel.\nThree factions dominate the debate. (1) Atlanticists place primary emphasis on good ties with the United States and want Russia to be part of Western civilization. On the key issue of Russian policy toward the \"Near Abroad\" (the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union), Atlanticists advocate normal diplomatic relations between sovereign states, reject the idea of Russia seeking to impose its will, and are generally favorably disposed towards Israel. In the area of economics, they advocate rapid reform and privatization. (2) Eurasianists, in the middle of the Russian political spectrum, advocate a foreign policy that equally emphasizes Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. They forward an assertive policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Near Abroad, whereby Russia is clearly the dominant outside power. They advocate economic reform and privatization but at a slower pace than the Atlanticists. (3) An odd combination of ultra-nationalists and unrepentant Communists advances an outspokenly anti-American (and anti-Israel) foreign policy. They seek the reestablishment of Russian hegemony in the Near Abroad and call for Russia to be a strong, centralized state.\nInstitutionally, the main actors making Russian policy toward the Middle East divide into several sectors: the executive branch, other governmental branches, and non-governmental organizations.\nExecutive branch. In theory at least, Yeltsin and his staff have the last word in foreign policy, but he has been both ill and preoccupied with domestic politics. Consequently, a battle royal has taken place among groups and institutions seeking to influence foreign policy.\nAs for Primakov, he inherited a Foreign Ministry in January 1996 that was particularly ineffectual at leading and coordinating foreign policy due to youth and lack of experience in the higher echelons of the Soviet bureaucracy of his predecessor, Andrei Kozyrev (who served as foreign minister in 1992-95) and to Kozyrev's facing a host of rival governmental and non-governmental organizations. As a result, what should have been the most important of institutions in the making of foreign policy had become just one of many contenders.\nReformers such as Boris Nemtzov and Anatoly Chubais retain very important positions and make up an influential group in foreign policymaking. Nemtzov is currently primus inter pares among the three deputy prime ministers and sits in for the prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, when the later leaves"}

It is situated on a patch of desert at the edge of Los Lunas, which lies just beyond the edge of New Mexico\u2019s largest metropolitan area and along the Rio Grande.\nEach of the data center\u2019s buildings is roughly the size of four football fields and has several \u201cdata halls,\u201d or darkened, vast rooms where Facebook plans to store dozens of rows of towering servers.

While congressional testimony in recent months has solidified how intertwined Facebook has become in people\u2019s lives and ventures, there also has been mounting concern over past data-sharing practices.\nIn New Mexico, state and local officials in 2016 touted the data center as a much-needed economic boost for the area. U.S. Census figures show Los Lunas has some 15,000 residents with an average income of about $24,000.\nAn average of about 1,100 construction workers have been working at the Facebook site daily, and about 150 employees and contract workers are currently working desk, security and other jobs inside its one open building. Melanie Roe, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company expects the number of employees to eventually reach 300.\nIn New Mexico, the Los Lunas Village Council agreed in 2016 to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual Facebook payments that were to start at $50,000 and top out at nearly a half-million dollars.\nThe agreement that also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time helped the small town win over Facebook.

And before that, a Quran was torn up and smeared with feces before being left at the door of a Texas mosque.\nHeadlines like these now appear on a fairly consistent basis, cataloguing a growing list of vandalisms, threats and even violent attacks on Muslims in the United States.\n\"Even before the recent attacks, hate crimes and threats against Muslim, Arab, and South Asian Americans were at the highest they had been since 9/11.

According to Muslim Advocates, a legal advocacy group based in California, there have been 32 anti-Muslim threats, shootings and vandalisms in the U.S. since Nov. 13 Paris attacks \u2014 in less than a month.\nShiite Muslims rally for peace outside of the White House in Washington, on Dec. 6, 2015.\nTracking a rise in the number of such incidents is tricky. Not many data sources log these statistics specifically; the closest data source is the FBI's annual hate crime statistics report. The agency found that while the total number of hate crimes had dropped between 2013 and 2014, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in that time period has risen from 135 to 154.\nWhile the FBI's data is generally considered to underestimate the number of hate crimes, experts accept it as an indicator of general trends, according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. For example, the data showed a 50% increase in anti-Muslim crimes in 2010 and reflected the spike in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nFor advocacy organizations like the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations (CAIR) that work with Muslim Americans, the focus has been to support community members who have been targets of anti-Muslim sentiment, said Corey Saylor, a director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Data entry comes second.\nHowever, CAIR does track the number of incidents against mosques on an annual basis. By their numbers, as of July 31, 2015, the number of anti-mosque incidents already equaled the total number of such incidents in all of 2014. While the data for this year is not yet complete, \"my guess is it\u2019ll be the worst year on record since 2010,\" Saylor said.\nThe current wave of Islamophobia started as early as 2014, when the Islamic State released a video that showed the beheading an American journalist. The attacks in Paris and San Bernardino \"ramped up\" the cycle once again, Saylor added.\nJudging from the current environment, comments like Trump\u2019s and Cruz's are readings on a barometer that is pointing toward a new level of hatred to come."}

The researchers believe this explains why cases of herpes can sometimes return after the virus has long lain dormant in a host.\nMost people in the US get oral herpes - or herpes simplex virus type 1 - by the age of 20. Following the first infection - usually after 1 or 2 weeks - the virus will become dormant in the facial nerve tissues.\nOccasionally, however, the virus may reactivate and cause milder cold sore symptoms.\nIn total, there are eight herpes viruses that can affect humans. Some versions of the virus can cause chickenpox, mononucleosis and cancer.\n\"Probably 95% of us have been infected with at least one herpes virus, but many people never have a problem with it,\" says study co-author Rolf Renne, PhD, a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology in the University of Florida (UF) College of Medicine and a member of the UF Genetics Institute and the UF Health Cancer Center.\n\"The question has been: what happens to reactivate these viruses to cause disease?\"\nThe researchers found that interferon gamma kept the herpes virus dormant, but when the immune system responded to a helminth infection, the virus would reactivate.\nIn co-operation with researchers from Washington University in St. Louis, MO, Renne and his UF colleagues investigated how human herpes virus 8 - a herpes virus linked to the Kaposi's sarcoma cancer - reactivates. They publish their findings in the journal Science.\nWorking first with a mouse model, and then replicating their findings in human subjects, the team found that after initial infection, the protein interferon gamma kept the virus dormant in the body.\nHowever, the effect of the interferon gamma was cancelled out following an infection from a helminth worm - a common parasite in sub-Saharan Africa, where Kaposi's sarcoma is also common.\nThe researchers observed that another protein called interleukin 4 was released by the immune system to deal with the helminth, but this blocked the interferon gamma function and also activated the replication function of the herpes virus.\nReplication of the virus causes new cells to be infected, increasing the chances that a cancerous tumor will form.\n\"The fact that the virus can 'sense' the immune reaction to a worm and respond by reactivating is a remarkable example of co-evolution.\nWe think other interactions between multiple infectious agents and the immune system will be discovered over time that we will view as similarly sophisticated or maybe even devious. Understanding these interactions will help us survive in a complex microbial world.\"\nEarlier this week, Medical News Today reported on research from scientists at the University of Montreal in Canada who suggest that a small molecule found in the urine of pregnant women blocks the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as a variety of other cancers.

Restaurant enthusiasts read these reviews to determine where they'll dine out. Food critics evaluate food quality, taste, ambiance and service in fine-dining, mid-scale and even food retail establishments, and then write reviews for magazines and newspapers . . . or for television shows. They earn salaries averaging just under $90,000 annually.\nWhile food critics such as Calvin Trillin and A.A. Gill may six-figure incomes and higher, most food critics earn far less. The average annual salary for a food critic was $88,000 per year as of 2013, according to the jobsite Indeed. Many food critics have bachelor's degrees in English, journalism or communications, but it's not always required. For example, a freelance writer with significant restaurant experience may only have a high school degree. Publishers and broadcast stations may prefer hiring those with one or more years' experience as food critics. Other essential requirements include an attention to detail, a willingness to travel, and writing, analytical, creative and computer skills.\nIn 2013, average salaries for food critics varied considerably in most of the four U.S. regions, according to Indeed. In the South region, they earned the highest salaries of $104,000 in Washington, D.C., and the lowest of $75,000 in Louisiana. Those in the West made $59,000 and $96,000 in Hawaii and California, respectively. Food critics in the Northeast earned $76,000 and $106,000 per year in Maine and New York, respectively. In the Midwest, they earned the most in Illinois and the least in South Dakota -- $95,000 and $66,000, respectively.\nA food critic may earn more in certain industries. For example, writers' and authors' salaries were highest when they work as freelancers as of May 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. They also earned relatively high salaries as employees of cable and other subscription-paid television programs -- $81,200 versus and industry average of $68,420 for all writers and authors. Although the BLS doesn't report salaries for food critics, they may earn more freelancing or working for cable companies as writers, journalists or television show hosts. Food critics may also earn higher salaries working for prestigious food magazines such as \"Bon Appetit\" and \"Gourmet.\"\nThe BLS doesn't forecast jobs for food critics. It only projects a 6 percent increase in jobs for writers between 2010 and 2020, and an 8 percent decrease for reporters and correspondents. Job growth for both of these professions are below the national growth rate of 14 percent for all occupations. On a positive note, the National Restaurant Association expects a 3.8 percent increase in restaurant sales in 2013, which may increase jobs for food critics.

Thomas Kilgore Jr., a leading figure in the struggle for racial justice and one of the few men to lead two major national Baptist organizations, died Wednesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. Mr. Kilgore was pastor emeritus of Second Baptist Church, the oldest black Baptist church in Los Angeles. He was 84.\nMr. Kilgore, who lived in Los Angeles, became pastor at Second Baptist in 1963. He had spent the previous 16 years as pastor of Friendship Baptist Church in Harlem, where he rose to prominence in the civil rights movement.\nMr. Kilgore began his efforts for equality in the 1940's registering voters and organizing tobacco workers in North and South Carolina. In Harlem, he worked to end segregation in the schools and in housing.\nIn the 1950's and 1960's, he worked closely with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and played a significant role in his Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the South and on both coasts. He was a primary organizer of the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom to Washington in 1957 and of the civil rights March on Washington of 1963.\nBy the late 1960's, the American Baptist Convention -- since 1972 the American Baptist Churches USA -- was feeling pressure from its black members, who were a minority among the 1.5 million congregants. Demands for a qualified African-American steward led to Mr. Kilgore's nomination and overwhelming election as the organization's first black president.\nHe was installed at the annual meeting in 1969 and served for a year. Only one other predominantly white Protestant body -- the United Presbyterian Church -- had selected a black leader by that time. The Presbyterian group had chosen the Rev. Dr. Elder G. Hawkins as its moderator in 1964.\nMr. Kilgore went on to lead the majority black Progressive National Baptist Convention and its membership of more than two million. He served as its president from 1976 to 1978.\nMr. Kilgore was born in Woodruff, S.C., and graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1935. He moved to Manhattan after serving congregations in the Carolinas. He received his divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary in 1957.\nAs pastor of Freedom Baptist Church on West 131st Street, he raised bail money for civil rights workers jailed in the South well before Dr. King's name became a household word.\nHe also served as founding president of the Heart of Harlem Neighborhood Church Association, an arm of the city's Protestant Council, organized in 1957 to counter segregation in New York.\nIn Los Angeles, he worked toward ecumenism and, particularly after the 1992 riots, for dialogue across racial lines. He also was instrumental in getting the University of California at Los Angeles to become more involved socially with the surrounding community.\nMr. Kilgore assumed the status of senior pastor at Second Baptist in 1985.\nHe is survived by his wife, Jeannetta; two daughters, Jini Ross of Katy, Tex., and Lynn Elda Hendy of New York City; two sisters, Malissa Briley of Los Angeles, and Ella Maye Adams of Goldsboro, N.C.; two brothers, Thaddus, of"}

Most all the coverage on mining focuses on high-end desktop discrete graphics cards since they turn the most profit. The only problem is that most all those cards are sold out and happen to be in such high demand that pricing is out of this world. The good news is that you can start mining on lower-end graphics cards fairly easily and without taking out a second mortgage or selling off body parts. Read on to find out how!\n$30 a month before electric costs....no, just no LOL.\n$10 per day with a card... would be nice.. Last year around June it was $4-5 per day with the higher-end cards. A $199 Radeon RX 480 would pay for itself in under 2 months. The real money was made by those that held the $200-$300 coins and then sold it off when it went up to $1450 per coin in Jan 2018. So, if you re-do the math you were making well over $10 a day... You just didn't know that at the time.\nMining with a GTX 1050 Ti isn't bad to be honest. It's silent and puts out very little heat compared to the big cards.\nRight now in STL we are in the winter rate period. (8.76 cents for the first 750 kWh and 6.00 cents for anything over that). You likely use 750 kWh a month without mining, so any mining you do is at 6 cents per kWh. That is some of the cheapest power in the World and we are lucky for that. Summer rates (June-September) are 12.58 cents, so now is the time to mine in our area.\nSo, A GeForce GTX 1050 Ti mining ETH at 14 MH/s brings in $1.00 per day. At 75 Watts power draw for the whole system the profit per day would be $0.87. About $27 a month in pure profit. So, 5 months of mining and the profit will cover the MSRP of the card ($139) and everything beyond that is pure profit. Not bad considering how little work there is to do. Once you dial the systems in you can literally let them be for weeks at a time. Toss four of these little cards into an old system a gamer might have and you can make easily over $1,000 a year. If cryptocurrency prices shoot up then you are making much more than that.\nPut it this way... Back in May/June 2017 you could easily mine a coin every week with a small mining setup. Four a month at $200 a coin and you were making $800 a month. Sweet, but not life changing right? Last month at the all time high you would have made $5,800 that month if you held what you mined and sold then. If you continued to hold right now you'd have $3,400.\nI'm not sure if this all makes sense as it is 6am, but don't be blinded by low prices now as they might go up. I'm mining some coins at a loss with the hopes they pop. That is the nice thing about mining as you can mine the most profitable coins or any of the other 900.\nYep it does make sense man!

On its first jaunt far from home, my new cell phone made my watch obsolete by sensing time zones and automatically adapting. One night in a historic inn far from the world of 10-buck-a-night hotel broadband, an 802.11 signal came wafting in on the breeze. Moments such as these are gifts from a future in which technology just seems to do the right thing, quietly and unobtrusively.\nBut such moments are few and far between. As the novelist William Gibson famously said, \"The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed.\" Too often, our expectations are raised only to be shattered. Why, for example, does Expedia ask you to specify the number of children traveling with you, and even their ages, and then proceed to show you hotel rooms that can't accommodate the kids?\nWhen I'm traveling on business, I get to bypass this nonsense. I just call up IDG Travel and talk to Bruce or Michael. These guys can hack through the plane/hotel/rental-car system like hot knives through butter. It's true they have access to privileged information, but I'm sure they could also make better use of public information than you or I. Their ability to recognize and exploit patterns is what makes them so effective.\nFrom science fiction we've absorbed the idea that software systems would behave like Bruce and Michael. In real life that doesn't happen. Arguably it can't, because artificial intelligence is just a sci-fi fantasy. And arguably it shouldn't, because we want human expertise to remain a marketable commodity. But between the dumb software we use and the smart software we imagine lies an important middle ground waiting to be occupied.\nConsider e-mail. It gets a bad rap at the moment, deservedly so. Almost all of the e-mail I picked up while traveling was malicious junk generated by the Sobig.F worm. For me this was a nonevent, because SpamAssassin was effective in this case. But if I'd had to delete messages by hand, as it seems many folks did, SpamBayes would have quickly recognized the pattern and automated the task.\nIn the wake of the Sobig.F flood came the predictable reactions: E-mail is polluted, broken, a dead medium. For certain purposes that's true. In our recent feature on spam I argued that IM is a better solution for real-time communication, as is RSS for bulk notification. But let's not kid ourselves. Factor out spam completely, as my current combination of filters has done for me, and you only do away with a problem. There remains a vast unexploited opportunity.\nThanks to the SpamBayes plug-in, my e-mail client does a great job of learning which messages I do or don't want to see. But it should do so much more! My work life is organized around groups and projects that form and evolve in fluid ways. E-mail folders and filters help me manage these activities. I want to be pleasantly surprised by software that notices when message patterns indicate the formation of a group or project, and volunteers to set up folders and filters for me. Likewise, I want to be pleasantly surprised by an RSS newsreader that notices how I save and organize items from my subscribed feeds. No breakthrough in artificial intelligence is needed to make this happen. We do the pattern recognition ourselves, quite naturally, as we process our information flows. If software paid"}

Robb Nansel, 32, and Jason Kulbel, 34, are a big part of its present.\nYears after meeting in college while working at a Blockbuster store, the two now run Saddle Creek Records, an independent label perhaps best known for the act Bright Eyes, led by the singer Conor Oberst.\nLast June, they opened a brick complex in NoDo housing their offices, the nearly 600-capacity club and bar Slowdown (named for an Omaha band Slowdown Virginia) and Film Streams, an independent non-profit movie theater. Tenants also include graphic artists, a skateboard shop and Urban Outfitters, downtown Omaha\u2019s first national retailer in decades.\nAmerican Apparel is coming, as is a coffee bar. Nansel and Kulbel live here; the weeds are part of their western view.\nOmaha asked them to build their $10 million complex in NoDo, whose name recalls New York\u2019s SoHo and Denver\u2019s LoDo districts. It was once home to industrial and metals plants. Many Omahans have long thought of it mainly as a place people drove through to get to the airport.\nMany locals and tourists now congregate in the Old Market, a former warehouse district a mile southeast of NoDo and now a vibrant blend of modern restaurants, shops and nightlife.\nMost agree the 2003 opening of the nearby Qwest Center, a convention hall and arena big enough to attract acts such as The Police and Bruce Springsteen, was a major step toward bringing Omaha, population 420,000, up in the pantheon of U.S. cities.\nBusinesses in the Saddle Creek complex \u201chave an aesthetic and a mission that go far beyond the bottom line,\u201d said Rachel Jacobson, who runs Film Streams.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only major city in a wide radius, so it might make sense to spread out, but it\u2019s hard to develop a vibrant culture if you just keep sprawling,\u201d she said.\nIn assessing what to do with NoDo, Mayor Mike Fahey turned a few years ago to Nansel and Kulbel, who had struck out trying to open Slowdown in another part of Omaha.\nMore is coming to the area.

Two hotels just north of Saddle Creek have opened since November.\nGoss thinks NoDo, once developed, could add $400 million a year to the area\u2019s economy.\nThat\u2019s how the Urban Outfitters store might fit in.\nFahey, who is using Portland, Oregon\u2019s Pearl District as a model, thinks it will take fewer than 10 years to transform NoDo.

Now, halfway through its third season, its pushing things further.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to reflect that we\u2019re becoming very established. We\u2019re occupying a little more territory, so we might as well own it a little bit,\u201d says Bee, who likens the sleek, new design to the moment when Sandy gets made over at the end of Grease.\nAnd the transformation is apparent. The previous set was a long, skinny platform with a pair of larger monitors behind it, which was dramatically destroyed in August before the show took a brief hiatus. Now, the stage literally takes up more space, with a wider area for more Music Man-like moments and plenty of space for Bee to move around in.\n\u201cI think what it really represents is we now have the opportunity to pursue these big ideas,\u201d she adds.\nNot only does the app encourage engagement through cash prizes and challenges meant to check things like users\u2019 voter registration, but it introduces \u201ccomedy into this space\u201d -- something the Full Frontal team says hasn\u2019t been done before. The game itself mixes AP U.S. History-type questions with some political humor -- all in the voice of the show, which Ghalayini admittedly says was the hardest thing to perfect.\n\u201cIt would be nice to imagine that people could -- unrelated to the show -- just play the game and actually enjoy it on its own merits,\u201d Bee ultimately says of the app, which she hopes will be played by people who aren\u2019t even regular viewers.\nWhen it comes to the show itself, there will always be a necessary urgency to what Full Frontal covers -- especially as the November midterm elections near -- and it will continue to push beyond expectations, but the format is not expected to change. The team views going on location (especially the Emmy-nominated Puerto Rico special), as one-off ideas that feel inspired, not a drive to constantly take the show on the road.\nFull Frontal With Samantha Bee airs Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET / 9:30 p.m. CT on TBS."}

Reform won\u2019t be easy, he said, but it cannot wait another year.\nWe asked some health care experts, who have seen attempts at comprehensive reform founder over the years, what might make a difference this time.\nElliott S. Fisher, a professor of medicine, is director of the Center for Health Policy Research at Dartmouth Medical School.\nIn calling for reform, President Obama emphasized the critical importance of bringing the soaring cost of health care. To do that, we need to address the underlying causes: a fragmented care system; lack of accountability for the overall costs and quality of care; a payment system that rewards growth and unnecessary care.\nOur research, documented in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, shows there are remarkable regional variations in spending. Those differences suggest there are substantial opportunities to improve the efficiency of our health care delivery system while reducing costs.\nFor example, in 2005, per-capita Medicare spending was $10,988 in Los Angeles but $6,838 in Sacramento; $14,360 in Miami, but $7,008 in Tallahassee, Fla.; $12,119 in Manhattan, but $6,556 in Rochester, N.Y.\nIf higher spending resulted in better care, this data would suggest that we need to spend more. But higher spending regions don\u2019t provide better care. Ten years of research has shown that lower spending regions of the U.S. achieve equal or better health outcomes and quality.\n(Photo: Doug Mills/The New York Times) President Obama delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.\nThe higher spending \u2014 and much of the growth in spending \u2014 is due to the provision of unneeded and sometimes harmful care: hospitalizations that could have been avoided with better primary care; frivolous specialist consults; overuse of diagnostic tests. Unnecessary care can be harmful because hospitals are dangerous places to be, especially if you don\u2019t need to be there. And having more physicians involved in your care makes it harder to know who is responsible: too many cooks can spoil the soup.\nAligning those varying costs with better health results will take time. The stimulus package, which includes nearly $20 billion to invest in electronic health records, new research programs, and preventive care, will help \u2014 especially if the standards for electronic health records are linked to a requirement that all providers within a region adopt them.\nPresident Obama, at least in the speech, was silent on some central issues: whether he would foster the development of a more integrated and organized delivery system, whether he would modify the payment system to encourage improved quality and lower costs, and whether reform will contain performance measures to reassure the public that lower costs are compatible with high quality care. He will have to answer those questions soon.\nKevin Pho, a primary care physician in Nashua, N.H. blogs at KevinMD.com.\nWith the number of the uninsured having risen to 48 million Americans, clearly the need for reform is dire. But President Obama made no mention of who exactly will take care of these patients, even if they get insurance under a successful health reform initiative.\nAs a primary care physician in southern New Hampshire, I\u2019ve been able to observe a universal coverage experiment, similar to what Congress is likely to consider,"}

They spent their excess wealth mostly on public spending, oil subsidies and wage increases.\nIn order to balance their fiscal budget, the price of the crude oil needs to be at above $100 for many Middle Eastern nations.\nAs you can see in the above IMF chart, the breakeven prices are ranging from $55 for Kuwait to $180 for Libya to balance their fiscal budgets.\nIt will be difficult for them to cut production, so in my opinion, the next stop for oil is below $50 or even at the $40 range.\nAccording to AAA, the average gas price per gallon last year was $3.301. Now, it\u2019s $2.168.\nIn 2013, the average family spent $2,418 on gasoline.\nFalling gas prices will add up to a $90 billion boost to the economy.

The next day his wife converted their daughter to Islam without Mr Tan's consent. That means both mother and child are now subject to Islamic law, which does not apply to non-Muslims like Mr Tan.\nHe is now filing for child custody through the civil court while his wife is fighting for the case to be heard in the country's Sharia court.\nThe case highlights a growing problem with Malaysia's separate judicial systems and those caught in between. Muslims are bound by Sharia law on personal matters like marriage and custody rights, while members of other faiths follow civil law.\nYet the lines become blurred when cases involve both Muslims and non-Muslims. Analysts say some disgruntled spouses are exploiting the parallel judicial system.\nThe most high profile case involved an ethnic Indian couple who were married in a Hindu ceremony. The couple separated and the father became a Muslim. Then he secretly converted his two children to Islam and obtained custody through the Sharia court.\nThe Hindu mother was also granted guardianship, but through the civil courts. After several years the case is still in the courts to determine which court has jurisdiction to hear the matter.\nIn a desperate bid to escape the Sharia court order, the mother took the two children and fled the country.\nCases such as these have sowed a feeling of distrust among some non-Muslims who feel that the 'quick conversions' of children with the consent of only one parent are being allowed by religious authorities because of a rising tide of Islamisation in the country.\nMr Tan's estranged wife, Fatimah Fong Abdullah, refused to comment on her case to the BBC, but her lawyers confirmed that the child was converted after she returned to her mother. They are fighting to have the case heard in Sharia court.\nThe Muslim Lawyers Association argues that non-Muslims can submit themselves to the Sharia court jurisdiction.\n\"It is a fallacy that the Sharia court is religious,\" vice president Abdul Rahim Sinwan said in a statement to the BBC.\n\"The court is another system which can be alternative or in fact complement the present civil system.\"\nThere is a misguided perception that non-Muslims cannot get justice in the Sharia court but there are plenty of Sharia lawyers willing to give them fair representation, said Mr Rahim.\nLaw experts say the issue stems back to 1988, when the Constitution was amended to state that civil courts cannot hear matters that fall within the jurisdiction of Sharia courts.\nThis was meant to prevent Muslims unhappy with a Sharia judge's order from running to civil courts to challenge it, but in practice many claim it has also allowed Sharia courts to expand their remit.\nAlthough government officials have said they will address the problems between Sharia and civil courts, nothing has been translated into law yet.\nIn the absence of a remedy, a Christian lawyer is now fighting to practice in Sharia courts to give non-Muslims fairer representation.\nVictoria Jayaseele Martin says she is qualified because she holds a diploma in Sharia law from the prestigious International Islamic University"}

It also has a $99 per year subscription service that lets you store a week's worth of video at a time.\nLast week, Dropcam announced it's working on a technology that can tell when a person enters your home so it can alert you via email or app notification. The person recognition can tell the difference between humans and other moving objects, which has obvious security benefits. It'll go live to subscribers later this summer.\nBusiness Insider caught up with Dropcam's CEO Greg Duffy last week to talk about the new people detection feature and how the company prepares to grow and possibly IPO.\nBelow is an edited transcription of the conversation.\nBusiness Insider: Why are you implementing people detection?\nGreg Duffy: We're thinking about Dropcam as a way for you to see what's going on at home and we want to curate that content for you since there's so much of it. The whole service takes in orders of magnitude more video than YouTube per user. We've always talked about Dropcam being more than just a hardware device. Our cloud service gets better over time. You buy your Dropcam and there are things it's going to be able to do in the future that it wasn't able to do the day you bought it. The first thing we're going to launch is enhancement to our motion detection, which is actually going to allow Dropcam to recognize people.\nBI: How does the people detection work?\nDuffy: It's a computer vision feature that we run in the cloud if you enable it on your camera. You need to be on one of our recording plans to get it. There's a huge amount of computing power that's being dedicated to doing this in the cloud. It's a really amazing way to pare down the number of alerts that you get from your camera. Imagine if you have a home with pets. You probably don't want to be alerted about your pet running in front of the camera when you're in the middle of the meeting.\nBI: How did you teach Dropcams to recognize people versus other moving objects?\nDuffy: The way we're able to do it is like all artificial intelligence or machine learning concepts. We had to provide some training data, which we're able to pull from our public featured cameras, which are only a small percentage of Dropcams. They're located all over the world and user submitted.\nBI: What are some of the most interesting things users have captured on their Dropcams?\nDuffy: It's been amazing seeing all the things people have caught. Some people have caught their kids' first steps. We've had tons of examples of people catching their kids' first steps or first words \u2014 all kinds of things they'd want immortalized. That's definitely a big use case. Also, people are catching burglars. Often, the burglars will even steal the camera, but it doesn't matter because all the video is in the cloud.

The lack of confidence is striking, but it\u2019s because the traditional telephone poll has become a creaky, expensive and outdated system for gauging Americans\u2019 preferences.\nWith cheaper, more flexible Internet polling gaining precision, this could be the phone poll\u2019s last stand \u2014 especially if the pollsters mess it up. And there\u2019s a good chance they will. The problem, simply put, is that people just don\u2019t answer their phones for pollsters anymore. The decline of landlines, prohibitions on autodialing cell phones and the proliferation of caller identification systems all contribute to the weaker response, as does a general suspicion of solicitations from strangers.\nThat\u2019s a bold statement coming from a past president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the polling industry\u2019s professional society and upholder of its standards. When The New York Times decided to work with the Internet polling firm YouGov during the 2014 campaign, the association issued a scathing critique of its abandonment of scientific rigor.\nBut efforts to forestall the inevitable haven\u2019t helped the music, newspaper or book retailing industries. Each has had to adapt, and the polling industry will too.\nThe conventional wisdom has it that the phone poll\u2019s gravest problem is that people no longer pick up for callers they don\u2019t know. And that is a big problem. When pollsters call nowadays, less than 10 percent of their calls reach someone willing to answer their questions. As recently as 20 years ago, they were successful a third of the time.\nBut the more serious threat is actually the Internet\u2019s power as a communications tool, specifically its ability to reach many more people than a telephone at a fraction of the cost.\nPolling has always been one part information gathering and one part analysis of that information. When people answered their phones, polling was more science (information gathering) than art (analysis). Now it\u2019s the other way around.\nRivers\u2019 title aside, Internet polling lacks the scientific rigor of the traditional phone poll. The best phone polls take a random sample of all phone numbers and call them. The typical Internet poll lures respondents with Web ads. The results are not a random sample.\nBut that distinction, once considered a critical differentiator between a good poll and a bad one, is fuzzier now that so few people answer their phones.\n\u201cIf you have a random sample and combine that with a 90 percent non-response rate, you now have a nonrandom sample,\u201d says Andrew Gelman, director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University and an advocate of Internet polling.\nCampaigns are already experimenting with Internet polls, if not to gauge their standing in the race, then to test advertising messages. And the political parties are looking at them as well: \u201cI don\u2019t care where we get our data as long as it\u2019s the most accurate data collection possible,\u201d says Daniel Huey, a senior adviser at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nOf course, Internet pollsters must analyze their data and make projections about voter turnout, just like phone pollsters. But they have a big advantage: They can collect vastly more data and do it cheaply.\nWith all the problems of phone polling, and the cost incentives that favor the Web, it will be tough for candidates and parties to resist the urge to switch, especially when the results are equivalent or better for the Web pollsters. And they are getting there: When polling analyst Nate Silver issued his report card for pollsters following the 2012 campaign, Internet polls"}

A weekly event series is a big undertaking that requires not only a deft balance between decompressed character moments and bigger plot machinations, but a worthwhile story at its heart. Unfortunately, writers Matthew Rosenberg, Kelly Thompson, and Ed Brisson\u2019s plotting is ultimately betrayed by advanced marketing. Is it possible to deliver a satisfying ending when readers know almost exactly where you\u2019re going to land? Meanwhile, Pere Perez\u2019s artwork feels as rushed as the conclusion, which is a shame considering the number of big moments that could have been elevated with better lineart.\nMy disappointment with this arc comes from a number of things coming to a head here. First, books by committee like this often prove to be uneven and choppy even when they do feature some good work. We see that clearly from how the Young X-Men\u2019s arc is handled across these issues - they feature into some really good character work and as a great contrast to the older generation of X-Men, until the narrative requires the focus to shift.\nWhich brings me to the next point - the threat is too undefined. Readers are at least generally familiar with X-Man, but his mission is never exactly clear. Aside from knowing that his wanting to \u201csave everything\u201d means certain doom for the planet, we aren\u2019t given distinct motivations for the character. The writers attempt to get us there in this issue by suddenly introducing the fact that Nate is dying - and using a Life Seed to maintain his vast powers - but it falls flat. While the final battle rages on, Nate and Jean Grey have this exposition-heavy discussion about why Nate started all this in the first place, but it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. Ultimately, it becomes clear that the writers don\u2019t have anything to say about this particular battle, it\u2019s just a necessary step to get us to the \u201cAge of X-Man\u201d and temporarily clear the board of most mutants for Cyclops and Wolverine\u2019s ongoing returns to prominence.\nIn a lot of ways, \u201cDisassembled\u201d is the opposite of the work done by Ed Brisson on Extermination. We knew that the Original Five X-Men would have to be removed from current Marvel Universe in order for us to move forward. But the elements of that plot weren\u2019t entirely just parallels to another story and another set of characters the way that X-Man and his Horsemen echo Apocalypse and his own minions. And Extermination had a conclusive ending that still allowed a way forward for the characters that were left. \u201cDisassembled\u201d doesn\u2019t really end - it just stops. The damage that Nate Grey has done still has to be undone. The characters in the story have not learned anything. And we, the readers, are kind of left holding the bag and asked to pick up six new limited series to get some sort of closure.\nPerez seems to suffer from the weekly format, as well. Granted, Perez didn\u2019t handle every issue of the series, but there\u2019s certainly a decline in quality. Body proportions are off across the book. Facial expression work is inconsistent at best, and some of the worst pages come at the expense of big moments - for example, when Psylocke plunges her psychic sword through Storm\u2019s head to free her from X-Man\u2019s control, Perez\u2019 foreshortening is all over the place, a problem we see repeated when Storm angrily flies back into the fray.

We should all be angry, and we should all demand answers and accountability. This is also about more than one offensive action by a minister; it is about our ability as a country to host free, fair and credible elections.\nWhen a person tries to prevent a journalist from doing their job it isn\u2019t just an act of censorship, which itself is a violation of the right to freedom of expression, it is also an act that undermines our democracy. I know we are in an election season so we can expect big claims and large promises, but think about it: preventing a journalist from reporting undermines our democracy, there can be no democracy without a free media.\nThe media has great power to shape narratives and report on our society. As a result, it has almost always been a target for interference. It\u2019s why the Nationalist Party wanted to control the SABC and other media, it\u2019s why more recently Hlaudi Motsoeneng sought to ban violent public protests from being shown on SABC and it\u2019s why the SABC 8 were threatened and harassed.\nIt\u2019s also why so many of our veteran journalists risked their lives under apartheid to tell the world what was going on. Had the world not known about the 1976 uprisings, Sharpeville, or the death of Steve Biko, it is likely international pressure may not have been as committed.\nThe media are powerful and they shoulder great responsibility, and they are often their own worst enemy, but their credibility being undermined isn\u2019t just bad for them and their reputation but for our democracy as well. However, all faults considered, the power and critical importance of our media to our democracy is as vital as free, fair and credible elections. We know that without our media, we wouldn\u2019t have a state capture commission or SARS Inquiry, among others.\nCurrently, there is a range of threats to media freedom. Disinformation, where political actors seek to spread false information with an intent to harm and undermine our elections, is one clear emerging global threat.\nWe are also entering an elections period, we know the date, but we await merely the proclamation and then one of the core exercises of our democracy builds up to take place. We know in that period that tensions rise, that parties will go all out to persuade the public to vote for them and they will use just about any means to persuade us to vote for them but also not to vote for another party.\nAs tensions build the likelihood of violence increases. We know from previous experience that, where left unchecked and unengaged, tensions can escalate and lead to the loss of life. The IEC does what it can to help ensure a stable, fair environment and parties all agree to a code of conduct to ensure they play their part too in not escalating tensions.\nThe media too have a fundamental role to play in ensuring that they ask: \u201cWhat does the public know and what do they need to know?\u201d and reporting on parties, issues and the electoral process in a manner that ensures citizens can make informed choices and thus exercise their democratic rights. Each act of violence has personal catastrophic consequences for those involved but it also undermines our democracy.\nWe thus have to address any threats to media freedom as any such threats profoundly compromise our nation\u2019s ability to ensure free, fair and credible elections"}

My son's a painter, so is my daughter, so is her husband and so is my ex wife. Actually I'm surrounded by them. But did any of these come up with a portrait? No, they did not.\nSophie Kenny, daughter of Marian Kenny, is partnered with David Uda, and guess what, he's a painter as well. When I finished building my outdoor pizza oven, barbecue and smoke house, Marian gave me a present - a portrait by David Uda, who signs himself Duda. It now has pride of place in the pizza hut (above right).\nWhich explains why my dining companion this week was David. We had the kind of drive together to get to the restaurant that can only be understood by people who have driven very old cars. My 58-year-old MGA was what we drove in and it had decided to overheat every 500 yards in heavy traffic. Eventually we took out the thermostat at the side of the road and limped to Monkstown Crescent, where I wanted to try a new arrival on the strip - Brasserie 8a.\nMonkstown Crescent is one of those places where restaurants congregate. A bit like Georges Street and its continuations, or Kinsale. You might think that having all those restaurants right next to one another would mean there'd be few diners to share, but instead the very concentration of restaurants means that there's always a lot of people looking to dine, secure in the knowledge that if they don't get into one, they'll get into another.\nWe had arrived early in the evening, so we had no trouble getting a table. As ever, we got two menus, an a la carte and an early evening set menu. The set menu had five starters, five main courses and three desserts to choose from and was priced at two courses for \u20ac22 or three for \u20ac26, which has become pretty standard now around Dublin.\nI looked down the main courses. Chicken breast stuffed with spinach and Parmesan - I don't like chicken breast. Papardelle pasta with roasted vegetables and Taleggio cheese - I don't trust non-Italian restaurants to make pasta. Belly of pork - couldn't face it again. Pan-fried sea trout - I won't eat farmed fish when we live on an island.

Despite these issues, Kickstarter has a reputation for helping people raise more money than any other site because of such high-dollar success stories like the more than $10 million raised for the Pebble watch this past May.\nIndiegogo: The main reason people choose Indiegogo is that, unlike Kickstarter, it lets you keep all the cash you raise even if you don\u2019t meet your goal. Such largesse doesn\u2019t come free: Indiegogo keeps 9% of funds raised under this \u201cflexible\u201d funding plan, plus a 2% to 3% payment-processing fee.

Photo: John Stone.\nA patch-up job is not the best long-term option for our energy needs, writes Scott Willis.\n\"Range anxiety\" is a term commonly associated with electric vehicles and the zero-emission transport evolution. However, spare a thought for pilots trying to fly jets out of Auckland.\nDamage from a digger has resulted in the only petrol, diesel and jet fuel supply line to Auckland being punctured, and range anxiety has taken on a whole new meaning. Politicians have even been riding on buses to economise. Flights have been cancelled, jet fuel rationed, motorists have been panic-buying fuel.\nOh, and by the way, that digger had apparently been excavating kauri logs in a wetland. Pause to think about that for a moment.\nWe usually take for granted the ready availability of petrol and fossil fuels. However, like the Auckland fuel supply line, our connection with fuel, for transport and industry, relies on long fragile supply chains. It also relies on general global political stability. Climate change is expected to change all that. Rationing of fossil fuels may become not a choice, but an obligation.\nMany years ago, when my partner and I were footloose and fancy free, we found ourselves on a film set in Morocco.\nAt the end of filming we hitched a ride in a beautiful 1950s Cadillac convertible to cross the High Atlas Mountains. Fuel supply was not plentiful in the Atlas Mountains and that Cadillac was a thirsty beast. It was pretty cool travelling in the convertible, up until the point we ran out of fuel.\nWe managed to roll into some sort of mountain outpost and I recall the delicate siphoning of petrol from an old Renault 4 into a plastic water bottle for transfer into the Cadillac. For the rest of the journey down into Marrakesh we coasted as much as we could, eeking out the meagre supply of petrol so we could get to our destination.\nMore recently, I recall when our two local petrol stations in Blueskin Bay were shut down. The community began searching out fuel cans and some residents were well prepared with a full jerry can just in case. But many weren\u2019t so organised and people often went asking around the neighbourhood for top-ups, or emptying the lawn-mower to recover a litre of the precious fuel. It\u2019s little wonder now that so many residents in Blueskin Bay own electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile at the international level, a bellicose and incoherent US president is demonstrably incapable of providing global leadership.\nWhile a reduction in US power doesn\u2019t necessarily mean global political instability, it certainly does mean fragility, and fragility in our political systems means fragility in our supply lines. Our civilisation relies on a fine balance of global politics in a world that is now urgently needing to adapt to climate change impacts. It is high time we built more resilient systems for energy supply, transport and all economic activity.\nOur reliance on fossil fuels for transport (to concentrate just on transport for the moment) makes us very vulnerable to international forces outside our control and global and local natural disasters. And yet we have in New Zealand an abundant potential for renewable electricity generation and the technology to fully electrify land-based transport. And that offers us opportunity and options."}

Insurers, however, also reduced their overhead for administrative expenses by $25 a year per person insured, the study found.\nHealth care providers have negotiated higher rates from insurers, which is driving up costs,' McCue said. \"Hospitals are gaining greater advantage when they go in to negotiate.\"\nThis has led many insurers, spurred by the new law, to move to new payment plans in which providers are paid by the patient rather than by the medical procedure.

Thanks for reading \u2013 goodnight!\nIn selecting Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy left by Justice Kennedy, President Trump has chosen a nominee with impeccable credentials and a strong record of upholding the Constitution. Over the course of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s impressive legal career, he has built a reputation as a fair, independent, and mainstream judge who has earned widespread respect from his peers. One of the Senate\u2019s highest constitutional responsibilities is to provide advice and consent on nominations to the Supreme Court, and I look forward to the Senate fulfilling this critical duty through a fair and thorough confirmation process.\nTrump is known to harbor suspicions about people he believes are loyal to his predecessor, George W. Bush. In the run-up to Kavanaugh nomination, some analysts predicted that the judge\u2019s tenure working for the Bush administration could be a red flag for this president as he made his decision. But clearly Trump was able to look past that.\nThe Daily Beast has some reporting on why that might be in this case.\nInteresting criticism from Michigan congressman, Justin Amash, a libertarian, who raises concerns about Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure.\nDonald Trump has named Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee for the US supreme court, lighting the fuse of an acrimonious political battle and potentially setting the court on a more conservative course for decades to come.\nThe nomination, if confirmed by the Senate, would represent one of the most consequential decisions of Trump\u2019s presidency.\nKavanaugh\u2019s record will come under particular scrutiny for clues as to how he might vote in any future review of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\nTrump\u2019s pick comes less than two weeks after Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the \u201cswing vote\u201d in the court\u2019s rulings, announced his retirement, and 18 months after he won plaudits from conservatives for appointing Neil Gorsuch to the court.\nTonight explains \u2013 at least in part \u2013 why so many conservatives have yet to abandon Trump.\nPresident Trump has made an outstanding decision in nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

By contrast, The Pale King is a Lenten exercise in self-denial, as Wallace focuses on the utterly ordinary, in microscopic detail.\nBecause Washington state now votes by mail, elections here tend to play out, at an agonizingly slow speed, over many days and, sometimes, weeks. So it was a relief when Dino Rossi, the Republican challenger, conceded to Senator Patty Murray less than 48 hours after the polls closed, with 1.8m ballots counted and around 600,000 still to come. Murray then led by 45,000 votes, just over 2 percent, which might on paper make Rossi\u2019s concession look premature. But Rossi understands the odd demographics of this state as well as anyone, and his goose looked cooked even on election night, when Murray\u2019s lead was barely 14,000.

People have been looking at this for a long time.\"\nBut Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.\nA statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".\nJonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\n\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"\nBut energy has been at the centre of previous conflict.

He said they cared only \u201cabout the business of politics, while I actually care about the people at Sports Direct\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cI do not pretend to get everything right all of the time, but I am not willing to stand idle while this company is subjected to public vilification, which is against the best interests of everybody who works at Sports Direct.\nWright declined to meet Ashley in Shirebrook, citing the \u201cselect committee\u2019s commitment to transparency\u201d.\nSeparately, a group of local MPs have pulled out of a meeting with the billionaire at the depot, which had been scheduled for Monday.\nWright said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that Mr Ashley has refused to accept the committee\u2019s reasonable request to come and give evidence in parliament, like every other witness for every other select committee voluntarily does.\nPublication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation in December added to the pressure on what was then a FTSE 100 company, and came after the retailer had previously been accused of operating \u201cDickensian\u201d working practices at Shirebrook by the union Unite.\nThe disclosures prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d and former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna to file an urgent parliamentary question, which resulted in the business minister, Nick Boles, being summoned to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal. During the debate, a succession of MPs called for HM Revenue and Customs to investigate if the company had breached minimum wage legislation.\nSports Direct responded by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency workers\u2019 terms and conditions, which was to be overseen by Ashley, who owns 55% of the retailer.\nThe company was relegated from the FTSE 100 this month after a torrid three months in which \u00a31.6bn was wiped off its stock market value amid a slump in trading at its stores.\nSteve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, said: \u201cMike Ashley\u2019s belligerent attitude to our democratically elected MPs is extraordinary and his attempts to brush off abusive work practices through bluster and insults is shameful.\nAshley claimed that his company was being publicly vilified. \u201cWe are in trouble \u2013 we are not trading very well."}

On the contrary, Ukraine\u2019s president Poroshenko widely utilized the international stage to address the world and alarm them about Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian disaster, which would have some multiplying effect on the rest of the old continent. From this standpoint, it is lucid enough to observe that the official tone regarding Russia is no longer a principal but appeasing.\nIn fact, the Georgian president, holding a number of high-level meetings in Washington DC and New York this week, shares the notion that Georgia has almost disappeared from US political radars. What is happening? What kind of pragmatic politics is Georgia in vital need of right now?\nIt is widely believed that Georgia has a significant window of opportunity for \u2018fishing in troubled waters\u2019 as the country historically failed to do back in 1801 when she joined the Russian Empire. Along with Ukraine and the highly complicated international politics, the Georgian government should be as proactive as never before in raising the issue of Russia\u2019s continued violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nWill it have a palpable aftermath? This is a strategic moment for Georgia as Russia is unable to engage its troops against Georgia along with Syria and Ukraine and, for Georgia, it is of crucial importance to buy time and considerably advance its stance in terms of de-occupation and NATO integration."}

Users, the eponymous company promised, would be able to load all of the bank and loyalty cards on to Coin, swapping them with the press of a discreet button, then swiping the card through a magnetic reader.\nIt sounds very convenient, if a little behind the times in terms of technology in days when chip, PIN and NFC are on the rise. More so because the product, which costs customers $50, was delayed: it was due out by the end of August 2014, but the launch has been postponed until 2015.\nThe timing seems a little too perfect for a competitor to arrive, especially a competitor like Plastc. Like Coin, it purports to store multiple credit and bank card information in a single card, but Plastc takes it further, able to store up to 20 cards compared to coin's eight.\nIt does this by expanding beyond that single, ageing magnetic strip and adding support for NFC, RFID and Chip and PIN -- so even in locations where NFC is not yet widely in use (Australia springs to mind, where NFC for cards has only become widespread in the last 12 months), the card is still using both existing and future technologies -- and, since Chip and PIN is expected to roll out across the US in the coming years, it goes both ways.\nPlastc's screen is also an improvement on Coin's offering: instead of a small LCD, Plastc has an E Ink strip along the bottom half of the front of the card. This means that full credit card numbers can be displayed, and it uses touchscreen technology so that you can perform a number of tasks: cycle through your cards; lock the card with a PIN; even generate QR codes and barcodes.\nFor an added layer of security, the company boasts a proximity alert that pairs your card with your smartphone; when the card gets too far from the phone, an alert will let you know that you may have left your card behind, giving you the option to set the card to \"return me\" mode or wipe it remotely.\nEach Plastc comes with a wireless charging pad and is software upgradeable, too, ensuring longevity -- at least until the next payment system comes along. It's currently available for preorder for $155 on its official website, where you can also read more about what it can do. It's slated to arrive by Q3 of next year."}

On Tuesday, he noted that \"Americans have learned it's harder to end wars than it is to begin them.\"\n\"This is how wars end in the 21st Century,\" Obama said. \"We have to recognize that Afghanistan will not be a perfect place and it is not America's responsibility to make it one.\"\n"}

Why? The arts community has expressed considerable hope that the new administration will be active arts participants, focusing the kind of attention that hasn't been seen from Washington in decades. And, indeed, according to the news release, Obama's visit is being staged \"to demonstrate her interest in and support for the arts.\"\nReally? Is that what a visit to the Met will demonstrate?\nNew York City is the nation's No. 1 tourist destination. After Times Square, the Metropolitan Museum is the city's No. 1 tourist attraction. The first lady will be doing what 4.5 million people, mostly out-of-town visitors, did last year. The city's tourism industry will surely be thrilled at the demonstration of support. But for the struggling arts infrastructure elsewhere across the nation, which doesn't rely on tourist hordes, the New York event is pretty much a snooze.\nLast month the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., opened its new American art galleries. On May 30, the Huntington Library and Art Galleries in San Marino will open its new Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art. In the fall of 2010 the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston will open its new American art wing. Yes, it's a busy 18 months for museums' historical collections of home-grown painting and sculpture. If Michelle Obama turned up at any of those ribbon cuttings, we'd certainly have some authentic evidence of arts support.\nBut at the country's leading cultural tourism destination? Not so much.\nDon't get me wrong. The Met is swell, and so is the first lady. I just think there's a message problem here.\nThe desultory gesture doesn't match significant words with savvy deeds. This particular media stunt is sort of like the president going to a Lakers game and expecting sports reporters to fall all over themselves waxing poetic about a national demonstration of support for struggling basketball. Visiting the Met is the sort of thing noted arts supporters Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan did.\nSo here's a tip for the White House Office of Media Affairs, which doesn't quite seem to understand arts support in the United States: On Monday, do not under any circumstances let Michelle Obama have a photo-op in front of that Neo-Classical marble architectural facade reconstructed inside the central court of the Met's American wing. Martin E. Thompson's Branch Bank of the United States (1822\u201324) was originally located in Lower Manhattan at 15 1/2 Wall St., and what with all the current bank bailouts and investment Ponzi schemes and millions in taxpayer-funded CEO bonuses and that $1,400 John Thain wastebasket and such -- well, you get my drift.

However, poll dates are yet to be announced.\n\u201cWe are prepared that there will be more unscrupulous things that will be done as the elections get closer.

Addressing a rally in Tripura on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah said that a regime change in Tripura had become inevitable as the CPM government had failed on many fronts.\nMeanwhile, urging the centre to reconsider and review measures which have no scope for public scrutiny in electoral funding, Yechury in his letter to Jaitley said, \u201cWe hope this conversation on electoral funding leads to a deeper debate which your government must push on introducing much needed and much more comprehensive reforms.\"\nJaitley had said in a Facebook post on Sunday that the government is willing to consider all suggestions to further strengthen the cleansing of political funding in India.\nYechury said that a clean-up would not be possible without state funding of political parties and banning corporate funding.\n\u201cThe measures you have introduced recently, I regret to say, have reversed any move towards transparent and clean political funding that may have been possible. Electoral bonds are a deeply regressive move,\" the CPM leader said.\nHe added that through electoral bonds the government has raised the prospects for allowing shell companies being set up with black money to fund political parties."}

The party conference is the only real threat facing Prime Minister Robert Hawke and his government.\nThe government has a huge lead in public opinion polls, up to 5 percent above its standing when it defeated the Liberal-National Country coalition government in March 1983. Mr. Hawke has an unprecedented 70-percent personal popularity in the polls.\nBut the Labor Party requires its politicians to be responsive to the policies of its rank and file, and the national conference can set policies even extremely popular Labor governments must obey.\nThe Hawke government has managed to ignore some policies set by the last national conference in 1982, especially economi policy, as the government moved away from Labor's traditional view that a federal government should impose tight controls on ecomonic management.\nInstead, Mr. Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating have introduced a successful regime of deregulation that has gone much further than the previous free-enterprise Liberal Party government was prepared to go. They have allowed the Australian dollar to float freely, have greatly reduced controls on banks, and have foreshadowed the entry of foreign banks into the Australian system.\nMr. Keating will argue for more freedom for the government in setting policies, but the left wing of the party will be trying to rein in the government and stop it from allowing foreign banks to be established in Australia. The left wing, which calls itself the Socialist Left, also wants to reverse government policies on uranium development and foreign affairs.\nThe uranium issue is the one on which the Socialist Left is most confident - and on which the Hawke government has indirectly acknowledged it is in the most trouble.\nCurrent Labor Party policy is to phase out uranium mining in Australia, except where uranium is a byproduct of other mineral development. This exception was designed to allow the development of the Roxby Downs mine in South Australia.\nRoxby Downs will also produce gold and copper, but its uranium is so extensive that its development would mean Australia would greatly increase its role as a uranium producer, even if it were the only uranium mine in Australia.\nThe conference vote on this issue will be very close, observers say, because many anti-mining delegates have been elected to the 99-member conference.\nOn foreign policy, the two major issues at the conference will be the existence of United States bases in Australia and relations with Indonesia.\nLast month, Hawke told the Federal Parliament the existing US bases in Australia are necessary for the Australia-New Zealand-US defense alliance. He said they contribute to nuclear control because some of them provide a way to monitor Soviet nuclear tests and any possible Soviet attacks. The Socialist Left wants to get rid of all US bases in Australia.\nForeign Minister William Hayden recently warned delegates not to ignore the realities of Australia's relations with Indonesia. He has also warned Indonesia not to ignore the problems of Labor Party policymaking.\nThe problem centers on East Timor, the former Portuguese territory which the Indonesians took over with military force in 1975. Labor has supported the right of the East Timorese to self-determination. But the Hawke government has indicated that good relations with such a close and large neighbor are paramount. Mr. Hayden is concerned that the Labor conference can tie him down to a more anti-Indonesian policy."}

Ramirez bristled with body armour, radio, gun and Taser, but before knocking on the door he adjusted just one piece of equipment: a tiny camera on his collar.\nA tubby, barefoot man with broken teeth and wild eyes opened the door. He appeared to be high. Ramirez questioned him about allegedly beating and evicting his stepson, a mentally disabled teenager. The man shifted from foot to foot and babbled about death threats.\nThe encounter, tense but polite, ended inconclusively, a routine police foray into family dysfunction \u2013 except for the fact it was all recorded. As he returned to his patrol car and next assignment, Ramirez tapped an app on his phone and uploaded the video. \"Somewhere down the line something could happen and what that guy said, his demeanour, could be evidence.\"\nRialto, a small, working-class city that bakes in the San Bernardino foothills outside Los Angeles, appeared in the films Transformers and The Hangover. Among law enforcers, however, it is becoming better known for pioneering the use of body cameras on police officers.\nOver the past year all 70 of its uniformed officers have been kitted out with the oblong devices, about the size of stubby cigars, and the results have emboldened police forces elsewhere in the US and in the UK to follow suit.\nThe College of Policing recently announced plans for large-scale trials of body-worn video in England and Wales, saying Rialto's experiment showed big drops in the use of force and in public complaints against officers. David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, has backed the idea. It follows \"plebgate's denting of public trust.\nRialto has also become an example for US forces since a federal judge in New York praised its initiative.\n\"When you know you're being watched you behave a little better.

Complaints often stemmed not from operational issues but \"officers' mouths\", said the chief. \"With a camera they are more conscious of how they speak and how they treat people.\"\nThe same applied to the public; once informed they were being filmed, even drunk or agitated people tended to become more polite, Farrar said.

The place is so insular that the ability to speak English is no longer needed to get by.\nAccording to multiculturalists, such balkanized communities existing within the United States are the diversity ideal, with no annoying assimilation to American values!\nBelow, a Muslim street in Brooklyn where there are no women or girls to be seen.\nAs a starting point, Greenfield uses the recent throat-slice murder of a successful Bangladeshi immigrant by a young tenant, a new immigrant (Tenant nearly beheaded Brooklyn landlord who had \u2018humiliated\u2019 him for being short on cash).

The presence and necessity of these forces in the human body and in the increasing use of mechanically-driven medical devices (e.g., stents, balloon catheters, gastric bands, tissue expanders) can serve as functional dynamic triggers. Therefore, this dissertation investigates the use of applied tensile strain and cyclic loading to control release of entrapped agents, and further translates the concept towards clinical applications by integrating the system with commercial medical devices that provide precise forces to trigger release. As an initial proof-of-concept, mechanoresponsive composites, consisting of highly-textured superhydrophobic barrier coatings over a hydrophilic substrate, are fabricated. The release of entrapped agents, controlled by the magnitude of applied strain, results in a graded response due to water infiltration through propagating patterned cracks in the coating. The strain-dependent delivery of anticancer agents with in vitro efficacy as well as ex vivo delivery to esophageal tissue with an integrated stent system are demonstrated. Release is further modulated by barrier coating properties. Thicker coatings afford slower release rates with preserved in vitro activity for both a chemotherapeutic and an enzyme. Localizing coating crack patterns based on different geometric stress concentration factors further controls the selective sequential release of multiple agents. Finally, the development of a reversible mechanoresponsive system is investigated to provide cycle-mediated pulsatile release. Optimization of mechanical parameters results in delivery of multiple doses. To translate this concept towards the clinic, the system is integrated with commercial balloon catheters to provide multidose delivery of small molecules to ex vivo vessels. Using the inherent inflation and deflation of the catheter to trigger release, the system enhances existing capabilities to treat cardiovascular and peripheral artery diseases. In summary, the development of mechanoresponsive systems that respond to tensile strain and cycle number are described for the delivery of a wide-range of active agents (hydrophilic and hydrophobic small molecules as well as an enzyme), and their integration with existing medical devices. Furthermore, the comprehensive range of specific kinetic profiles, including triggered release, pulsatile delivery, and the sequential delivery of multiple agents, showcases the capabilities and versatility of these dynamic mechanoresponsive systems to modulate release for the treatment of various clinical diseases."}

We want to check the inventory, are we good for that day, or week, we're a fortnight event so there's no room for error.\"\nDuring the 2014 Australian Open in Melbourne, some statistics that were recorded included that there was 35 percent spike from 2013 to 55,000 in the amount of connected devices that were used during the two week event, and the amount of twitter followers increased by 80 percent. A total of 100TB worth of storage was dedicated to the company's video assets.\nAt the same time, the amount of bandwidth that was consumed increased by 584 percent from the previous year.\n\"Arenas are becoming more connected and are providing more content to the fans. What's important here is that we try to leverage this data to better run the tournament,\" Mahir said.\nBut the ability to track fans and content would never have been possible without a proper IT infrastructure, Mahir said. To carry on the company's 21 year long relationship with IBM, Tennis Australia invested in the tech giant's dynamic cloud provisioning service to avoid the risk of their infrastructure crashing because of the numbers and content that was going in and out.\n\"We invest in cloud computing with the help of IBM because it scales. We can't pay for, for example, cloud services year around because we don't have the need for it,\" he said.\n\"So what we use is a private cloud for the event that gives us the right infrastructure, the right capacity for us, but we can also use it on demand. It can provision things automatically.\"\nMahir believes an on-demand cloud infrastructure has enabled Tennis Australia produce certain outcomes, such as customising advertisements for its partners, such as IBM, Kia, and Jacobs Creek, on its ausopen.com.au website, which averaged 467 million pageviews during the event.\nThe platform also gives a way for the organisation to analyse the social media conversations fans were having about players and make adjustments on their content accordingly.\n\"Our infrastructure on the cloud will dynamically get ready for the peaks, but once the conversation slows down it will ramp down. You need an infrastructure that will allow you to do that,\" Mahir said.\nBut Mahir said it is ongoing work as the company's next focus is trying to figure out how to retain engagement with fans and patrons post-event, which he said has not been easy."}

It would codify requirements on agencies to pursue earlier public outreach, improved scientific data, less closed door regulating, more built-in cost benefit analysis and more formal reviews of evidence of the effects of proposed \"high-impact rules\" costing more than a $1 billion.\nOn Thursday, the House voted 263-159 for the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527), which would require agencies to step up efforts to identify costs that new regulations could impose on small businesses, write the regulations in ways that reduce costs and increase input from small businesses in the process.\nA Senate version of the accountability act, introduced by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, has not emerged from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\"The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act responds to the administration's words about the need to protect small businesses from over-regulation,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"The bill makes carefully targeted reforms to the current law to ensure that agencies properly analyze how a new regulation will affect small businesses before adopting that regulation.\"\nRep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., cited several recent studies, including an October Gallup poll, that found complying with government regulations was the most important problem that small business owners faced.\n\"According to a 2010 Small Business Administration study, small firms bear a regulatory cost that is 36 percent higher than the cost of regulatory compliance for large businesses,\" said Graves, who chairs the Small Business Committee.\n\"Economic recovery begins with our small businesses, but this will not happen unless we rein in the mass of regulations coming from Washington,\" he said.\nA White House statement issued before the vote Thursday said the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act \"would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities. It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty and increase costs for businesses and further impede the implementation of common-sense protections for the American public.\"\nSimilar language was used in the White House critique of the Regulatory Accountability Act, charging that it would \"require cumbersome 'formal' rule-making for a new category of rules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings. It would impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of rule-making,\" the statement said. \"It would subject the regulatory process to unneeded rounds of litigation . . . and undermine the executive branch's ability to adapt regulatory review to changing circumstances.\nThe Obama administration argued that its \"deep commitment to promoting small business\" and relieving regulatory burdens is reflected in the president's January executive order.\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act was blasted by Scott Slesinger, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He told Government Executive it \"has nothing to do with small business but gives large businesses the opportunity to hide behind small business in analyzing the impact.\" It also would \"give the SBA power to hold up regulations, making it a super-regulator,\" he said.\n"}

In the second half, he utilized a stutter/bull rush to knock the Badgers' left tackle right back to the quarterback. He also showed off his burst/range by tracking down ball carriers from the backside.\nWhile this was one of Clowney's best games of the season, there is still plenty of room for improvement. As a front-side run defender, he continually tries to swim (arm-over move) over the top of blockers instead of shooting his hands and holding the point of attack. Also, his awareness vs. down blocks is poor and he gets washed down the line of scrimmage too often. As a pass rusher, he doesn't really have much of a gameplan. He doesn't set up moves and he plays too high at times. He relies solely on his raw speed and power.\nFor those wondering if Clowney could play outside linebacker, I don't believe that would be a good fit. He has very stiff ankles and he struggles to change direction in space. He was matched up with the Wisconsin tight end in the red zone and he looked like a fish out of water. He was called for a holding penalty and still gave up the touchdown.\nI do believe Clowney has the most potential of any player in this draft class. He has a rare combination of size, length and explosiveness. He is just scratching the surface of what he could ultimately become as a player. His overall performance this season might have failed to meet the expectations of NFL scouts and personnel executives, but I do believe he achieved the main goal he set for himself during his junior campaign -- stay healthy. Mission accomplished.\nNow the debate will begin about where he lands in the upcoming NFL draft. I don't know if he'll go No. 1 overall (Houston is desperate for a quarterback), but I will be very surprised if he isn't the first defender to be picked."}

More than a few will be fascinated to see that Robert Pollard, former leader of the disbanded indie-rock stalwart Guided by Voices, has done his first film music for this quirky drama about the doings in an Ohio doll factory.\nThe Hollywood heavy-hitter and the Ohio-based outsider have been crossing paths for some time. After Mr. Soderbergh mentioned his love for Mr. Pollard's music in an interview a few years ago, Mr. Pollard made contact. Mr. Soderbergh used a Guided by Voices song during the closing credits of \"Full Frontal,\" and he also wrote an introduction to the recently published book \"Guided by Voices: A Brief History\" (Grove Press).\nThe two finally met in 2004 when Mr. Soderbergh attended a show on the Guided by Voices farewell tour, the Electrifying Conclusion. It makes sense that Mr. Pollard would write the music for a film that is so concerned with the struggles of the everyday. As the story goes, Mr. Pollard was a Dayton, Ohio, schoolteacher in his 30's when he burst onto the independent rock scene in the early-90's, a harbinger of the home-recording style branded lo-fi.\nThere has always been a certain wide-screen quality to Mr. Pollard's music, a sense of dreaming big from unlikely circumstances. It veers with reckless abandon from sweeping, supercharged anthems to subtle, tender ballads. The music's cinematic feel was acknowledged when a recent, expanded rerelease of \"Bee Thousand,\" possibly his group's best-known album, was subtitled \"The Director's Cut.\" Mr. Pollard also wrote this couplet in his song \"Ex-Supermodel\": \"I write music for soundtracks now/ That's what I wanted to do anyhow.\"\nMr. Soderbergh, realizing a film set in Ohio lent itself to Mr. Pollard's music, initially asked for a song to go in a bar scene, but ended up using much more.\n\"I sent him a CD with about 47 new songs I had written,\" explained the prolific Mr. Pollard, whose first solo album since the breakup of the band, \"From a Compound Eye,\" was released this week. \"He kind of chose stuff he could drop in.

{"idx": "17771", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Fructose can cause behavioral changes in children with fructose intolerance.\nMany parents believe that eating any type of sugar causes hyperactivity in children, although this theory remains unproved, according to Dr. Alan Greene, a pediatrician writing on the medical-information website DrGreene.com. However, if your child has fructose intolerance, an inherited condition that makes it difficult for your child to break down and use fructose, eating foods containing fructose could cause behavioral changes. Some infants might also have behavioral changes associated with fructose metabolism. See your child's doctor if you believe he has behavioral issues associated with fructose ingestion.\nThe inherited absence of an enzyme that breaks down fructose, called aldolase B, causes fructose intolerance. When your child eats foods containing fructose, his body can't break it down into glucose, the only form of sugar that the body can use for energy. As a result, your child's blood sugar drops, a condition known as hypoglycemia. Fructose intolerance also causes toxins to build up in the liver, which can lead to chronic liver disease. Fructose intolerance can occur in mild or more serious forms.\nBoth low blood glucose levels and liver disease that occur from fructose intolerance can cause behavioral changes. Buildup of liver toxins can cause irritability and excessive sleepiness. Hypoglycemia can also cause irritability as well as tremors and jitteriness, emotional mood swings, difficulty concentrating and -- in severe cases when blood glucose levels drop to dangerously low levels -- convulsions. Avoiding foods high in fructose, including fruits and some vegetables as well as some table sugars, helps control the symptoms of fructose intolerance.\nSome infants might experience more infant colic due to their inability to absorb carbohydrates in high-fructose foods. A Miami Children's Hospital study published in the May 2002 issue of \"Pediatrics\" found a correlation between infant colic and carbohydrate malabsorption from apple juice, a high-fructose food. Infants given apple juice had a higher incidence of crying as well as an increase in physical activity and energy expenditure compared to those given grape juice, a drink lower in fructose.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup, a manmade concoction that finds its way into numerous processed foods including sodas, has come under fire for possibly contributing to behavioral issues such as autism or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, better known as ADHD. But no study has proved that HFCS specifically -- or any other sugar -- actually causes behavioral changes in children. A Norwegian study published in the October 2006 issue of the \"American Journal of Public Health\" looked at behavioral issues in teens in relation to their soda intake. The study found that teens who drank the most soda -- more than four glasses per day -- had the most behavior issues, but it also found that teens who drank no soda had more behavioral issues than those drank a moderate amount. A review of 23 available studies conducted by Vanderbilt University researchers and reported in the November 1995 issue of \"JAMA\" found no correlation between sugar intake and hyperactivity.\nChildren and teens with fructose malabsorption might have a higher risk of suffering from depression.

Miller was one of three receivers that the Eagles signed to their 10-man practice squad on Monday. Before Miller can even get into a game, the Eagles would have to promote him to the 53-man roster and release a player already on it. The Eagles play at Tampa Bay on Sunday.\nThat, in a way, represents a bigger problem for the Eagles at wide receiver as they seem to be looking long and hard at the position, making it seem like top receiver Alshon Jeffery could be at least a few weeks away from returning.\nThe Eagles reportedly plan on working out former first-round pick Breshad Perriman on Tuesday. They were also going to work out Corey Coleman, the Browns' first-round pick acquired in the Carson Wentz trade in 2016, but Coleman reportedly signed with New England on Tuesday morning.\nMiller, who's 6-foot-1, 205 pounds, is somewhat intriguing. He was the Texans' third-round pick in 2016. But in two seasons, he caught just 34 passes for 261 yards and 2 TDs, and the Texans ran out of patience.\nThe Eagles could, too, if he's not ready to contribute quickly.\nIn addition to Jeffery, Mack Hollins is on injured reserve, and would have to miss at least seven more weeks before he would be eligible to return.\nIn the meantime, Foles completed passes to just two wide receivers against the Falcons. One of the receivers was Agholor, who caught eight passes for a total of 33 yards, a paltry average of 4.1 yards per reception. The other receiver was DeAndre Carter, who's 5-foot-8; was released five times in three seasons off of practice squads; who was teaching at a middle school in Sacramento, California in 2016, thinking that his chance to make an NFL roster were pretty much over.\n\"You get cut a few times, play in a few preseason games, and you're just kind of on practice squads and things like that,\" Carter said. \"You just wait for your moment. To play in a game, make the team, is great. Getting cut is a big blow, and that can kill your confidence a little bit, you know"}

Loud chalk-stripe, a flash of red braces and the faintest whiff of a lunch-time gander at the Members\u2019 wine list. Right? Wrong.\nThe economic trauma of the crash of 2008 is demanding that just as Conservative modernisation needs to be rebooted to suit the new Age of Austerity \u2013 with a focus on bold economic reformism to tackle welfare traps, worklessness and failing schools instead of the cultural gesturism of early modernisation \u2013 so too the crisis demands a rebooted euroscepticism. The Tory Party in Parliament has been transformed by the arrival of the Cameron generation: more entrepreneurial, impatient, ambitious and global in our outlook. In our 30s and 40\u2019s, \u2018Thatcher\u2019s children\u2019 have built careers in the world transformed by the reforms of the 80s and the enterprise economics she unleashed to such effect. Today\u2019s Euroscepticism reflects that transformation. Far from the little England xenophobia of UKIP, the new generation of modern Conservative Euro-sceptics are bound by an entrepreneurial frustration at a European project which is too introverted and bureaucratic to win any Global Race.\nAs a co-chair of today\u2019s Fresh Start Conference for EU Reform \u2013 a major gathering in London of over 200 European national and business leaders from across the continent \u2013 I know that todays euroscepticism is fundamentally different to that which haunted the leaders of a previous era. The cultural and political fundamentalism of early Euroscepticism 1.0 \u2013 an implacable rejection of any loss of sovereignty to \u2018Johnny Foreigner\u2019 that might dilute \u2018Britishness\u2019 and a deep suspicion of anything \u2018European\u2019 has been replaced by a much cooler headed debate about the single market and our trading relationship with the fastest emerging markets around the world. Globalisation, the end of the Cold War, the pace of technological innovation and the collapse of the Eurozone has made eurosceptics of us all. As the Eurozone nations reconstitute the Eurozone in the wake of the banking crisis our relationship will change. This is the UK\u2019s opportunity to refashion a non-Eurozone membership which reflects our vision of being \u2018in Europe but not run by Europe\u2019.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s groundbreaking Bloomberg speech last year reflected this truth and set the tone for the new debate. Though some noisier fringe elements would suggest otherwise, it was a call that has been heeded by Conservatives up and down the country. Against the backstop of a guaranteed 2017 In Out referendum, the hard graft of turning complaints about the EU into a practical Programme for reform has started. Today\u2019s Conference is the first major step in demonstrating the Prime Minister and Conservative Party\u2019s commitment to leading the renegotiation and reform movement.

But he decided to begin with the most overused trick in any leader's rhetorical arsenal - to celebrate the military.\n\"We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.\"\nDoes the President really believe that the United States is more respected around the world because of its military activities? Did no one point out to him that the morning of his speech, the marine sergeant who led the 2005 assault on Haditha that killed 24 Iraqi civilians received no jail time for his action, same as the seven other American soldiers who were part of the raid? As the LA Times reported in the wake of the decision, \"The lack of trial convictions in the Haditha case is likely to further inflame anti-US sentiment in Iraq, as well as fuel criticism by some legal analysts of the 6-year-long investigation and prosecution.\"\nWe can thank Obama for completing the withdrawal of most troops from Iraq - he carefully said that there were no troops \"fighting in Iraq\", but there are still thousands of Americans there, training Iraqis and otherwise engaged in security-related activities.

But in the US, the uncritical celebration of the military is so strong that it clouds over its role in draining a huge share of the country's economic lifeblood away from areas where it's desperately needed or in fomenting precisely the kinds of wars and violence that have permanently eroded the view of the US around the world.

There\u2019s a search bar at the top, so you can find places your friends have visited and liked (e.g. search for \u201csushi,\u201d \u201ccoffee,\u201d \u201cgym,\u201d etc.).

That\u2019s why adding Facebook to the mix helps to provide a better view of what all your friends like and recommend. On Facebook, Vogel says there are around 10-15 places that friends have liked, on average. Combined, that leads to a lot more social data the app can access and aggregate.\nWhile the interface is appealing and simple (gotta love that Pinterest grid, right?) and all the above are some valid points, it\u2019s hard to say there\u2019s enough here to really draw users away from Facebook, Foursquare, or other preferred local recommendation apps like Yelp, Google+ Local, AroundMe, etc. While, yes, reviews can be untrustworthy to some extent, the local business reviews apps offer far more detailed information than Raved does at present. And if you\u2019re looking for a friend\u2019s recommendation to put you over the top, Foursquare has enough traction now to generally suffices, even if the active user base (those checking in and writing tips) is small.\nHowever, Raved plans to grow beyond being just a Facebook/Foursquare platform app. In the future, it will include busy news feeds of place activities pulled from those platforms as well as from Twitter, and will determine whether the local business is offering a deal or discount by aggregating from a network of local offers, deal sites, and Facebook Offers. (This also points to the business model, by the way).

The Alfa Romeo SZ.\nForeign-made cars sold in United States must conform to piles of regulations pertaining to safety and fuel emissions, at least until they're 25 years old. After that, the NHTSA tells us, it can be lawfully imported \"without regard to whether it implies\" with all those rules. So whenever a new year begins, gearheads like us look back 25 years for formerly forbidden cars to import.\nNow is a good time to look back, because in the late 1980s, European and Japanese cars were on a roll. The styling may clash with current tastes, but it was the era when turbocharged engines were taking off, cutting fuel consumption to make regulators happy and cranking out more power to please everyone else. The end of the decade saw the birth of the exorbitantly expensive and awesome Ferrari F40 that offered nearly 500 horsepower. Nissan's R32 Skyline, the third generation GT-R, had a turbocharged engine that represented a leap forward in performance. The Lancia Delta HF Integrale was the terrific production version of the four-wheel drive hot hatch that dominated the World Rally Championship in the late 80s and early 90s.\nThen there's the 1989 Alfa Romeo SZ. The Italian-styled two-door makes up for its plastic body style (let's be honest, it looks like a doorstop) with a sonorous engine note and 210 horsepower. The 3.0-liter V6 and rear-mounted gearbox are set up for weight distribution that rewards enthusiastic driving. Because it shares many parts with the Milano sedan that Alfa briefly sold here, you may not be totally screwed if it breaks down on an American road.\nOnly 1,000 SZs were built, so it's hard to find one for sale (we haven't yet). If you get lucky, you get the guarantee that no one else on the block will have one. Bonus: The SZ was also called \"Il Mostro,\" which is Italian for \"awesome\" (\"monster,\" actually).\nIf red paint and old-fashioned Italian unreliability aren\u2019t for you, the tuner-favorite R32 Skyline is also now fair game for import.

The prominent video game voice actor has seemingly confirmed that developer Naughty Dog is working on some sort of follow-up to its critically acclaimed game, The Last of Us. If you haven't played that game, beware: spoilers ahead.\n\"For now I know they're doing The Last of Us 2, but my character in Last of Us kind of met an untimely demise.\" That was North's response to an audience question posed during a panel at the recent Metrocon anime convention.\nIn a completely unrelated appearance, The Last of Us star Troy Baker was asked a similar question during a panel at Indy PopCon (via Polygon). He claimed to be unaware of any sequel plans, seemingly contradicting North's statement.\n\"Okay, so I'm\u2014 and by the way, I know nothing. I don't know if we're gonna do another one or not,\" Baker said. \"If we do, then I trust [creative director Neil Druckmann] and [game director Bruce Straley] and everyone at Naughty Dog to tell a story that needs to be told.\"\nNorth is the longtime star of Naughty Dog's Uncharted games, and with the series' fourth console release in development, he's likely visited the studio more than a few times in recent months. His statement is difficult to misread (hear it for yourself right here) and undeniably definitive: Yes, they are doing this thing.\nOf course, North's character is dead, and a Last of Us sequel \u2014 direct follow-up or not \u2014 very likely wouldn't include him. That means any info North has is probably based on what he's seen as a Naughty Dog visitor, and not as an active participant in the game.\nBaker, on the other hand, is a likely candidate to return for The Last of Us 2, assuming the game is some sort of direct sequel. If he is involved, then he's almost certainly bound by non-disclosure agreements. That would explain his apparent hedging in the above quote (listen right here).\nThere are lots of \"ifs\" and informed speculation here. North could be completely wrong; even if he's right, Baker might not be involved. The Last of Us 2 could be a direct sequel or an in-universe spinoff, or it could be nothing more than a misunderstanding.\nHere's a question: what do you want, The Last of Us fans? Do you feel like a sequel \u2014 direct follow-up or not \u2014 is really warranted? You played through the game; you know where things are at with Joel and Ellie, the two protagonists. Do you think there's more story to tell there?\nWe've reached out to Naughty Dog for comment and will update accordingly when we hear back."}

Solorzano said supplies were scarce amid the Contra war and a US economic embargo.\n\u201cTo get the caps of the bottles we had to bring them from Poland. The bottles we used to buy from Cuba because of the embargo and the lack of dollars and everything,\u201d he said.\nThen in 1986, the Sandinista government confiscated the sugar mill that supplied the molasses needed to make the rum. Fearing the entire business could be seized, Flor de Ca\u00f1a\u2019s managers began stashing barrels of rum in neighboring Honduras and other places.\n\u201cWith that threat in our head we started to produce a lot of alcohol, the most possible quantities, and we moved this alcohol to secret places just in case we were confiscated,\u201d Solorzano said.\nAfter the Sandinistas were voted out of office in 1990, Flor de Ca\u00f1a got its sugar mill back. And because so many barrels had been hidden, the company has one of the world\u2019s largest supplies of aged rum.\nThat would\u2019ve been no big deal a few decades ago. But now the appetite for high-quality rum is growing, like the popularity of single-malt whiskey. Most rum is aged just a few years; Flor de Ca\u00f1a also sells bottles of 12, 18 and 21-year-old rum.\nOnce the war ended, the company began an aggressive marketing campaign to export Flor de Ca\u00f1a. But from the company\u2019s perspective, something was missing. Nicaragua lacked a national drink.\n\u201cCuba has their mojito, Brazil has their caipirinha. If you are in Vietnam and you try to make a cocktail like a Margarita you are thinking Mexico,\u201d said Solorzano.\nSo five years ago, the company sponsored a contest that led to the creation of the Macua \u2013 it\u2019s rum mixed with orange, lime and guava juice. The Macua\u2019s another way Flor de Ca\u00f1a\u2019s trying to boost sales.\nBut after the initial excitement over the national drink, the demand for the Macua has died down.\nAt a sports bar in Managua, waiter Reynaldo Guerrero said it\u2019s been three months since anyone ordered a Macua. He said Nicaraguans prefer traditional cocktails, like margaritas and pi\u00f1a coladas.\nBut at the Flor de Ca\u00f1a distillery, no one seems especially concerned about the fate of the Macua. Rum-making tours are on the rise amid a boom in tourism, and the company\u2019s building a Flor de Ca\u00f1a museum and theme park.\nAnd employees claim their rum is so good you don\u2019t need to mix it with anything."}

But when it comes to global public opinion toward Russia, much of the world has unfavorable or mixed views, according to our spring 2013 Global Attitudes survey.\nPeople in only nine of 38 countries surveyed say they have a positive view of Russia \u2014 and among those, in only two of them do half or more of the population have a favorable opinion. Coincidentally, the most positive views of Russia hail from the birthplace of both the ancient and modern Olympic games, Greece (63% favorable). Russia also gets moderately positive views from close neighbors South Korea (53%) and China (49%).\nIn 12 of the 38 countries, views of Russia are mixed. In Canada, one of the strongest perennial contenders for Winter Olympic gold and the most recent host of the games, 42% have a favorable view of Russia and 39% have an unfavorable opinion. In the U.S., another strong medal competitor, only 37% see Russia in a favorable light while 43% express a negative opinion.\nIn the remaining 17 countries, opinions toward Russia are decidedly negative, especially in Europe and the Middle East. In Europe, negative views are shared by 64% of the French, 60% of Germans, 56% of Italians, 54% of Poles, and 51% among Czechs and the Spanish. Among Middle Eastern publics, opinions are even worse, with seven-in-ten or more in Israel (77%) and Jordan (70%) holding a negative opinion of Russia.\nIn addition, 64% in Japan have an unfavorable view of Russia, which might not be surprising considering the continuing dispute over the Kuril Islands and the fact that the two nations never formally ended World War II.\nOverall, a median of 36% across 38 countries see Russia in a favorable light, while 39% see Russia negatively. However, there is a bright spot for Russia\u2019s global image: young people.

I think the character is better served to remove this destructive energy around it.\"\nIn an interview on Monday, Whitmire said he was fired over character notes he gave during the short-lived ABC Muppets reboot and for a union issue. \"I have been outspoken about what's best for the Muppets since the Muppets came to Disney, but the fact is I have respect for everyone who was involved in the creation of that series for their own particular contributions,\" Whitmire said. Disney and The Muppets Studio responded that they did not come to their decision lightly and that the actor's conduct had been unacceptable for a long period of time.\nThe conflict between the studio and the puppeteer may have been simmering for years, but it hadn't always been that way. It was Brian Henson, along with his late mother, Jane, who picked Whitmire to take over as Kermit following his father's untimely death in 1990.\n\"Nobody worked harder than me on making sure Kermit survived my father's death and retained his cathartic personality and presence. So I understand the fans being concerned,\" Henson said. However, Henson said he had to have numerous talks with Whitmire over the years about his unprofessional conduct, which included \"appalling\" communications with colleagues.\nDespite being a fantastic technical puppeteer and impersonator, Henson said Whitmire made \"outrageous demands and often played brinkmanship,\" which he was warned as far back as the mid-1990s needed to stop. Henson declined to go into specifics about Whitmire's exact demands, but did say, \"Steve would use 'I am now Kermit and if you want the Muppets, you better make me happy because the Muppets are Kermit.' And that is really not OK.\"\nWhitmire previously told THR he always handled himself in a respectful manner, even when disagreeing with others on the direction of Kermit. \"I didn't yell, or call anyone names, or refuse to do my job. I just gave lots of definitive notes via emails to this small group about character integrity and always tried to offer alternative solutions,\" he said Monday"}

Those are the only entrance requirements. But once in the program, every graduate has gone on to attend college. Some plan to go back to their communities to teach.\nLast Tuesday, a small group of state officials went to see this work of educational wonder in action. The group included three state representatives, Leo Daughtry, a Smithfield Republican who has championed the program from its start; Craig Horn, a Union County Republican who co-chairs a House subcommittee on education; and Michael Wray, a Northampton County Democrat. Also on hand was June Atkinson, the state superintendent of public instruction.\nThe representatives were drawn to the entrepreneurial style of the program and the big results it produces with only about $180,000 in state funding.\nHorn asked Chen \u2013 a co-director of the program, a Princeton graduate and a UNC doctoral student \u2013 to tell him what they need from the state to grow. Chen said the program still had to develop locally before it could be taken up to a statewide scale.\nAnd in that, it became clear that beyond the bright light of one program was the gloom of how many children are being missed. Those kids won\u2019t be coming to Durham for a taste of high-quality education. The state will have to bring it to them.\nAfter the presentation, Atkinson said in an interview that the program is a testimony to its founders\u2019 dedication and its students\u2019 desire, but there will be no miracle cures to educating children in low-income rural areas. Even as the ENC STEM program shows the potential of such students, it also highlights the need for more help. These students may spend a week in the wonderland of the School of Science and Mathematics, but they will go back to schools that are ill-equipped and have the highest turnover in the state of both teachers and principals.\nRural school districts throughout much of Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina lack the tax base to pay teachers well, attract top administrators or fully equip their schools with technology and support staff.\nThe state must do that, but under Republican leadership it is avoiding that burden. Instead, lawmakers are looking to charter schools, vouchers and virtual charters and having school systems rent their buildings from private contractors. The state continues to be near the bottom in teacher pay and in per-pupil funding.\nIf Horn wants to know what he can do to expand the good work ENC STEM is doing, he could start by taking back tax cuts that are costing the state $1 billion a year and put that money into public schools."}

However, a statement from LU secretary Gordon Rowntree says the PCS Democrats will not accept Chris Baugh, so he will not be the Democracy Alliance candidate.\nChris will be put forward separately as the LU candidate despite LU conference instruction to agree a full joint slate with the Democrats. Even this was only grudgingly conceded by Rowntree.\nPCS Democrats' base of support among the union's membership is far smaller than Left Unity's.\nDisgracefully, Rowntree seeks to justify the position of Socialist View and the Socialist Workers' Party (SWP), who hold a majority on LU's national committee, by stating that some LU members, including apparently the SWP, have said they are \"not willing to support Chris as AGS\".\nWhether any individual LU members support Chris or not, he is the elected LU candidate for AGS. LU rules require them to recommend and campaign for all LU agreed candidates.\nChris Baugh has been the elected AGS since 2004, having stood successfully as LU candidate three times. He has an outstanding and unmatched record, over 40 years as a left lay activist and elected senior full-time officer.\nPCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka is backing full-time official Lynn Henderson. Henderson is not a LU member and has made no contribution to building LU or democratising the union.\nOver the last 18 months the campaign against Chris, initiated by Mark Serwotka, has failed to impress. The current claim is that Chris does not support the union's national pay campaign. This allegation is a complete lie.\nChris has always been clear: \"I will support and fight for the union's national pay campaign, as I have always done.\" Chris Baugh's only 'crime' has been to call for an open and full debate on the strategy, not ruling anything out, to win the 2019 pay campaign, for which he has simply put forward some tactical suggestions.\nThe SWP described the 2005 pensions deal as \"shabby\", but said they would continue to work with Mark Serwotka as \"honest debate over issues is not a barrier to this, it is essential.\" Now Gordon Rowntree says the SWP will not support Chris.\nWe reject these divisive and undemocratic manoeuvres by the LU national committee majority. But we must not allow frustration and anger with these antics to distract from the fight to re-elect Chris Baugh and secure the re-election of the Democracy Alliance national executive committee slate.\nChris Baugh is the LU candidate for AGS, the LU national committee and all LU members must campaign for his election."}

Activists groups like Lancaster Against the Pipeline argue the gas is intended for export at the Cove Point Liquid Natural Gas terminal.\nSince that original notification, the proposed pipeline route has been altered dozens of times, and is currently awaiting approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\nOn Sunday, the nuns will be joined by the Sisters of Loretto, a Kentucky-based Catholic order that led a successful campaign against a Williams pipeline in 2014."}

{"idx": "17824", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The second quarter brought few surprises, as the children's media producer continued to integrate Strawberry Shortcake and Peanuts into its operations.\nDHX Media (NASDAQ:DHXM) reported earnings Tuesday morning, covering the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The maker and distributor of children's content and related brands delivered steady sailing toward its full-year targets, including strong results from recently acquired brands.\nData source: DHX Media. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles.\nWhat happened with DHX Media this quarter?\nOut of DHX's $122 million in top-line sales, 68% -- or $82.9 million -- came from the company's existing brands, for a 5% organic year-over-year increase. The rest sprung from the $345 million acquisition of Peanuts and Strawberry Shortcake, which closed in the summer of 2017.\nConsumer products sales landed at $42.7 million, up from $36.2 million in the first quarter and $8.3 million in the year-ago period. Strawberry Shortcake pulled her weight in this surge, but Peanuts delivered the bulk of these gains. Consumer products accounted for 40% of DHX Media's revenue in the first half of 2018, up from 17% for the same period in 2017.\nSynergies between content creation, distribution to global TV networks, and related consumer goods sales are boosting DHX's cash generation. Free cash flow stopped at $5.9 million in the second quarter, compared to cash losses of $10.7 million in the year-ago period and $32.4 million in the first quarter.\n\"We remain on track to achieve our targeted annualized savings from the Peanuts integration and companywide cost-reduction program,\" said DHX Media CEO Dana Landry in a prepared statement. \"Management remains focused on growing both revenues and cash flow, as we deliver on our commitment to de-lever.\"\nThe company is exploiting the Peanuts portfolio around the world, signing co-branding partnerships with household names like Levi's and Nordstrom in the second quarter. Snoopy-themed store-in-store displays will pop up in Nordstrom locations to tie into the Chinese New Year -- it's the Year of the Dog, after all.\nIn keeping with that China-based promotion, DHX signed a distribution deal with Chinese digital media giant Tencent that will put 450 half-hour episodes on Tencent's Chinese streaming video services.\nBased on the progress of the second quarter, DHX Media's management simply reiterated its financial goals for fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, the company aims to produce adjusted EBITDA profits of roughly $140 million this fiscal year, or $60 million of free cash flow. These targets are heavily weighted toward the back half of the fiscal year, since free cash flow stands at a negative $26.6 million through the first two quarters."}

Sure we\u2019ve still got a long way to go, especially when it comes to the ethics and safety behind them, but there\u2019s no changing the fact that they will go into mass production in the very near future. Heck, you only need to look at the fact that an autonomous car just crossed to the continental United States to see just how close we are.\nBut how will market for self-driving cars evolve once they do arrive? Will human drivers eventually become illegal, as Elon Musk predicts? Or is Bosch\u2019s vision of drivers switching between autonomous and manual modes closer to the mark?\nWell those are difficult questions to answer. Especially when, as a new report from The Boston Consulting Group suggests, there are still significant obstacles to overcome before autonomous cars become economically viable.\nIndeed, it\u2019s the need for economic caution as much as technological limitations which is likely to see autonomous driving technology rolled out in phases rather than all at once.\nThe Boston Consulting Group reckons the first autonomous feature to become available will probably be the single-lane highway autopilot, with Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned introduction in mid-2015, followed by GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of the feature, called Super Cruise, which will appear in 2016 on an all-new Cadillac vehicle.\nBy 2017, the management consulting group says, AVs capable of traffic jam autopilot and autonomous valet parking should be on dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lots, followed by highway autopilot with lane changing in 2018. Vehicles capable of urban autopilot could be ready in 2022, paving the way for fully autonomous vehicles by 2025\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe year when Mercedes, for one, expects to debut its first full autonomous model (which presumably will look something like at the F-015 it showed off at CES earlier this year).\nThat said, new entrants from the technology sector could accelerate that timeline and speed up adoption.\nIn developed markets at least, the opportunity for manufacturers and tech providers seems pretty significant.\nBoston Consulting Group conducted a study of 5 000 US drivers which shows that more than 50% of consumers would likely buy a partially self-driving car, and more than 40% would buy a fully self-driving vehicle. A further 17% said they would pay that much for multiple features, including urban autopilot and self-parking. Consumers in other markets, such as China, Germany, and Japan, would be willing to pay even more, the group claims.\nOf course, saying you\u2019ll do something and actually doing it are two very different things. And as we\u2019ve written previously, all the will in the world won\u2019t bring autonomous driving infrastructure to countries that can barely feed their own populations never mind implement proper safety standards.\nIf manufacturers are looking to get into the autonomous car game though, it does seem they\u2019re better off spending their money in some areas than others.\nWhile it seems unlikely that autonomous cars will totally destroy car ownership, they could disrupt it in a big way. If a company like Uber, which has already seen a small number of people ditch their cars, believes that it will eventually replace its drivers with robo-cabs, then what\u2019s to stop the general population doing the same? That\u2019s something that\u2019ll likely be especially true of people who don\u2019t see the sense of owning something that\u2019s parked "}

The 62-year-old German-born professor, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the philosopher John Rawls, is bespectacled and slight of stature. But he\u2019s a giant in the field of global ethics, and one of only a small handful of philosophers who have managed to translate prominence within the academy to an influential place in debates about policy.\nA self-identified \u201cthought leader,\u201d Pogge directs international health and anti-poverty initiatives, publishes papers in leading journals, and gives TED Talks. His provocative argument that wealthy countries, and their citizens, are morally responsible for correcting the global economic order that keeps other countries poor revolutionized debates about global justice. He\u2019s also a dedicated professor and mentor, at Yale University \u2014 where he founded and directs the Global Justice Program, a policy and public health research group \u2014 as well as at other prestigious institutions worldwide. By Pogge\u2019s own count, he\u2019s taught 34 graduate seminars, given 1,218 lectures in 46 countries, and supervised 66 doctoral dissertations.\nBut a recent federal civil rights complaint describes a distinction unlikely to appear on any curriculum vitae: It claims Pogge uses his fame and influence to manipulate much younger women in his field into sexual relationships. One former student said she was punished professionally after resisting his advances.\nPogge did not respond to more than a dozen emails and phone calls from BuzzFeed News, nor to a detailed letter laying out all the claims that were likely to appear in this article. Yale\u2019s spokesperson, Thomas Conroy, declined to comment.\nThe allegations against Pogge are an increasingly open secret in the international philosophy community, an overwhelmingly male field in which, many women say, pervasive sexual harassment is an impediment to success. But for the first time, confidential documents obtained by BuzzFeed News reveal the extent of the claims against Pogge.\nIn the 1990s, a student at Columbia University, where Pogge was then teaching, accused him of sexually harassing her. In 2010, a recent Yale graduate named Fernanda Lopez Aguilar accused Pogge of sexually harassing her and then retaliating against her by rescinding a fellowship offer. In 2014, a Ph.D. student at a European university accused Pogge of proffering career opportunities to her and other young women in his field as a pretext to beginning a sexual relationship.\nYale has known about these allegations, and others, for years. When Lopez Aguilar first reported Pogge for sexual harassment, she said, Yale offered to buy her silence with $2,000.\nEventually, a hearing panel did find \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Pogge had acted unprofessionally and irresponsibly, noting \u201cnumerous incidents\u201d where he \u201cfailed to uphold the standards of ethical behavior\u201d expected of him. But the panel voted that there was \"insufficient evidence to charge him with sexual harassment,\" according to disciplinary records.\nMore recently, Yale received letters from concerned professors and students at other institutions providing further evidence of Pogge\u2019s alleged misconduct and asking Yale to reinvestigate. But Yale said those allegations were outside of its jurisdiction and that it would not reopen the case. Pogge is still at Yale, directing the Global Justice Program and teaching philosophy and international affairs classes on the New Haven, Connecticut, campus"}

Futuristic materials and innovative technology are married with classic style and comfort for a shoe that is not only durable, but also works and looks great.\nAVE is a powerhouse skateboarder and has shown durability with a long career.

The shell of the shoe is constructed of a welded material that is lightweight and dense, sort of like a climbing shoe. On the shoe\u2019s toe box and along the side where you flip your foot, you\u2019ll find the company\u2019s patented Duracap upper reinforcements.

I don\u2019t skate everyday, but I skate a lot, and though I don\u2019t do a ton of flip tricks per se I always would wear down shoes in the toe box and along the foot from just ollie-ing.\nWhen you skate a lot, you also tend to wear through the soles of the shoes, and in that way I don\u2019t know that the AVE Rapidwelds are going to last any longer than traditional skate shoes. But, I bet I won\u2019t blow out the toe before then.\nIf you\u2019ve got a little coin to spend and want to turn some heads with the newest in skate shoe innovation, these shoes are your ticket. They\u2019re incredibly light, incredibly durable and incredibly sharp looking \u2014 they just have a great feel.

For some time, the keyboard was restricted to simply the word processor and the computer. It took a while for mobile devices to take advantage of the QWERTY keyboard style on handsets.\nHowever, innovative technologies allow a wider breadth of input into computers and mobile devices. But even with touch technology, arguably spurred on by tablets and touch-screen phones like the iPad and iPhone, the keyboard still reigns as the most natural and innate input device for all to use.\nWhen the technology was founded: Microsoft Office was first released in fall 1990 for Windows 3.0.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: Without doubt, Microsoft Office is one of the most used, and understandably the most expensive office and productivity suite of programs on the market. Because of its userbase in the hundreds of millions, ranging from large corporations to governments, it is almost as widely used as Windows itself.\nBut the one thing that hinders it the most is that bar the Office:mac edition, it only runs on the Windows platform. As so many people use Office as a document standard, it all but forces out competitors as its market dominates further.\nThere is a good reason why it has become what it is. Not only does it dole out everything that one needs in an office suite, but has always maintained its version history to each major release of the platforms it is supplied on; both Windows and Mac OS X.\nOffice will, in my opinion, no doubt survive for the next 20 years on any platform that Windows becomes or evolves into.\nWhen the technology was founded: 19th century, part of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine.\nWhy the technology will be around for another 20 years: To put it simply and bluntly, how else would we get stuff out of the computer?\nPrinters are absolutely vital to our everyday living and working. Without them, there would be no such thing as a 'papertrail' and there would be nothing to screw up in a moment of frustration to throw at your co-workers.

The study was published Wednesday in the journal Menopause.\nWhile it is unclear how age correlates to postmenopausal women developing the disease, the authors theorize that it may be influenced by declining estrogen levels.\nAs estrogen levels drop for woman entering menopause her appetite increases, fat accumulates and her metabolism slows.\nBased on the physiological challenges that decreased estrogen levels present, the study\u2019s lead author Erin LeBlanc explained that postmenopausal women must remain vigilant of lifestyle changes that could further increase their risk of contracting type 2 diabetes.\nBesides declining estrogen levels, the study also discovered an association between the length of a woman\u2019s lifetime reproductive cycle \u2014 the time between a woman\u2019s first period and menopause \u2014 and her risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court decision that landed Rodney Galimore in prison, after a jury found him guilty of reckless homicide, driving under suspension, child endangerment and felony DUI. Galimore started his 35-year sentence in 2008.\nPolice said on the night of the wreck Galimore had pistol whipped his girlfriend after she broke up with him at her child\u2019s birthday party in her Poplar Court home. Police said he had been drinking before he drove away and struck and killed Ridgeland motorcyclist Merry Deon on S.C. 46. at 10:45 p.m.\nGalimore had turned near the Country Store parking lot in Pritchardville and in front of Deon. The 42-year-old woman was on her way home after working at the Bluffton Lowe\u2019s after starting her day working security at Long Cove Club on Hilton Head Island, according to Savannah Morning News and Bluffton Today articles.\nIn 2007 Galimore was indicted by a Beaufort County grand jury on the four charges. But the indictment was tossed out because the trial court said the state\u2019s allegations had missed a key element for a felony DUI charge \u2014 namely a specific \u201cact forbidden by law\u201d at the center of the case, according to the state\u2019s final brief.\nThe state tried again. And in 2008 Galimore was re-indicted for felony DUI, with the indictment alleging Galimore had broken the law by driving on the wrong side of the roadway when he struck Deon in an SUV that also contained his two children.The jury found Galimore guilty on all four charges.\nCircuit Judge John Hayes sentenced him to 25 years for felony DUI, 10 years concurrent for reckless homicide, 10 years consecutive for child endangerment, and six months concurrent for driving with a suspended license, according to a final brief.\nGalimore appealed last November. And on Wednesday, the S.C. Court of Appeals upheld the decision.\nGalimore had argued that he performed a legal U-turn when he hit Deon.\nBut a highway patrol officer explained how the debris found in the road showed Galimore was on the wrong side of the roadway.\n\u201cHere\u2019s your pool of sand and debris, and as you can see the tire mark that goes out it never established the correct lane,\u201d said trooper Nick Sprouse, according to court records.\nIn 2008, the Sheriff\u2019s Blog on the Beaufort County Sheriff\u2019s Department website featured Galimore\u2019s case to highlight how too much pre-trial publicity can affect the trial process. It noted how some potential jurors were dismissed because they had read newspaper coverage of Galimore\u2019s prior arrests, which were not admitted in court. The wreck was Galimore\u2019s third DUI since September of 2005.\nReach Sarita Chourey at sarita.chourey@morris.com or 803-727-4257."}

And Georgia voters gave former State House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams a shot to become the first black, female governor in the country.\nFor Democrats, the results marked a reassertion of the party\u2019s fealty to the rising American electorate \u2014 unmarried, young and racially diverse voters. The Democratic contention that it is the party of the future was muddled in 2016 by a presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who first arrived in the White House 23 years earlier and campaigned to continue the policies of the sitting president.\nNow, Democratic primary voters are looking to candidates who claim to embody the changing face of American politics.\nThe dynamic shaping Democratic races was not driving contests on the other side, as Republican primaries revolved more on ideological purity, fidelity to President Donald Trump and defiance against Washington political leaders.\nIn GOP primaries Tuesday in Texas and Georgia, candidates who promised to support the president and crack down on illegal immigration triumphed.\nThe victory for McGrath in Kentucky\u2019s 6th District delivered a second defeat in two weeks for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Another first-time female candidate, Kara Eastman, won the nomination for Nebraska\u2019s only competitive House race last week, over the DCCC\u2019s chosen candidate, former congressman Brad Ashford.\nBut those successes also carry some risk, putting the Democrats\u2019 fate into untested hands. Indeed, Republicans jumped on both defeats for the Democratic establishment an example of liberals putting forward a weaker general election candidate.\nDemocratic strategists say they feel good about McGrath\u2019s chances in Kentucky, despite having recruited her rival to the race. Internal party polling conducted before the primary gave McGrath a lead over Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr, R, in a district that Trump won by 15 points in 2016.\nBut claims to electability and debates over policy positions have not been the driving forces in many of the Democratic primary races.\nIn Arkansas\u2019s only competitive House race, state Rep. Clarke Tucker defeated several more liberal candidates after running campaign ads that focused on his own battle to overcome cancer. In Georgia\u2019s 6th District \u2014 where Rep.

Even the reference to the Permanent Commission against Corruption suggests that we are talking about intrinsic shortcomings that have been in place for literally decades.\nIndeed, the GRECO report tells us more about our national reluctance to ever confront these issues, than about the issues themselves.\nIt notes the ceremonial role of the President, whose powers listed in the Constitution are exercised vicariously through the supremely more potent role of Prime Minister, including the dissolution of the House of Representatives on the basis of the advice of the Prime Minister. Most members of constitutional bodies are likewise appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister: including the Attorney General, judges and magistrates, members of the Public Service Commission, the Broadcasting Authority, and the Employment Commission.\nThe power to make appointments to public offices, and to remove and to exercise disciplinary control over such persons, also rests with the Prime Minister.\nIt is immediately noticeable that this coincides with a political culture of \u2018leader-worship\u2019 in Malta. If Maltese prime ministers enjoy the plenipotentiary status of the kings and emperors of old\u2026 it is in part because we, as a people, have always lionised (and demonised) our Prime Ministers along similar lines.\nEven if the aura of raw power exuded by Dom Mintoff, and later Eddie Fenech Adami, has been somewhat diluted in recent years, there can be no doubt that the leadership cult still dominates Maltese politics today. Consider, for instance, the speculation surrounding Joseph Muscat\u2019s possible replacement when (or if) he steps down by 2020, as indicated.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to state that many (if not all) of the report\u2019s other conclusions are symptoms of the same cause. For instance, the document highlights the ineffectual conduct of supervisory bodies which are \u201cof little use\u201d since these themselves are \u201cunaccountable and/or ineffective\u201d given that they depend heavily on the government\u2019s authority.\nThe reality, as indicated in this report, is that the balance of power was all along designed to ensure that the Prime Minister of the day retains the final say on any legislative decision.\nNowhere is this situation better evidenced than in the degradation of the natural environment. Despite the existence of numerous State regulators to safeguard the landscape, it is ultimately government\u2019s agenda of \u2018economic growth at all costs\u2019 that calls all the shots: with authorities like the PA and ERA merely rubber-stamping the decisions.\nIt should not really surprise us that this unwholesome situation \u2013 which we have all tacitly accepted, and sometimes encouraged through our unconditional support (if"}

Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller addressed the UN Security Council on July 30, 2015 on security threats facing Jamaica and small Caribbean states.\nIT WAS one of her better-delivered speeches and the message was clear. As the prime minister of Jamaica, Portia Simpson Miller, was making the call for \"comprehensive debt relief for Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) that would gradually write off 100 per cent of their multilateral debt stock\" from the podium of the Security Council at the United Nations..\nShe went on to say she believes the call for such a write-off \"is timely\".\n\"In our view,\" the prime minister said, \"this proposal is worthy of serious consideration and support from the international community\".\nHer message was clear but some believe what she labelled as a 'timely' call showed, in some observers' view, awful timing. Two weeks ago, her minister of finance tapped the eurobond market for US$2 billion, while earlier this week, the board of one of our largest multilateral donor, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), was being approached to extend the largest loan to Jamaica since 2010.\nSo what is her message to Jamaica's lenders from the podium of the Security Council?\nThe country head of IDB disclosed, in a radio interview earlier this week, that her institution has an exposure to Jamaica which exceeds US$900 million. If this week's requested amount of US$130 million is granted, it will push that Jamaican exposure to more than US$1 billion. So the head of the Jamaican Government, Portia Simpson Miller, is saying lend us your money, IDB, but I'm putting you on notice that we want you to write it off as 'debt relief'.\nRegardless of their public compliments for the costly PetroCaribe buy-back bond deal - they had no choice, so their compliments focused on the debt-reduction angle of the transaction, which is their agenda and mantra - officials of the three multilaterals must have had raised eyebrows after hearing so public a call for debt relief from the prime minister. Both the IMF and World Bank have near-similar loan exposures to Jamaica of about US$500 million each.\nIf the multilaterals followed diplomatic decorum and raised only eyebrows while masking disquiet with their silence, the executives of some institutional bondholders and private investors would have exclaimed in expletives that would have had to be deleted. They are the ones who hold the vast majority of the approximately US$15-billion debt stock Jamaica has in the bond market.\nThe prime minister's speechwriters tried their best to couch the revolting thought - absolutely revolting to lenders - in graciously careful language. They also exerted obvious effort to ring-fence the offence to the books of the multilaterals.\nNo luck with that effort. When a country's prime minister uses the terms 'comprehensive debt relief' and 'write off 100 per cent of their multilateral debt stock' on the podium of the United Nations Security Council, everyone listens! And when the multilaterals have such a relatively small portion of Jamaica's oversized debt bundle, the private firms and investors begin to fear if they are next on the 'write-off' list.

With blood, you can only donate once every eight weeks, while plasma can be donated much more often.\nBelieve it or not, there's a large market out there for breast milk as well. Sometimes, moms who are overproducing can offer their milk for as much as $2.50 per ounce, according to this 2011 Wired article.\nThen there are more personal decisions. Donating sperm or eggs can be lucrative, but many may shy away from the thought, because not knowing if there's a little one running around with your DNA seems overwhelming.\nIn every case except for breast milk, some form of screening is usually involved.\nFor some, the idea of substitute teaching sounds awful. But consider the stay-at-home mom or dad that likes being with kids, and is good in front of them. For these folks, substitute teaching offers a great way to connect with the community, get out of the house, and get paid. It's also not a bad choice for those who have just gotten their teaching degree, but not yet landed a job.\nThe amount you can be paid for substitute teaching varies widely, with certified teachers, or long-term substitutes, often earning more. No matter your background, though, there's a shortage of substitute teachers. If you impress the administration, you could have a job as often as you like.\nState with lowest-paid substitute teacher rate: South Carolina, $35 per day.\nState with highest-paid substitute teacher rate: Minnesota, $141 per day.\nHere's another job that's very hit or miss when it comes to pay. If you work Friday and Saturday evenings at a bar that's popular, you could easily end up making over $1,000 per weekend. But competition for those slots is high, and it often requires a lot of energy, too.\nDo not attempt without proper training!

Everything got blamed. As a country, we seemed to be a mess.\nAnd then we suddenly weren\u2019t. When six of the seven teams qualified for the playoffs the following season, with Ottawa coming within an overtime goal of the Stanley Cup final, it appeared as though we might have overreacted. But 12 months later, the teams were back at square one.\nWith three quarters of the season complete, only Winnipeg and Toronto are currently locked into playoff spots. Calgary, which is a point out of a wild card spot, could make it three. But overall the standings aren\u2019t pretty: four of the six worst teams in the NHL (Ottawa, Vancouver, Montreal and Edmonton) are once again based in Canada.\nOnce again, it\u2019s easy to see why.\nMismanagement \u2014 not a failure to attract free agents \u2014 is the reason why Ottawa, Vancouver, Montreal and Edmonton have become punch lines. In a season when Vegas can enter the league and build a roster from scratch, it\u2019s inexcusable that a team with the best defenceman (Ottawa), the best goalie (Montreal) and the best player (Edmonton) cannot even sneak into the playoffs.\nThe question is whether any of them will be able to turn things around for next season \u2014 or whether that\u2019s even the right move.\nRebuilds are needed in Ottawa and Montreal, who appear to be heading that way after dangling Erik Karlsson and Max Pacioretty, respectively, at the trade deadline. Edmonton needs to shuffle its Rubik\u2019s cube of a roster that still doesn\u2019t look right. And Vancouver has to stop re-tooling and go all-in with their kids, even if it means not bringing back the Sedin twins and buying out a bad contract.\nIn other words, more pain could be coming.\n\u2022 Will this be the year Canada ends its championship drought?

The team is 3-4-1 since Smith got hurt on Feb. 6.\n\u2022 St. Louis players were obviously unhappy that management traded Paul Stastny at the deadline and on Tuesday they showed it in an 8-3 loss to the Wild that looked more like a protest.

The researchers avoided giving a single figure for the cost of cyber crime, because the total depends on what is counted.\nInstead, they suggested that fraud in welfare and tax systems \u2013 increasingly performed in the cyber world \u2013 costed each citizen a few hundred pounds a year on average.\nFraud associated with payment cards and online banking costs just a few tens of pounds a year. But the fear of fraud by businesses and consumers is leading some to avoid online transactions, imposing an indirect cost on the economy that is several times higher.\nBy contrast, true cyber crime \u2013 scams that completely depend on the internet \u2013 are only costing citizens an average of a few tens of pence a year directly, while the indirect costs \u2013 such as the money spent on anti-virus software \u2013 can be a hundred times that.\nThe report found that, each year, the UK spends $1bn on efforts to protect against or clean up after a threat, including $170 million on anti-virus. By contrast, just $15m is spent on law enforcement.\nThe study concludes that cyber criminals \u2013 often only a small number of gangs \u2013 are pulling in a few tens of pounds from every citizen a year. But the indirect costs to those citizens \u2013 either in protective measures such as anti-virus or in cleaning up infected PCs \u2013 is at least ten times as much.\nThe Cambridge scientists, working with colleagues in Germany, the Netherlands, the USA and elsewhere in the UK, considered all the main types of cyber crime. They collected figures for direct and indirect costs for each, including the cost of defending against it.\n\u201cSome police forces believe the problem is too large to tackle,\" said Anderson.\n\"In fact, a small number of gangs lie behind many incidents and locking them up would be far more effective than telling the public to fit an anti-phishing toolbar or purchase anti-virus software.\n\"Cyber crooks impose disproportionate costs on society and we have to become more efficient at fighting cyber crime.\"\nThe report is to be presented on 25 June, at the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security in Berlin, Germany.\nAgreed: The lack of effort to prosecute Internet criminals is extraordinary.\nThe media seems to celebrate the supposed \"skills and daring\" of the scum behind Internet & phone scams; and to portray"}

In exchange for Verlander, arguably the franchise\u2019s best pitcher all-time, the Tigers received three highly regarded prospects: right-handed starter Franklin Perez, outfielder Daz Cameron and catcher Jake Rogers.\nThe move \u2013 which came hours after the team shipped All-Star outfielder Justin Upton to the Angels \u2013 is the surest sign the Tigers have entered a rebuilding phase, one that will be painful, could be lengthy and closes the chapter on perhaps the most successful stretch of baseball in franchise history.\nFor Verlander, he gets the opportunity to pitch for a contending team for this season and the next two. For the Tigers, they continue to replenish their farm system and get financial relief.\nVerlander was owed $28 million in each of the next two seasons. Tigers are paying the Astros $16 million in the trade, according to USA Today\u2019s Bob Nightengale.\nAbout the finances, Avila said he is under no mandate by ownership to cut payroll.\nAnd what the Tigers want is to get younger. For their payroll to get leaner. For their talent to be homegrown and their future success sustainable at a time when their free-spending model, initiated a decade ago by late owner Mike Ilitch, is no longer feasible.\nHe didn\u2019t dare put a timeframe on that turnaround: There are too many variables and too much uncertainty to predict how long it will take the Tigers \u2013 whose high-priced, aging roster is still not fully deconstructed \u2013 to climb out of the abyss that is almost certain to follow in the years to come.\nThe next step was trading Verlander.

Its website states that it can help if you \"want to get pregnant, be prepared for your next period or understand your mood swings.\"\nThe app was launched in mid-2013 and earlier this year reported about 5 million monthly active users. It hasn't disclosed the latest figures, but Clue founder Ida Tin said the user base is \"growing very nicely.\"\nNokia Growth Partners, the VC arm of Nokia, led the round with existing investors Union Square Ventures, Mosaic Ventures, Brigitte Mohn and Christophe Maire also participating.\nClue could be of strategic importance to Nokia which has been trying to expand into new areas such as virtual reality and health care. Earlier this year, Nokia announced the acquisition of fitness wearable gadget maker Withings for 170 million euros ($181.35 million).\nWithings Chief Executive Cedric Hutchings became head of Nokia's digital health business with the company citing its strength in \"preventive health and patient care\". This is where German start-up Clue could feed in.\nTin said that initial discussions regarding how Clue could work with Withings has been discussed but nothing has been decided.\n\"A company like Withings is interesting. We need to meet the parents first so we haven't started connecting to other portfolio companies. We have talked about it (working together), I'm sure it will happen but nothing concrete yet,\" Tin told CNBC in a phone interview.\nClue faces competition from other similar apps such a Glow in the U.S. which also tracks women's menstrual cycle providing data on ovulation and mood. Clue also is currently not making money. The company's chief executive said that it has been focusing on growing its user base and is now making plans to open up revenue streams.\n\"We have many ideas, we will start experimenting this year,\" Tin told CNBC, saying that she could not give specific details.\n\"We have chosen to be strictly consumer facing, at this point we want to focus on business models that are consumer facing. We are very much a trust-based service, people trust us with very personal information. By having a consumer facing business model, people can understand how we make money. If it's a business model that is invisible, they might assume we are selling data, which we aren't doing.\"\nThe U.S. is Clue's biggest market and the start-up is continuing to expand into new regions including Japan and India where it has launched local-language versions of its app. Tin said that Clue can reach a worldwide audience.\n\"There is a huge social movement around menstrual health and mobile growth is exploding, so all these things combined make these markets interesting. We are addressing a real need for people and that need is truly global,\" Tin told CNBC."}

That represents a 15.1 percent increase from 2016. The data show a flattening of the death rate nationally with some states even showing modest decreases in their death toll. However, there is little to cheer for those of us in the upper Midwest and Southern regions where the opioid overdose epidemic maintains its tragically strong grip.\nThese differential effects of the overdose crisis should not be a surprise. Overall the states hardest hit exhibit poverty, inadequate health care, and marginalized populations; the progenitors of death from suicide, chronic substance use, and overdoses, collectively what we call diseases of despair. Indiana is one of the unhealthier states, particularly with regard to health behaviors and health outcomes. The state\u2019s public health infrastructure is underfunded and we underperform most states in terms of infant and adult mortality rates, obesity, and tobacco control.\nIndiana is not one of the poorest states, yet 32 percent of Hoosiers are poor. The state ranks in the bottom third for education and sees high disparities in the employment gap by race and gender. These conditions \u2014 income, education, employment, among others \u2014 are recognized as social determinants of health. Poverty, housing insecurity, and lack of education are correlated with poor health outcomes, including substance use disorder. Long-term investments to address the social determinants of health are essential interventions to curbing the addictions crisis in Indiana. Until remedied, these problems will cause higher than average addiction and death rates not only during this crisis but in the crises that inevitably will follow.\nIn Washington, D.C. there is growing optimism that opioids legislation will be considered by the Senate the week after Labor Day. In June, the House passed a substantial package of direct federal interventions and dollars for various state programs that should better fund and expand options for treatment and care coordination. As the Senate takes up consideration of its own proposals our Congressional leadership must continue to press for additional funding for states like Indiana that have been hit particularly hard by the opioid overdose epidemic and also ensure that the horizon for state spending of these federal funds is sensible, giving us time to build up infrastructure and make long-term improvements in preventing and treating substance use disorders. Federal funding also is needed to improve housing and education to ensure these social determinants do not exacerbate the next addiction crisis.\nThere are also steps we can take immediately to reduce the death toll in Indiana. At our Statehouse, members of the General Assembly are beginning the process of formulating legislation that will be considered in the new year. At the state level the overwhelming priority must be harm reduction, making overdoses less likely and saving lives when they do. This summer\u2019s decision by Marion County to institute a robust syringe exchange program is of great importance. The program will include HIV and hepatitis C testing and offer referrals for those seeking substance use disorder and mental health treatment. Hopefully the example of Marion County and others around the state will persuade more communities throughout Indiana to embrace an evidence-based program proven to improve health outcomes without increasing addiction.\nHowever, for such public health harm reduction strategies to work the General Assembly needs to make some changes to Indiana law. If persons in harm fear arrest for themselves or their loved ones, they are less likely to seek help. As a result, we need legislation that better"}

NSC works together with the Norwegian fisheries and aquaculture industry to develop markets for Norwegian seafood exporters. The trademark \u201cSeafood from Norway\u201d is a symbol of origin and quality for Norwegian seafood, farmed or wild, caught or raised in Norway\u2019s cold and clear waters.\nThis year, Steenslid said NSC will continue to promote Norwegian seafood to quality- conscious Thai consumers through various activities.\nIts plans include product promotions at leading supermarket and restaurant chains and engagements with key media and influencers.\nIn term of business-to-business (B2B), it will help increase quality awareness and the proper handling of Norwegian seafood products through information, education and training to supermarket employees and chefs.\nFor the business-to-consumer (B2C) market, it aims to inspire more cooking of Norwegian seafood at home and informing consumers about its origin.\n\u201cJust as Thai consumers associate sushi with Japan, we want them to associate Norway with salmon,\u201d he said.\nHe added that in the past three years, export of fresh Norwegian salmon to Thailand increased by 25 per cent a year, and for the first time it has exceeded 10,000 tonnes in 2018.\nLast year, total export of Norwegian seafood to Thailand was 29,000 tonnes, an increase of 10 per cent from the previous year, at a value of around Bt 4.8 billion.\nOf the imports in 2018, salmon accounted for 50 per cent, while 40 per cent were mackerel.\n\u201cThe consumption of Norwegian salmon and other seafood are expected to grow continuously in Thailand as consumers become more quality conscious.

Newark International Airport has had the highest fares of all, due to United Continental's dominance there.\nHowever, earlier this year, the FAA made a momentous decision to remove slot restrictions at Newark Airport. Last week, this culminated in an important announcement: ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) plans to start flying to Newark Airport this fall.\nAllegiant Air will add Newark Airport to its route network in November. Image source: Wikimedia Commons.\nIn the coming years, Allegiant's fellow ultra-low-cost carriers -- Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier Airlines -- may also choose to start serving Newark Airport. The growth of budget carriers at Newark Airport could ultimately help liberate New Yorkers from high airfares.\nNew York City has the highest fares for domestic travelers of any major metro area in the country. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the average domestic fare for travelers flying from New York City was $406, 10% higher than the average for the eight largest U.S. metropolitan areas.\nAmong the three major New York-area airports, Newark International Airport is the priciest. In Q4 2015, the average domestic fare there was nearly 10% higher than at the second most-expensive major airport (San Francisco) and 26% higher than the average for the 15 busiest U.S. airports.\nThere are three main reasons why Newark Airport is so expensive. First, United has held a whopping 73% of the slots there, stifling competition. Second, Newark has by far the highest airport usage fees in the country. Third -- and somewhat related to the first two points -- none of the three U.S. ULCCs fly to Newark Airport today.\nRecent experience has shown that the presence of ULCCs can keep fares down at major airports, even if their market share remains fairly low.\nFor example, Spirit Airlines began serving Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in May 2011, providing the first ULCC competition there. Between Q1 2011 (the last quarter before Spirit arrived) and Q1 2014, the average airfare there fell 6.1%, adjusting for inflation. During the same period, the average inflation-adjusted airfare rose 1.6% nationwide.\nSpirit Airlines' arrival in Dallas helped drive down airfares there.

Between Q4 2013 (just before Allegiant started service in Cincinnati) and Q4 2015, the average domestic airfare in Cincinnati plunged more than 20% adjusted for inflation, whereas the nationwide average fare fell by a more modest 6.5%.\nAllegiant arrives at Newark, but will others follow?\nULCCs have grown rapidly in the past five years or so.

Now P.R. gurus court influential voices on the social Web to endorse new companies, Web sites or gadgets \u2014 a transformation that analysts and practitioners say is likely to permanently change the role of P.R. in the business world, and particularly in Silicon Valley.\nWhile public relations is just one arrow in the marketing quiver for most companies, it plays an especially crucial role in a region where dozens of start-ups are born each month. Without money for advertising, these unknown companies have to promote themselves to potential users, investors, employees and partners.\nIn the new world of social media, P.R. people must know hundreds of writers, bloggers and Twitter users instead of having six top reporters on speed dial. Ms. Hammerling, the latest example of the omnipresent start-up pitchwoman, is the doyenne of who-you-know P.R.\nShe arrived in Silicon Valley from the East Coast in 1997, just when the dot-com craze was reaching a crescendo and P.R.\u2019s pivotal role in the start-up world was being cemented. And the evolution of her own tactics has run parallel to the ever-changing marketing forays that make this area a singular hotbed of promotional experimentation.\nDena Cook, Ms. Hammerling\u2019s business partner at Brew Media Relations, recalls the boom years when start-ups sent P.R. firms handsome checks that the firms had to return because they didn\u2019t have room for new clients.

Just a few months ago, investors thought the economy would expand rapidly this year. Now they\u2019re not so sure and shifting their money around in surprising ways in a sign that a fragile confidence still haunts the recovery five years after it officially began.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Wall Street has caught a case of the jitters.\nEmployers are hiring at their fastest pace in 2 \u00bd years, the economy is expected to expand by a robust 3.5 percent this quarter and corporate earnings have hit a record. But you wouldn't know it from the way many investors are acting.\nThey're pouring money into U.S. Treasury bonds, considered the world's safest asset. They're loading up on dull, but reliable utility stocks. They're dumping holdings that would get hurt most from a stalled recovery, like stocks of retailers and risky small companies.\nJust a few months ago, investors thought the economy would grow rapidly this year. Now they're not so sure and shifting money around in surprising ways, a sign that confidence remains fragile five years into a recovery.\n\"It doesn't take much \u2014 an itsy-bitsy sell-off \u2014 and suddenly everyone is conservative,\" says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \"We've climbed a wall of worry throughout this recovery and we're still doing that.\"\nMany experts had expected a recovery that finally felt like one this year. More companies would be hiring, consumers would spend more, and businesses that had slashed expenses to generate profits would now earn them by selling more. Investors would unload safe government bonds, forcing their prices down and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, up.\nBut the year is unfolding somewhat off script.\nOn Friday, an index of small-company stocks that are often good bets in an accelerating economy was teetering on a \"correction,\" Wall Street parlance for a drop of 10 percent from a high. And instead of selling government bonds, investors have bought so much, it has pushed down the yield on U.S. Treasury notes maturing in 10 years to 2.51 percent, half a percentage point lower in just five months. That is a big move for bonds.\nThere's plenty of reason for caution \u2014 a stalled housing recovery, for instance, disappointing first-quarter economic growth in the U.S. and Europe, a possible civil war in Ukraine and a cooling Chinese economy. The flood of money into U.S. government bonds may reflect frustration as much as fear. Investors seeking income may be turning to the U.S. because they're unhappy with the paltry payouts on bonds of other rich countries, such as those of Japan and Germany, where yields are even lower.\nBut something not as easy to pinpoint, more ephemeral, may also be prompting investors to play it safer: Many Americans, still haunted by the financial crisis, don't trust the recovery.\n\"They're not willing to take risks,\" says Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist of Advisors Asset Management. He points to bankers still too scared to lend, CEOs playing it safe by using cash to buy back stocks instead of expanding operations, and consumers not \"buying that fifth TV.\"\nJeff Klingelhofer, an associate bond portfolio manager"}

The visiting Cougars took advantage of numerous turnovers and a porous defense as they raced to an early 8-0 lead before Emerie Rios found the Tigers' first bucket.\nSenior Elisabeth Perl scored nine of her 15 points in the first quarter against Sterling via short jumpers and easy lay-ups. With the score 17-4 at the end of the first quarter, it looked like the rout was on.\nThe Tiger defense bounced back in the second quarter, holding the Cougars to two field goals and a free throw. Unfortunately they failed to get into an offensive rhythm and had to settle for a long three by Hailey Fehringer for their only points in the quarter. Despite just five points scored in the second quarter, the Cougars held a comfortable 22-7 lead heading into the break.\nDown by 15 points and with their backs against the wall, the Tigers mounted a comeback in the second half with junior Jasmine Cardona, who came in off the bench scoring five of her eight points in the third quarter.\n\"She did make a very big difference in our second half. She helped relieve some pressure on Aubree (Long) bringing the ball up the court; she hit some outside jumpers and she attacked the basket well. I mean, she definitely came in and gave us a spark off the bench,\" said coach Kristen Hamil, who also credited her defense for stepping up.\nAllie Schumacher got hot from beyond the arc with two big 3-pointers and a free throw in the third quarter. Valerie Allen and Jaden Newson chipped in two apiece for the Tigers' best offensive quarter of the game.\nSterling showed true grit in the second half, outscoring their opponent 27-25 and holding Perl to a field goal in the fourth quarter. However the Cougars found senior Molli Peacock for 13 of her 15 points in the second half to squash any possible Tiger comeback.\nHeading into the season, Hamil knew she would face ups and downs with a young team of mostly sophomores and freshmen.\n\"Our biggest problem is just consistency,\" the coach said. \"If we could put four quarters together like we played our last two, the third and fourth quarters, we're going to do some damage in the league, but right now we're having a hard time putting 32 minutes together.\"\nDespite dropping to 2-7 overall and 1-2 in conference play, Hamil was proud to see the effort her team put in after going down by double digits at half-time.\n\"I can't be more proud of their effort tonight because a lot of teams would have had that first half and just laid down...it would have been a 40-point blowout game, but they put it together, they fought back and they showed their pride. So, I have to be proud of their effort.\"\nThe road ahead will be a difficult one for the Lady Tigers as face a tough opponent on the road Friday night.

Lisa is back in his hometown of Voronezh, while the boy is undergoing medical treatment in Moscow.\nRoma was diagnosed with leukemia four years ago. Intensive chemotherapy followed, but then there he had a relapse which affected his nervous system. Roma then headed to Moscow for a bone marrow transplant. The surgery was successful.\nIn Russia there are quotas for the number of patients who can receive free, state of the art hospital care. The number varies from region to region and from year to year. The quotas can be changed, but if you live far from the capital, your chances are slim.\nThe national oncology center in the south of Moscow is the biggest in Russia, though it can only hold 150 cancer patients at a time. Even if parents are lucky to get a place for their child there, another problem arises. For Roma the distance to this hospital from Voronezh is approximately 500 kilometers. However, residents of Chita seeking medical care have to travel 6500 km, while people from Vladivostok have to travel a staggering 9000 kilometers. It is these distances which often work against people like Roma receiving successful treatment.\n\u201cThe boy needed his cancer-affected bone to be replaced with prostheses. Doctors started preparing us for the surgery, but this preparation dragged on for months,\u201d Aleksandr explained.\nThe boy waited for his operation patiently, but the tumor didn\u2019t. Three months before the boy's death, blood tests revealed that in addition to the deadly cancer, he also had HIV. His parents were not surprised, since the boy had had so many blood tests and transfusions in different hospitals.\nThe country\u2019s biggest charity for children with cancer says the medical system itself needs to be cured.\n\u201cThe idea of quotas isn\u2019t bad, but it lacks efficiency,\u201d Ekaterina Chistyakova, a spokeswoman for the charity said.\n\u201cCurrently in Russia only 10% to 20% of cancer patients can receive operations. For others there are simply not enough places in hospitals. Also, parents lack information. They often desperately look for financial help and they don\u2019t know that they can receive it for free from the state,\u201d she added.\nRoma is one of the lucky few, whose treatment was completely funded by the state.

We lead industrialized nations in infant and maternal mortality, lag in life expectancy, and rank 81st in the world in mortality that could be prevented by good medical care.

Our per capita costs are about $10,000/year, whereas most industrialized nations are between $4,000 and $8,000.\nAbout 17 percent of our economy goes to health care, compared with 8 percent to 11 percent in other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.\nAdministrative costs are much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere. We spend anywhere from 2 to 5 times more per capita on administrative costs than any other country. Private insurers spend from 10 percent to 30 percent of revenues on non- health care expenses. These include marketing, lobbying, profits, executive salaries, and denying care. In 2016, health insurers made over $13 billion in profits, with CEOs pulling down eight-figure salaries.\nWhile the average administrative cost of private insurers is about 20 percent of revenues, traditional Medicare is about 3 percent.\nMany medications cost 50 percent to 100 percent more here than elsewhere, and we spend twice the OECD average per capita.

Comprehensive coverage is provided for medical, dental, pharmaceutical, eye and long-term care.\nThere is no cost sharing, such as deductibles, co-pays or co-insurance. How can we afford this? By eliminating private health insurance for these services and cutting out hundreds of billions in administrative costs that add no value to our system. By having a single national network that can effectively negotiate prices with pharmaceutical and medical device makers. Single-payer will result in a leaner, better performing system with improved care and lower costs. Lives will be saved, and suffering reduced.

I said, 'I don't want to take a trip with you.' I was panicked. I just kept saying over and over again, 'Please not this.' I didn't want to go.\"\nRighter, 22, of Columbia has pleaded not guilty to eight counts, including kidnapping, false imprisonment and assault.\nHe fixed his eyes on the floor throughout Musick's testimony. Musick -- who seemed unnerved by Righter's courtroom behavior -- glanced at him several times.\nMusick was the last of several witnesses to testify for the prosecution, which wound up its case in Howard County Circuit Court. If convicted of kidnapping, Righter could be sentenced to 30 years in prison.\nToday, the defense is expected to present its case.\nMusick said Righter approached her outside her home in the exclusive River Hill section of Columbia as she walked to her car to go to work.\nIt was about 7: 50 a.m. He was carrying a gun, she said.\nThey knew each other from work, but that was as far as she wanted it to go.\nRighter's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Louis P. Willemin, painted him as a lovesick man, describing him in brief opening statements yesterday as \"infatuated\" with her. But he said Righter never meant to cause her -- or anyone else -- any physical harm.\n\"He was just very, very interested in her,\" Willemin said, asking Judge Dennis M. Sweeney, who is hearing the case without a jury, to keep an open mind.\nThat interest, Musick testified, scared her.\nRighter followed her at work, she said, even after she told him he had to stop. For her birthday, he left her a note and cookie on her car outside Sears at The Mall in Columbia. The note thanked her for talking to him when no one else did and was signed \"John Righter. The tragic hero,\" she testified.\nHe sent her a poem by e-mail and once followed her home from Western Maryland College, where she is majoring in social work, she said.\nOn Sept. 5, she called police and told them she was being harassed.\nPolice have said that they talked to Righter, who lives in the 5000 block of Green Mountain Circle in Columbia, and that he promised he would stay away from her.\nBut two weeks later, Musick's neighbors testified, they witnessed an abduction they could not believe was unfolding in this placid suburb.\n\"It was like in slow-motion,\" testified Alan Fennell, who said he saw Musick and Righter argue, and watched as Righter slapped handcuffs on her and pushed her into a vehicle. \"I couldn't believe it was a real crime.\"\nEarlier, as neighbors watched, Musick"}
{"idx": "17937", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Which fake movie companies would make the best employers?\nMovie characters are a lot like real people in many respects. They have hopes and dreams, and they have problems of their own, only their problems tend to be much more dramatic and interesting. Most movie characters are also tasked with making a living so that they can support themselves in their little fictional worlds. Fake groceries aren\u2019t free, and that fake mortgage doesn\u2019t pay itself. So characters have to venture out into the phony \u201creal world\u201d and find imaginary jobs at wholly invented companies. There have been many memorable, fictional businesses in films over the years. But which of these ersatz companies would make the best and worst employers, if they were real?\nEuroffice, a U.K. office supply website, has looked into it. Drawing on its vast knowledge of real working environments, the company has evaluated five famous movie companies, ranging from Initech from Office Space to Stark Industries from Iron Man, in three separate categories: job security, work environment, and pay. Their findings, presented in infographic form, should prove useful to people who somehow find themselves transported to a fictional movie universe and need to find stable employment.\nNot surprisingly, Initech ranks the lowest of them all, scoring a miserable one-star rating in all three categories. So dreary is the environment there that Initech even rates lower than the Weyland-Yutani Corp from the Alien franchise, a business that routinely puts its employees in mortal danger. On the other hand, Weyland-Yutani pays pretty well, and the job does offer opportunities for travel. The Channel 4 news team from Anchorman, meanwhile, rates highly in all three categories, but there\u2019s a major caveat: \u201cAll marks should be halved if you are female.\u201d The title company from Monsters, Inc. would make a decent employer, too, but Euroffice includes \u201cworking with children\u201d as both a perk and a con of the job."}

That\u2019s called blowing off steam.\nWant to send a message? Possess the puck more. Generate some shots. Complete more than two passes in a row before turning it over. Finish a check with the same thunderclap as Big Buff and his cohorts keep delivering.\nPut forth the most complete effort of the season to show that this won\u2019t just be a leisurely stroll through the park for the Jets.\nThat would get people\u2019s attention.\nFinding some way to generate offense is at the top of their to-do list. Mustering one shot in the first 15 minutes of the third period isn\u2019t going to cut it.\nWinnipeg\u2019s physical style is having an effect on the Wild\u2019s ability to control the puck and establish time in the offensive zone. Just about every time a Wild player retrieves the puck along the boards, ka-boom, he gets flattened against the glass like a bug on a windshield.\nJets bruiser Dustin Byfuglien is like a great white shark lurking. He has delivered a few jarring hits already, including one on captain Mikko Koivu in Game 2 that made Wild players look even more tentative. They can feel Big Buff\u2019s presence.\nThe Jets are outhitting and outshooting the Wild by a wide margin. The Wild held an edge in faceoffs won in Game 2 and still managed to do next to nothing offensively. The Jets are smothering them and not letting up.\nThat blueprint isn\u2019t going to change. It\u2019s up to the Wild to find a way out of the straitjacket.\n\u201cOur play through the neutral zone with the puck hasn\u2019t been good at all,\u201d Parise said.\nThe first two games would have been more tilted if not for goalie Devan Dubnyk, who is doing everything in his power to stop the floodgates from opening. He\u2019s getting little help.\nBeing back at Xcel Energy Center should provide a spark. The Wild is usually tough at home. And maybe tweaks to line combinations will create something positive.\nThe Jets have been superior so far because of their size, speed and physical play. Solving those issues isn\u2019t an easy fix.\n\u201cThere are things structurally that we have to do way better than just pure desperation,\u201d Parise said.\nUnfortunately, the Wild understands very well the desperation needed for Game 3 when trailing 0-2 in a series. This is the fourth consecutive playoff series and seventh in the past eight that the Wild has lost the first two games.\nParise called it a \u201cbad habit,\u201d but it\u2019s also an annoying habit. This narrative has become too familiar. Constantly having to dig out of a hole isn\u2019t conducive for playoff success. The Wild\u2019s margin for error is so small again.\nParise doesn\u2019t believe the nonsense that took place in the final seconds on Friday will have any bearing on Game 3. Nor should it. Animosity typically builds over the course of a series. The Wild has more pressing concerns."}

Payne has been nominated numerous times for directing and writing awards from the folks at both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, and he\u2019s nabbed the scripting gold for \"The Descendants,\" \"Sideways\" and \"About Schmidt.\"\nHis name will likely be on those short lists again, but this time so will that of Bruce Dern, who, playing Woody, has gotten and delivered one of the best roles of his career. Woody\u2019s taking that walk to Nebraska to claim the million dollar prize he won in one of those magazine sweepstakes contests. He lost his driver\u2019s license due to excessive drinking, and no one \u2013 not his wife, neither of his two sons \u2013 is going to give him a ride. And since he won\u2019t listen to anyone that\u2019s trying to tell him the prize is bogus, he hits the highway on foot, only to be stopped immediately by the cops.\nAs Payne has done in all of his previous films (most of them set in Nebraska), he introduces us to his characters, then allows us to get inside their heads. Actually, much of that was done here by first-time screenwriter Bob Nelson, and this is the first film Payne has directed that he hasn\u2019t also written. But it\u2019s Payne that lets his actors know what he wants from them to get the story told and the characters understood, then steps back and lets them do it.\nThe business of the million dollars keeps coming up, and keeps pushing the plot along, but it\u2019s the people that take the front seat here. Dern\u2019s Woody is a man of few words, and probably always has been. He\u2019s a retired auto mechanic, a nice guy who\u2019s always helped others and now, without much money, but seeing what he believes is a jackpot flashing in front of his eyes, he expects people to help him in return.\nBut his wife, Kate (June Squibb, who played Jack Nicholson\u2019s wife in \u201cAbout Schmidt\u201d), is at her wit\u2019s end with him, and his sons, Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and David (Will Forte) have no idea what to do about dear old dad. Well, it\u2019s really only David that would use that loving term on him. Kate is fed up with years of neglect (and let\u2019s not forget that drinking), and Ross is just too selfishly busy to have any concern about dad\u2019s crazy ideas. It\u2019s David who sees that there\u2019s a problem and would like to help, even if the only way he can think to go about it is to give his dad a ride to where he wants to go.\nSo we get a road-trip movie, a father-son relationship movie, a husband-wife relationship movie, a pie-in-the-sky dreamer movie ... the list could go on. It also includes an examination of what happens when old friends, if they ever really were friends, are led to believe that someone in their group has stumbled onto some good fortune. So we also get the story of Woody\u2019s long ago rocky business relationship with the blustery Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), and it\u2019s not very pretty.\nBut the movie sure is, physically. It\u2019s shot in stark and stunning black and white,"}

The benefits are proving out, notes this opinion piece by Christian Greiser and Jan-Philipp Martini of the Boston Consulting Group. Greiser is a senior partner, managing director and the global leader of the firm\u2019s operations practice who works with senior leaders around the globe. Martini is an associate who supports clients around the world on enterprise-wide agile transformations.\nVolatile markets, challenging consumer demands, and the technological disruptions resulting from digitization and Industry 4.0 are producing unprecedented rates of change. In response, companies have worked to increase organizational agility, hoping to foster innovation and shorten go-to-market cycles. Yet organizational experiences and sociological conditioning often impede true agility. As a result, many of these efforts fall short of their objective to manage the uncertainty generated by change. But another movement \u2014 mindfulness \u2014 will help companies overcome these challenges.\nMindfulness is a centuries-old idea that has been reinvented to address the challenges of our digital age. In essence, mindfulness describes a state of being present in the moment and leaving behind one\u2019s tendency to judge. It allows one to pause amid the constant inflow of stimuli and consciously decide how to act, rather than react reflexively with ingrained behavior patterns. Mindfulness, therefore, is perfectly suited to counterbalance the digital-age challenges of information overload and constant distraction.\nThe benefits of mindfulness are both clear and proven. Mindfulness programs help leaders and employees reflect effectively, focus sharply on the task at hand, master peak levels of stress, and recharge quickly. On an organizational level, mindfulness reduces sick days, increases trust in leadership, and boosts employee engagement. What\u2019s more, mindfulness helps to unlock the full potential of digital and agile transformations. New processes and structures are just the starting points for these transformations.\nNot surprisingly, interest in mindfulness is growing, especially among digital natives: In the past decade, the rate of increase in Google searches for mindfulness has outpaced that of all Google searches by a factor of four. Furthermore, years of scientific research and modern forms of teaching have fueled its popularity. Now, mindfulness apps even come pre-installed on smartphones and tablets.\nYet integrating mindfulness in the corporate context can be challenging. Some companies encounter vocal skeptics; others struggle with entrenched ways of working. Even leaders and employees who are eager to try out mindfulness find it hard to get started. To unleash the power of mindfulness, companies will have to embrace a holistic approach to corporate agility.\nTo support their agility efforts, many companies have applied \u201ccosmetic\u201d digital-age solutions, such as hackathons, agile meetings (for example, short daily standup meetings to discuss progress and obstacles), and new visualization techniques and creativity tools.\nResistance to Change. As the pace of change increases, employees will have to continuously adapt to evolving circumstances. In most organizations, however, the existing ways of working leave employees unprepared to do so. They may therefore respond with reflexive resistance, a defense mechanism to avoid the discomfort of psychological uncertainty. Organizational politics and poor communication about the purpose of making changes only strengthen this resistance.\nOvervaluing Expertise. Many employees think and interact at work by applying expertise that they gained before the digital age, when efficiency, not agility, was the overarching objective. Such an approach encourages closed-mindedness.\nMindfulness enables people to radically strengthen their ability to adapt quickly to evolving circumstances and ambiguous situations and to increase the speed with which they learn new things.

Some people may be just getting started in their careers, making small starting salaries. Others may be stay-at-home parents with no earned income. Everyone is juggling a plethora of different financial goals, of which retirement is just one. And those who are midway through their careers and who have procrastinated signing up for their workplace retirement plans may be wondering if there&apos;s any point at all to begin saving now.\nThe fact is, the best time to save for retirement is right now, no matter what your personality traits are or where you are in the continuum of your career. Bankrate consults financial experts who offer some tips on how to make it happen. Their advice will help you get motivated, so one day you can make a seamless transition from the 9-to-5 workday world to a retirement where you can call the shots on how to spend your time and money.\nDon&apos;t ever think you&apos;re too young to save for retirement. As a new worker, \"entry-level Emily\" has something far more valuable than her experienced superiors: time. A 25-year-old worker who saves $5,000 a year throughout her career will amass nearly $1.3 million by the time she&apos;s 65, assuming 8% annual growth. If she waits until age 35 to save, she&apos;ll accumulate less than half that amount -- $566,416 -- assuming the same return.\nBottom line: If you&apos;re just starting your career, don&apos;t walk -- run -- to open a retirement account.\nGrab free money. Have access to a 401(k)? Save enough to qualify for your employer&apos;s matching funds. That&apos;s typically 50 cents for every dollar you save, up to 6% of earnings.\nAutomate your savings. If you don&apos;t have a 401(k) plan at work, set up direct deposits into an individual retirement account at a brokerage firm before you spend your whole paycheck.\nGo for growth. \"An entry-level worker should put 100% of their retirement fund in equities,\" says CFP professional Drew Tignanelli, president of Financial Consulate in Hunt Valley, Md. The reason: Stocks grow more over time, and you&apos;re young enough to ride out dips in the market.\nRough it. Saving early is potentially worth millions, so make sacrifices now. \"Keep eating ramen noodles, and save like crazy until you&apos;re 30,\" says Rick Kahler, president of Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D. \"Then you can look at upping your lifestyle.\"\nEven if \"stay-at-home Sally\" has no earnings, she can still save for retirement.

{"idx": "17980", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: One dank January day in 1976, I stood on an English hillside with my mother and watched men with chain saws cutting up wrecks of trees and tossing brushwood onto fires. I was 5 years old, amazed by the roaring blades and drifting smoke, and troubled too.\n\u2018\u2018Why are they burning them?\u2019\u2019 I asked her.\nHer words were a shock. I\u2019d assumed until then that the countryside was an eternal and unchanging place. At that time, Dutch elm disease was spreading across continents, a blight had killed four billion American chestnuts, and catastrophic new tree diseases were to follow. Last week that cold hillside of my childhood came to mind as I drove through rural Suffolk, past painted farmhouses and arable fields sloping under soft gray cloud. The ash trees on this stretch of road were obviously dying. Their once-luxuriant crowns had thinned to an eerie transparency; instead of a shifting canopy of pinnate leaves, bare twigs showed stark against the sky.\nIt was my first sight of ash dieback disease, a new and virulent fungal infection that has spread westward across Europe and will likely kill nearly all the ashes in Britain. In America, the effects of the invasive emerald ash borer beetle have been just as devastating. Globalization is the culprit. While there have always been outbreaks of tree disease, about as many have appeared since the 1970s as in all recorded history. The accelerating scale and speed of international trade has brought numerous pathogens and pests to species with no natural resistance to them: If you are a tree, death comes hidden in wood veneer, in packing material, in shipping containers, nursery plants, cut flowers and imported saplings.\nLater that night, I compulsively searched for images of elms on the Internet, seeking their buoyant, ragged silhouettes in snapshots of village fields or half-hidden behind actors in 1960s films. I saw trees like frozen cumulonimbus clouds towering over cricket matches at English public schools; postcards and photographs of elm avenues in Massachusetts and coastal Maine, lofty branches shading summer streets and suburban Oldsmobiles. These trees were the ghosts of half-remembered landscapes, and looking at them I realized that living trees could haunt you, too. That drive in Suffolk had changed the meaning of ash trees for me. From now on, each one I saw would mean death, no matter how healthy it might be.\nShould they contract a mortal disease, however, trees cope far better than we do. Many can regenerate. The vast Appalachian chestnut forests crowned with white flowers have all but disappeared, but fallen trees still sprout new shoots from their roots. As soon as they reach a certain height they again become susceptible to blight and die. Chestnuts and elms living in this endlessly youthful state are less fruitful than mature trees, and they trouble us because they are not what we think they should be. We use trees to measure our own lives, to anchor our notions of time. To most of us, trees represent constancy and continuity, living giants that persist through many human generations. We want them to achieve maturity; we want them to tower above us.\nBut there are trees that can offer solace. I also looked for photographs of them on the Internet: the last few big American chestnuts, some of which have been given names. The Adair County Chestnut, found in 1999 in Kentucky, for"}

When considering which company to hire for tree care, you should always choose a service led by a certified arborist. Such a service\u2014like Advanced Tree Care\u2014will always deliver superior comprehensive service.\nWhy so much experience, across so many different aspects of the job? ISA certification means that an arborist is prepared to provide the benefit of his or her maximum expertise to the care of trees across a range of situations: from commercial or municipal properties to residential situations, through all four seasons (in our area), and in routine and emergency situations. That level of professional certification requires contending with every aspect of the job for full preparation.\nAfter successfully passing the examination, the arborist agrees to a set of ethics that will govern his or her professional behavior. The arborist then receives a certificate with the ISA seal, which designates him or her as an official ISA Certified Arborist.\nCertification is valid for three years, and continuing education is also required to maintain certification. Before the three years are up, the arborist must recertify, through retaking the exam or by accruing at least 30 continuing education credits.\nNow that you know what becoming an arborist requires, you'll understand why the professionals at Advanced Tree Care can deliver an outstanding level of service for the care of your trees."}

It adds not only living space to your property, but also aesthetic value. A sunburst deck design, in which the railings are built to represent a sunburst, improves the look of your deck and adds details that set it apart from other decks. There are a number of ways to include a sunburst in your deck design.\nA traditional deck railing has straight, vertically spaced rail balusters. In a sunburst design, the railing spindles angle out from a central point along the bottom rail to create an image of a sunburst. The opposite ends of the spindles attach at the sides to the adjoining vertical spindles, posts or other framing. The central spindles angle up and attach to the base of the top rail.\nWooden deck rails are typically treated lumber or a weather-resistant wood such as cedar or redwood. The rails are either prefabricated or custom cut from lumber stock. Each piece is cut to fit, with bevels at each end. To create an even more ornate sunburst, use turned spindles. The added detail will transform the sunburst into a design similar to the Victorian \"wagon wheel,\" often featured in railings and on house eaves. Give the sunburst even more flair with a coat of exterior stain, in a color that contrasts the surrounding rail.\nComposite decking, made from a combination of wood fiber and recycled plastic, come in prefabricated pieces, similar to those used for wooden rails. To create a sunburst with composites, try incorporating multiple colors of the material into the railing. Use one solid color for the rail and a separate color for the sunburst design, or use multiple colors for the sunburst.\nVinyl deck railings come strictly prefabricated in rail sections. They are available in several basic colors, depending on the manufacturer. Vinyl sunburst sections, sold already assembled, are ready to install into your rail system. This is by far the simplest option; but since no assembly is required, it can cost up to twice as much as the other options. Typically, a vinyl sunburst only installs into the same brand of railing, since each brand has its own fastening method.\nMorris, Mark. \"Sunburst Deck Ideas.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/sunburst-deck-ideas-98999.html.

It\u2019s 18 miles south of Fort Collins and 49 miles north of Denver.\nWhat is the course design?\nIt\u2019s a Scottish links-style course, with water coming into play on several holes and dozens of stacked, side-wall pot bunkers that sometimes block a direct shot toward the green. There are few trees.\nEach hole has five tee boxes, allowing the course to play from 4,000 yards to nearly 8,000 yards. Fairways are generously wide, membership director Mick Newberg said, allowing even those relatively new to the game to have an enjoyable round.\nThe par-3s are unusually picturesque, said Stephen Arendt, the course\u2019s head golf professional. The second hole has an island-like green on a peninsula surrounded by McNeil Reservoir. No. 8, juts out on a narrow peninsula into Lonetree Reservoir.\nMany of the par-4s are \u201crisk-reward\u201d holes, Arendt said, allowing golfers the opportunity to cut corners and reach the green from the tee box, but penalizing them severely \u2014 usually with those stacked pot bunkers \u2014 if they miss.\nOne of the par-5 holes, No. 13, stretches 780 yards off the back tees, making it one of the longest golf holes in the country, Arendt said.\nThe 18-hole layout, with more than 110 acres of irrigated tee boxes, fairways, rough and greens, is built on a loop that takes golfers more than 2\u00bd miles from the clubhouse at its furthest point, hole No. 8. It\u2019s a single loop rather than the two nine-hole loops to and from the clubhouse found on most golf courses.\nMembers and their guests began play Friday, but it won\u2019t open to the public until August, when the clubhouse is completed.\nPurchase a membership or befriend one of the 165 people who already have one and go as his or her guest. Or wait until August, when limited tee times to the public will become available.\nDaily greens fees for limited public tee times will start at $175. Memberships start at $25,000, with monthly dues of $325 this summer that will increase to more than $500 when the clubhouse, which also features a fitness center and private swimming pool, opens. Discounts are available for those under the age of 40 or owners of houses and townhouses in the 800-acre Heron Lakes development that borders the course.\nMembership information is available online at tpc.com/colorado or by calling the club at 970-663-5063.\nArthur Schaupeter, a 1990 University of Colorado graduate who has more than 20 years of experience building new golf courses and remodeling existing courses.

We don\u2019t want to support those who would gladly finish off those militants at any cost without any talks. We are ready to solve these problems in a way that would spare us additional casualties and destruction,\u201d Lavrov explained.\nOn Thursday, the Syrian Army put its active combat operations in eastern Aleppo on hold to evacuate some 8,000 civilians, Lavrov said earlier.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that the combat actions ended. I said they were suspended for a certain period so that civilians could leave the area\u2026 After the humanitarian pause, the military operation will continue until the militants leave eastern Aleppo,\u201d Lavrov noted on Friday, when asked about Thursday\u2019s statement.\nOn Friday, the Russian Reconciliation Center in Syria reported that, in the last 24 hours, 10,724 civilians have fled areas of eastern Aleppo controlled by the militants, including 4,015 children. Meanwhile, 30 militants surrendered and were granted amnesty.\nOn Thursday, US President Barack Obama granted a waiver of the restrictions on the delivery of military aid to \u201cforeign forces, irregular forces, groups, or individuals,\u201d if those forces are supporting the US\u2019 alleged counter-terrorism efforts in Syria.\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov believes that the prospect of terrorists coming into possession of those weapons, including MANPADs (man-portable anti-air missiles), \u201cposes a serious threat not only for the region, but the entire world.\u201d The US\u2019 decision will \u201cdefinitely\u201d create a risk for the Russian Air Force, Peskov said.\nThe decision will affect the discussions between the US and Russia on Syria, the Russian foreign minister stressed.\n\u201cThis will affect our talks, as this is yet another peculiarity of US foreign policy concerning Aleppo,\u201d Lavrov said.\nLavrov added that he is hopeful about the upcoming talks on Syria in Geneva, saying there\u2019s a good chance that an agreement can be reached regarding eastern Aleppo, provided that experts from the US actually show up in Switzerland.\n\u201cIf US experts don\u2019t change their minds again, like they did several days ago, and don\u2019t put any new suggestions on the table, the chance is high that we will come up with a plan on how to settle the situation in eastern Aleppo by withdrawing all militants, without any exceptions,\u201d he said."}

Chez TJ joined the neighborhood in the early 1980s when it opened in a historic Victorian home that features stone architecture and massive windows.\nDuring the more than three decades Chez TJ has been in business, it has helped change the way people in the area view French cuisine. Not only has the restaurant gradually adapted to the trends in the culinary landscape, but it has also helped develop the food scene by supporting local farmers and being one of the first restaurants to source the majority of its ingredients from local Peninsula growers. For each of the last eight years, Chez TJ has earned a Michelin Star rating.\nMany restaurants have been successful at bringing the French dining experience to the masses in the United States, but the most successful ones unite French cuisine with contemporary American influences.\nContemporary French cuisine is a modernization of the old French luxury dining, incorporating flavors and ingredients that are more popular in today\u2019s society. Instead of relying on processed meats and organs, Chez TJ and other contemporary French restaurants focus on farm-to-table vegetables, fresh cheeses and a lighter palate than traditional French fine dining.\nEating at Chez TJ is unlike dining anywhere else in the Bay Area. The chefs are so passionate about the quality of their ingredients and creation of their dishes. Chef Jarad Gallagher visits local markets every day to make sure that his raw ingredients are fresh, and he sources some of the best local organic produce to make sure that all of his food has flavor and health benefits.\nOne of the most popular experiences at Chez TJ is the eight course prix fixe menu, a three-hour tasting experience that will take you through dishes Gallagher creates daily based on what is in season. It is an absolutely memorable experience for romantic couples or business colleagues.\nAtmosphere is important at any restaurant, and Chez TJ has an eclectic setup that is different from other restaurants offering fine dining experiences. Instead of being led into a massive dining room with impersonal d\u00e9cor, patrons are seated in one of four rooms in this Victorian mansion. They are treated to personal service that makes it seem as though they are part of the restaurant\u2019s family. This means Chez TJ can\u2019t handle large groups as easily as banquet halls and larger restaurants, but it allows a more focused approach to the dish creation and to the attention the chef is able to devote to each individual guest.\nArticle presented by Alain Pinel Realtors.

So I visit primary schools every so often to have environmental awareness talks with the pupils. Some days, we plant flowers around the school and have pupils adopt them.\nYes, the government has its role, but putting up litter bins is not enough. Citizens have to understand the role they play in keeping the environment clean. Getting people to fund the project is also a problem because the results are not tangible, yet most people prefer to contribute to causes where the results are physically tangible.\n\u201cI have an undergraduate degree in microbiology and biotechnology. I was set for a career in the health care or pharmaceutical industry. Then just before graduation, I took up a part-time job as a waitress at a restaurant. While here, I got to meet an interesting breed of people. People who seemed utterly content with their lives and happy with their jobs. I knew that the path my degree was taking me towards would not make me happy, so I quit the waitressing job and took some time to do some soul-searching. It opened my eyes to just how dirty Nairobi was, so I immediately registered my foundation and went back to school for a master\u2019s in environmental planning and management to get the skills I needed.\n\u201cIt has been three years now and my team of four and I have done 25 environmental clean-ups in Nairobi. Every day is another chance to reduce littering and promote better waste management. My programme is community-based.\n\u201cI am up at 6am every morning to do the house chores before setting out for work. I spend most of my days in meetings trying to talk people round to partnering with me in my initiative. In three years, I have recruited 2, 000 volunteers. The youngest volunteer is 16 and the oldest, 40. The most fulfilling part is knowing that in addition to cleaning the environment, I am helping clean up their minds. I source most of the volunteers on social media.\n\u201cThe greatest challenge has been changing the \u201ctunaomba serikali\u201d mentality, where Kenyans absolve themselves from taking responsibility for anything, and instead expect the government to do everything. Yes, the government has its role, but putting up litter bins is not enough. Citizens have to understand the role they play in keeping the environment clean. Getting people to fund the project is also a problem because the results are not tangible, yet most people prefer to contribute to causes where the results are physically tangible.\n\u201cThere are days that what I am doing feels insignificant. Reminding myself that it is actually important even when I can\u2019t see the results, is what keeps me going. Eventually I want to go beyond litter.

They, along with their stylists, are thinking of new ways to work weather-proof clothing into their outfits, thus creating standout street style. The resulting iterations aren't hard to recreate. With a few pulls and tugs, we're adding these new styles to our wardrobe arsenal, keeping our winter wardrobe hot, even when it's cold outside.\nCase in point: Kim Kardashian's off-shoulder trench. The star adds to the sultry and mysterious notes of the classic garment by wearing nothing under, and pulling the shoulders down to reveal her d\u00e9colletage. The belt keeps the new structure in place, so she doesn't need to use the buttons. Unbuttoned, the star reveals her graphic thigh-high boots and redefines the meaning of the coat dress.\nChrissy Teigen takes a more subtle and popular approach while shopping on a rainy day. Instead having to take the coat on and off, the star drapes her coat over her shoulders, concealing her arms. Whether or not this style is warmer, this unconventional way of wearing outerwear actually seems more convenient for a busy shopper. Without the arms, the style also allows a better view of the outfit underneath. So, if you really love the T-shirt you're wearing, this iteration is the perfect alternative.\nBlake Lively is a fan of the no-arm trend as well, but adds to the style by adding another layer. Why wear one coat when you can wear two? Double coating is a perfect way to stay warm while looking like street style royalty. The key is to either match the hue or pattern of both coats like the actress, or contrast the colors (See: Kelly Rowland's double coating style). Either way, this addition makes a big impact.\nAccording to Sofia Richie, your outerwear doesn't always have to go over your outfit. The model wears her three-toned Puma jacket under her overalls with heeled ankle boots for a feminine touch. Beyond ditching the standard layering sequence, she opts out of the one of the overall straps to display more of the jacket\u2014pretty genius. The style is warm with layers, chic with its approach and a winter go-to for the overall lover.\nWhich style will you try this season? Tell us below!"}
