{"idx": "20005", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: So, is cyber insurance worth it? Is it right for your company? What type of coverage should you get? How much is enough? And what are the gotchas to watch out for?\nThe first point to understand is that standard business insurance does not cover data breaches or almost any other loss involving data. Standard insurance covers tangible losses and damage. Data isn't tangible.\nFor that distinction you can thank American Guarantee & Liability Insurance Co. vs. Ingram Micro Inc., a U.S. District Court ruling in Arizona in 2000. The court said that a computer outage caused by a power problem constituted physical damage within the meaning of the policy Ingram Micro had purchased from American Guarantee.\n\"After that, the insurance firms changed their policies to state that data is not considered tangible property,\" says Kevin Kalinich, national managing director for network risk at insurance vendor Aon Risk Solutions. The upshot is that an enterprise needs special cyber insurance to cover data-related issues. The problem is that the field is new and there is no such thing as standard coverage with a standard price.\nThe resulting complexity is a major source of push-back by potential buyers, according to Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute, a research organization focused on information security and protection.\n\"The policies have limitations and constraints similar to home policies with act-of-God provisions, and that has created a lot of uncertainty about what is covered, and what the risks are,\" Ponemon says. \"Those who are nevertheless purchasing cyber insurance are typically very selective about what coverage they want,\" he adds.\nData breach coverage: This pays for expenses that result from a data breach. Covered expenses typically include notification of the victims, setting up a call center, credit monitoring and credit restoration services for the victims, and other crisis management services, says Ken Goldstein, vice president at the Chubb Group, an insurance vendor. \"You might want to hire forensic experts, independent attorneys for guidance concerning the multiple state (data breach notification) laws, and public relations experts. The more thoughtful ones respond in a way that shows they are taking the situation seriously,\" he says.\nRegulatory civil action coverage: Pays in cases where the insured is facing fines from a state attorney general after a data breach, or from the federal government after a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA,) or similar regulations. Some policies only cover the cost of defending against the action, while others may pay the fine as well, says Steven Haase, head of INSUREtrust, an Atlanta-based specialty insurance provider.\nCyber extortion coverage: For cases where a hacker steals data from the policy holder and then tries to sell it back, or someone plants a logic bomb in the policy holder's system and demands payment to disable it. Among other things, the policy should cover the cost of a negotiator, and the expense of offering a reward leading to the arrest of the perpetrator, Goldstein says.\nVirus liability: Pays in cases where the policy holder is sued by someone who claims to have gotten a virus from the policy holder's system.\nContent liability: Covers lawsuits filed by people angered over something posted on the Web site of the policy holder. Such coverage should also cover copyright claims and domain name disputes, Haase says.\nLost income coverage: Replaces revenue lost while the policy holder's computer system or Web site is down. But Kalinich notes that insurers often apply minimum downtimes of 12 or 24 hours, or require proof of actual losses. \"They'll say that, after all, the"}

It sounds somewhat dangerous, but Ed Helms made sure to note that everyone was okay when all was said and done.\nThe concern over safety was probably a big issue on the set of Tag, as the production did not entirely go off without a hitch. Specifically, Jeremy Renner suffered two broken arms while filming a stunt in the movie, the details of which sound particularly gruesome. That said, despite The Avengers star's misfortune, nothing bad happened when the time came to go wild on those carts.\nIf you want a closer look at our chat with Ed Helms, check out a clip from the Tag interview below!\nBased on a true story, Tag tells the tale of a group of friends who have been playing the same game of Tag every May for the last three decades.

As the US begins to scale back on foreign operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Obama administration is finding less of a need for the servicemen and women that have been on the battlefronts for the last decade. In order to cut costs, the new budget will thus eliminate positions from the armed forces and initiate changes to the pension and health care plans for military vets.\nCiting the end of the war in Iraq and a drawdown of troops in Afghanistan, the president said Thursday that the US must strategize on how to successfully prepare for future conflicts. In order to do such, said Obama, boots on the ground will be needed less and less. Instead, the US will rely more heavily on an agile, dispersed arsenal of troops and increased surveillance space age weaponry presence.\nPresident Obama said that the move to scale back personnel comes after decimating al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership, progressing in Afghanistan and a successful mission to protect the Libyan people and assist in the overthrowing of the Gaddafi regime.

When I came to Cornell, it was the first time I really started to understand the purpose and value of feminism and then share that purpose and value publicly. However, I never stopped to ask myself, \u201cWhy have my beliefs turned into a self-assigned label?\u201d After reflecting on this question I realized that I call myself a feminist because I want others to know that I recognize the persisting inequality. I call myself a feminist to bring awareness to the fact that gender has real impact on available opportunities. I call myself a feminist in the hopes that another feels comfortable doing the same so that together we can engage in a dialogue and action to fight for equality. But I\u2019ve come to see that it\u2019s not enough to give myself this label; I have to push myself to live up to it and make it better.\nIf I want my label as a feminist to say that I recognize inequality, that means I have an obligation to see inequality beyond that which may impact me. It means that I have to understand the nuances of inequality as it impacts different women of different races, backgrounds and identities differently. It means that I have to understand that all women experience unique challenges and triumphs and while I fight for my voice to be heard, it must not drown out the voices of the women beside me. I do not know enough to speak for other women and I have not experienced enough to speak for other women. And I will never know enough nor ever experience enough to speak for other women. So I will not. I will, however, use my feminist label, my voice and my privilege to create space for other women to be heard and to find allies. This need to create space is not rooted in a savior mentality, but rather a mentality that refuses to ignore my privilege. I will use my voice to call out injustice because fear of saying the wrong thing does not excuse silence.\nWe are in the midst of a new wave of the feminism and it is riding a similar tide as the Black Lives Matter movement. Throughout history, racial equality and gender equality have progressed on similar timelines, but too often women of color were shut out of the feminist movement. Even when they were \u201cwelcome,\u201d women of color were forced to choose between their gender and their race because the feminist movement only spoke with one voice. It did not create space for voices to talk about the intersectionality of race and gender. So I recognize that the women who came before me fought for my seat in a college classroom, but I also recognize that there are too many women of color on college campuses who are forced to feel unsafe or unwelcome in the classroom due to threats, intimidation and persistent lack of diversity.\nThe goal of the feminist movement is to ensure that all genders are politically, economically and socially equal. But this goal is not possible if we allow certain conditions to persist. Equality for some is not equality. Therefore, feminism for some is not feminism. And so I will work to be a better feminist, to live up to the label and to make it better. I understand that while all women are different and have different goals, there is a common thread of sisterhood that binds us. I must do my part to stand in solidarity with my sisters in order to keep that thread sewn.\nJennifer Mandelblatt is a junior in the ILR School.

But it's also raised uneasy questions about claims of sexual harrasment made by women against the director and how the media frames the legacy of 'great' men.\nHomages from politicians and artists have spoken to the extraordinary life and artistic achievements of Lanzmann, the man behind the searing Holocaust documentary \u2018Shoah\u2019, that many critics say changed the history of cinema. Amid the acclaim, however, some feminists and female journalists have expressed a disquiet and frustration over what they view as the media\u2019s singular reverence for a man who throughout his career was dogged by allegations of sexual harassment.\nAmong those critical of the media\u2019s handling of Lanzmann\u2019s legacy is French journalist and feminist Alice Coffin, who published a blog about the French media\u2019s failure to acknowledge those allegations in the numerous obituaries penned since his death. She says the silence surrounding these aspects of the filmmaker\u2019s life have proven even more glaring in the wake of the #MeToo movement and its exposure of the prevalence of abuses of power, many of them by high-profile men.\nShe reserves her strongest criticism for the language French journalists used to describe Lanzmann\u2019s relationships with women, which she says whitewashes the more damning claims of abuse made against him. Coffin points to phrases such as a \u2018seducer of women\u2019 and a \u2018man who loved women\u2019, that she says are little more than euphemisms that mask widely publicised incidents of inappropriate behaviour towards women.\nIn 2017, Dutch journalist Joyce Roodnat wrote an article claiming she was groped and harassed by Lanzmann during an interview with him in Paris in 1985. She said she was so overawed by the director and was concerned about losing her job at the newspaper that she didn\u2019t complain at the time.\nThen last year, Roodnat was emboldened by the #MeToo movement to speak publicly of this ordeal during a panel discussion on Amsterdam television. Since telling her story, Roodnat says there have been times when she\u2019s been villified.\nShe told FRANCE 24 that like the media in France, the Dutch press had overlooked the many stories about Lanzmann\u2019s treatment of women and how her own newspaper, NRC, initially ommitted from an obituary any mention of past allegations of harrassment, even though the newspaper had published Roodnat\u2019s own story of her encounter with the director. She said a female editor-in-chief later called her to apologise: the obituary was amended to include a link to Roodnat\u2019s story and a line stating that insofar as women were concerned \u201cit did not always end up well\u201d for Lanzmann.\nRoodnat does not believe the media were necessarily deliberate in circumventing pernicious details relating to women\u2019s claims of harassment, but she believes it is because these stories stain the admiration of important men, like Lanzmann, that they are often handled with silence.\n\u201cSo people might feel something deeply because the man or artist they admire has helped them know their feelings, and then suddenly he has a stain [against his name] and they just don\u2019t want to know about it because they would have to forget how this person helped them connect with these feelings,\u201d she explains.\nCoffin believes there is still much work to be done to change attitudes in France and particularly within the media.

The organization\u2019s funders include the beer company Anheuser-Busch and the tobacco company Reynolds American, federal disclosures show. The ads and the donations were first reported by Alaska Public Radio Network.\nIndependent expenditure groups, a byproduct of a 2010 Supreme Court decision, run campaigns separately from candidates. They can raise unlimited amounts of money and constantly find new niches.\nThis may be the first time, however, that such a group has run ads in an Anchorage School Board race, said Marc Hellenthal, a longtime Anchorage political consultant whose firm handled the ads featuring Mystrom.\n\u201cSchool board races normally aren\u2019t on the radar,\u201d Hellenthal said. The races are technically nonpartisan, though parties often get involved in fundraising, messaging and voter outreach.\nFamilies of the Last Frontier formed in 2018, backed by funds from a different national Republican group. The group ran ads boosting then-Sen. Pete Kelly\u2019s unsuccessful re-election campaign. Negative ads targeted the Democratic candidate, Scott Kawasaki.\nThe group\u2019s chairman, Anchorage Republican activist Steve Strait, said in an interview that Families of the Last Frontier decided it wasn\u2019t finished, and isn\u2019t limiting itself to certain types of elections. He said the group decided to get involved in the school board races after hearing disappointment from parents about the Anchorage School District.\n\u201cWhen you just see the amount of money that goes into the school system, and the poor performance ... what does it take to make a change here?\u201d Strait said.\nStrait referenced a January study on state school performance by the Alaska Policy Form, a conservative think tank for which Nees has worked for years as a volunteer. Families of the Last Frontier has not yet spent money on Anchorage Assembly races, records show.\nStrait said he couldn\u2019t speak to the specific reasons for national Republican involvement in this campaign.

Many want the enormously popular president reinstated.\nNearly everyone at the Charlottesville campus thought Sullivan was off to a promising start. She spent her first year in office installing an estimable team of top administrators and her second year strengthening the university\u2019s academic model, just as she had been tasked by the board that hired her.\nBut at least one key player did not agree: Helen Dragas, a savvy, fiscally conservative developer from Virginia Beach appointed to the board in 2008 by then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) and promoted to rector of the 16-person board last summer. Her misgivings about Sullivan would pit the university\u2019s first female rector against its first female president.\nThe following account is based on conversations with more than a dozen current and former board members, state and university officials, faculty and others with direct knowledge of the events. Some spoke on the record; others did not, saying they were not authorized to speak. Board members referred inquiries to Dragas, who said she cannot discuss personnel matters.\nDragas had reservations about Sullivan from the start, the sources said. By the time she took the reins as rector, Dragas was becoming convinced that Sullivan would not make the hard spending decisions necessary to keep U-Va. competitive in a volatile higher education marketplace. In conversations before and since the ouster, Dragas has portrayed Sullivan as an adequate day-to-day caretaker but someone incapable of long-term vision.\nDragas laid the groundwork for Sullivan\u2019s removal over several months, working in secret with a small team of collaborators. They included vice rector Mark Kington, a venture capitalist from Alexandria and former business partner to Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), and Peter Kiernan, a New York investor who led the foundation of the university\u2019s business school.\nOn Friday, Michael Strine, U-Va.\u2019s chief operating officer and one of Sullivan\u2019s top deputies, read a statement at a staff meeting to quell rumors that he, too, was involved in her removal. He acknowledged meeting with members of the governing board and said they posed critical questions about Sullivan. He said he told the board members to take their concerns to Sullivan, according to two people who were there.\nThe campaign to remove Sullivan began around October, the sources said.

{"idx": "20036", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Much has been written about the Third International Math and Science Study results, the differences among Western, European, and Asian mathematics instruction, student expectations, teacher preparation, resource materials, and so on. When one \"peels away the onion\" to find out what really works well in teaching mathematics, it is no surprise that successful endeavors focus on using patterns (\"Time To Solve the Math Education Equation,\" May 6, 1998).\nThe brain is a pattern-seeking organ and, as such, naturally responds to developing and extending patterns using sight and tactile senses. For students to understand the concepts behind the algorithmic bridge that is needed to solve problems, a foundation of recognizing and constructing patterns is necessary. There is no magic bullet to learning mathematics better than the way we are now, but there are proven ways to improve things. For example, we must pay close attention to the neurological research on how humans take in information and convert it to knowledge.\nClose examination of exemplary mathematics classrooms populated with average, backyard kids, reveals an environment of student and teacher modeling, pattern development and expansion, and solving real-world problems based on those ever-widening circles of intra-related geometrical or arithmetical constructs. Developing patterns this way takes a lot of time and focus, at the expense of the zillion other topics to be addressed. Teachers need substantial training in this pedagogy in order to understand that once students (or adults) learn how to recognize, develop, and extend patterns of increasing complexity, they will be able to use these keys to unlock numerous problems previously untouchable due to their strategically hidden solutions, usually embedded in some complex algorithm.\nA natural result of all of this is a compacting of the curriculum (\"less is more\" again). For example, a time-honored ritual in algebra is teaching factoring as a \"stand alone\" topic. It is no surprise that developing pattern recognition for the families of ax2+bx+c and their geometric features renders teaching all the derivations of this generality as separate pieces unnecessary.\nI served on the original Hooked on Phonics board of advisers--with pride, I must say. I thus find your article \"Reborn 'Hooked on Phonics' Switches Strategy,\" April 22, 1998, an unfair rebuke of the first edition of this program.\nFor example, it is erroneous to say that the original Hooked on Phonics did not provide \"follow-along reading activities and simple storybooks\" coordinated with its phonics instruction element. This \"reading practice\" was an integral part of its package.\nNor was this version of Hooked on Phonics unproved. In fact, it commissioned a well-designed study of its merit in Inglewood, Calif., the findings of which were collected and analyzed independently. Parents and principals were amazed at the reading growth of the low-income children in this investigation.\nOn the other hand, it is true to say that the advertising campaign of the beginning Hooked on Phonics was deliberately offensive to the reading-instruction establishment (especially the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English), which was strongly committed to experimentally unverified \"whole language\" teaching. These Hooked on Phonics ads revealed to the nation the learning-to-read disaster that whole-language instruction causes. It correctly described how direct and systematic teaching of phonics information produces the greatest written-word-recognition skill possible.\nThen, suddenly, with no warning, the Federal Trade Commission announced to the mass media that the many testimonials from satisfied customers, released by"}

In return for a monthly fee (or none at all), streaming services present customers with the ability to listen to pretty much any music ever created, as much, or as little, as they like. Some services, for a limited time only, possess the exclusive rights to albums \u2013 meaning they are literally the only place you can listen to your favourite artist\u2019s latest release. It is no surprise then, that music streaming services have become so popular. But with such a proliferation of music streaming services to pick from, which one offers the best listening experience?\nApple\u2019s assault on the music streaming industry has been relentless. By stockpiling a bevy of exclusives from some of the world\u2019s most popular and in-demand artists, Apple Music has been able to eat into Spotify\u2019s stranglehold on paid streaming. Is there much to Apple Music beyond the exclusives though?\nA good deal of Apple Music\u2019s strength also lies in the quality of its weekly, personalised playlists. Comprised of a favourites mix, a chill mix, and a new music mix, the \u2018For You\u2019 selections are invariably great. The 24 hour Beats radio, hosted by prominent names in the world of music like Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden, is equally strong.\nWhere Apple Music falls down is through its \u2018connect\u2019 tab, which is a poor and under-utilised proto-social network that is close to redundant. The service is set to slow down on the exclusives that compelled so many users to subscribe in the first place, and the surge of investment into video isn\u2019t likely to change the service for the better for music lovers. Add to that the complication of Apple Music only existing within iTunes on PC, and there are some areas for improvement and refinement.\nSpotify is the original streaming service. And it is in part thanks to this status that it has become the largest paid streaming service. Impressively, it has over twice as many subscribers as its nearest competitor Apple Music. But are Spotify\u2019s 50 million paying subscribers indicative of quality?\nFor the most part, yes. Like its competitors, it gives users access to millions of tracks and playlists, as well as its own radio offering. As users consume more and more music, Spotify will also get better and better at understanding your taste and suggesting suitable recommendations. What differentiates Spotify from the rest is the ability to see what your friends are listening to, which is further bolstered by Spotify\u2019s integration into Facebook. And what fun is music without friends to share it with?\nThe negatives of Spotify are few are far between. A lack of lyrics is one. On Apple Music, lyrics are provided for close to every song. On Spotify, not so much.\nDespite Soundcloud posting losses in the tens of millions mark recently, it remains one of, if not the biggest streaming service, with approximately 175 million active monthly users. Unlike the likes of Spotify or Apple Music, Soundcloud does not have an extensive catalogue of music from the most popular artists and is instead mostly reliant on upcoming artists electing to use the platform to publish their music.\nBecause of this, the diversity of music Soundcloud offers is unrivalled. The emphasis on community is infinitely more apparent on Soundcloud than with any of its competitors. User feedback is rife, as it pops up at each second of a playing song, and the capability for artists to follow each other, repost and like each other\u2019s songs further fosters the sense of community.

But Skourletis said Tsipras should move faster. \"I would say elections first, then the party congress,\" he said.\nCalling elections in September means the vote will be held before voters start feeling the new bailout measures including further pension cuts, more value-added tax increases and a \"solidarity\" tax on incomes.\nKnock-on effects of capital controls imposed in June, which are likely to stay until Greek banks are recapitalized later this year with bailout funds, will also hurt voters.\nThe other option had been to delay the vote till October, after international creditors have reviewed Greece&apos;s performance in keeping to the bailout program.

Scores on those two tests came in much lower than expected this spring.\nBut the board made no changes to expectations on other state tests, despite a passionate plea from board member A.J. Wagner of Dayton to lower expectations across the board to insure that students can graduate.\nWagner told the board that about 40 percent of high school students are not scoring well enough on required tests to graduate from high school. Some students, he said, will respond to demands that they work harder and score better, but others won't.\n\"All I hear is more rigor, more rigor, and they'll try harder,\" Wagner said. \"But what if they don't?\"\n\"I'm worried about those kids,\" he said. \"I don't know where they go.\"\nSee below for more details on the scores and the exact graduation requirements in question.\nBoard member Mary Rose Oakar said that students from poor neighborhoods have a harder time learning and passing tests than those in suburbs. She wants a system that is fair to them.\n\"What can schools do for these kids?\" she asked. \"What do you do to motivate these kids? Do you take them out of their home life?\"\nOthers objected to lowering expectations. The state has raised them in an effort to make students be more prepared for college or careers before graduating.\nBoard member Todd Jones opposed lower standards to make sure everyone earns a diploma. That would leave standards so low, he said, that a diploma wouldn't signify much.\n\"It's the trophies-for-all movement,\" Jones said, arguing against more changes. \"It's that we have to assure that everyone gets a diploma and they don't mean anything.\"\nStudents, he said, will adjust if expectations on the tests stay high. They can take classes again, get tutoring and take the tests again to earn better scores.\n\"They're going to re-take it and re-take it and get remediation,\" he said.\nChad Wyen, superintendent of the Mad River school district, told the board that his district has raised graduation rates over the last 15 years, despite its poverty rate doubling from 35 percent to 70 percent.\n\"That can't be an excuse,\" he said. Schools should find the right support for students.\n\"Please give the standards a chance to work,\" Wyen said. \"Let the process work its way out..If you decide to roll back expectations, it's our kids that will be hurt the most.\"\nWyen was part of a group of educators from the Dayton area that stressed the need"}

Butterfly pea flower tea or blue tea is rich in antioxidants, great for heart health, and keeps your skin glowing. Here\u2019s what you need to know about it.\n* Antioxidant properties: One of the benefits of drinking blue tea is that it has a lot of antioxidants. These powerful bio-compounds help the body fight free radicals which are toxic and cause premature ageing. It is a good idea to detox the body once in a while with an antioxidant-rich drink like blue pea tea.\n* Anti-diabetic properties: A cup of blue butterfly tea taken in between meals will inhibit the intake of glucose from the diet and lower blood sugar. Antioxidants in the tea also help the body lower risk of infections, which diabetics are prone to, and it is also great for your heart health.\n* For hair, skin: The antioxidants in a cup of blue tea are great for hair and skin. This tea also has many vitamins and minerals which keep your skin and hair looking great, as it keeps them from ageing prematurely.\n* Energises and boosts brain activity: Blue pea is proven to be nootropic. It refreshes the brain and boosts its activity and function. This will keep you energised and feeling great.\n* Treats anxiety and depression: According to studies, blue tea can relieve stress and lower symptoms of anxiety disorder.\n* Magnifies beauty: Blue pea flower has anti-glycation properties, which is excellent for the skin and helps prevent skin ageing. Furthermore, blue tea has some flavonoids which increase collagen origination, accelerating skin elasticity. It is also good for your hair as it contains anthocyanin, which increases blood flow in the scalp, strengthening hair follicles.\n* Lowers the risk of cancer: Blue pea flowers are a rich source of antioxidants. Antioxidants are known to minimise the damage to the cells of the body. The lesser the damage to cells, the lesser the risk of all types of cancer.\n* Treats diabetes: According to a study, clitoria ternatea leaf is found to lower diabetes in rats. It obstructs glucose intake from food and is beneficial for curing type II diabetes."}

{"idx": "20052", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The clock measuring the one year allowed for the treasure trove search at Victorio Peak will begin ticking on May 15.\nThat is one of the first things spelled out in the Army\u00b4s licensing agreement which was signed April 4 by Terry Delonas and Brig. Gen. Ronald Hite. Delonas signed for the Ova Noss Family Partnership and Hite, as commanding general of WSMR, signed for the Department of Army.\nIn addition to the timeframe, the 16-page document limits the search area to a one mile radius of Victorio Peak, says the exploration will be without cost to the Government and the work will not interfere with other missile range activities. There also are paragraphs and subparagraphs outlining a variety of requirements ranging from a $200,000 deposit to lists of treasure locations and on-site participants.\nThe agreement goes to some length to make a distinction between what constitutes treasure versus artifacts. Paragraph 12 states, \"All archeological resources, antiquities, or items of historical or cultural interest....whenever located on WSMR shall remain the property of the Government.\"\nAfter this statement there is a long laundry list of what might be considered an artifact. It includes such common items as mortars, baskets, pottery, rock carvings, arrow heads and jewelry. The list was obviously lifted from a generic license because it includes, \"all portions of shipwrecks.\" It seems unlikely a shipwreck will be found within Victorio Peak.\nNow for the interesting part. The paragraph goes on to define \"treasure\" as \"coins, gold or silver bullion, precious metals (not including metals with radioactive value), precious cut and uncut gems (not including jewelry or gems set in valuable ornaments), unset and loose jewels, and related valuables.\"\nSo, what happens if anything is found? The agreement says the partnership will cease operations immediately. Together, representatives of WSMR and the partnership will make a written and photographic inventory. The two parties will then categorize items as artifacts or treasure or neither with WSMR having the final determination in the matter.\nArtifacts will then be dealt with by WSMR according to federal law. Treasure will be removed by the partnership under the direction of WSMR personnel.\nAt the signing Delonas said they were checking on vault storage with several banks in the area just in case something is discovered.\nAfter removing the treasure, if any is found, the Department of Army will take custody of it. Following another inventory, the Army will, through the Department of Justice, go to the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico and request a determination as to the ownership of the treasure. Any subsequent court proceedings will certainly be fodder for the \"entertainment-news\" programs.\nAnother interesting requirement of the license is that \"neither the Licensee nor any individual or company shall sell participation interests in the project contemplated by this license or in any manner utilize this license to promote the sale of stock or other securities or effect the financing of such project without first disclosing such transaction(s) to the Secretary of the Army.\" This portion of the license is intended to prevent anyone from implying that the Army endorses or backs the search.\nTo control the site and prevent any possible misrepresentation or fraud, all representatives of the partnership must consent \"to a thorough search of their persons, vehicles, equipment, and any other personal property by Government security personnel.\" This includes a search prior to entry to the area or entry into any cavern or tunnel and a search on returning or emerging.\nAfter the signing, Delonas said he"}
{"idx": "20053", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Piper Laurie and Brooke Adams appear in Melanie Mayron's drama about a long-ago affair between two married women.\nA forbidden romance is sensitively depicted in Snapshots, Melanie Mayron's drama featuring Piper Laurie as an elderly woman who becomes reminded of her past via a vintage camera. That the film's screenplay, co-written by Jan Miller Corran and Katherine Cortez, is based on real-life events adds a poignant element to this indie feature benefiting from excellent performances by its largely female cast.\nThe film begins with a reunion of three generations of family members at a lakeside house, including 85-year-old Rose (Laurie), her daughter Patty (Brooke Adams) and her granddaughter Allison (Emily Baldoni). There's considerable tension between Patty, heavily drinking since the death of her husband who was having an affair with his secretary, and Allison, secretly pregnant and wondering if she's still in love with her spouse.\nWhen Allison presents her grandmother with Rose's old Brownie camera Allison's recently found, the gift unleashes a flood of memories. The action shifts many decades earlier to the 1960s, when the young newlywed Rose (Shannon Collis) is vacationing during the summer at a lakeside house with her husband, Joe (Max Adler). There she meets Louise (Emily Goss), a photographer living nearby with her husband, Zee (Brett Dier).\nIt doesn't take long for Louise to make known her romantic feelings for Rose, who finds herself irresistibly drawn to the free-spirited bohemian. Although initially far too conventional and reserved to reciprocate, Rose eventually throws caution to the wind and embarks on a torrid affair, conducted behind both husbands' backs. The secret relationship lasts for years, with Louise at one point pressing Rose to leave her husband and move away with her to some city where they could forge a life together.\nThe film is much stronger in the flashback sections than the present-day interludes, although both are occasionally marred by clunky, cliched dialogue. When Louise first comes on to her physically, the flustered Rose asks, \"What are you doing?\" \"What I've wanted to do since I first saw you,\" Louise responds, having apparently seen too many bad romantic movies. At another point, during a discussion of lesbianism, Patty declares, 'I don't like the idea of it, it's gross,\" as her mother visibly blanches. Not long afterward, Allison confesses that she's having an affair with another woman, a plot element that inevitably feels schematic.\nDespite those occasional missteps, Snapshots presents a moving portrait of its central relationship doomed by societal constrictions. The female characters are well-drawn and vibrant, while the men are depicted sympathetically. Collis and Goss deliver affectingly soulful, sensuous performances that vividly convey their characters' passion for each other, while Laurie is quietly touching as the elderly woman who lost the love of her life without ever being able to tell anyone about it.\nMayron infuses the proceedings with a hazy glow that provides a warmly nostalgic atmosphere. And while the pacing can be a little too leisurely at times, it doesn't prevent Snapshots from being a mature, reflective drama that is all the more effective for its restraint."}

We saw many amazing things on our trip to Spain, and one of my favorite things to do was check out their gardens and public parks. I really enjoyed comparing their landscaping and plants to ours.\nWe spent time in Madrid and Barcelona, both large, historic metropolitan cities with a surprisingly significant amount of parkland and green space. The Parque del Buen Retiro (literally, \"Park of the Pleasant Retreat\") in the heart of Madrid covers 350 acres. With a lake in the center, the park includes wide pedestrian walkways lined with crafts and artisans and entertainers and filled with walkers, bicyclists and inline skaters. Only blocks away lies the botanical garden, the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico, home to seemingly limitless garden displays. Barcelona has similar large parks and gardens including the Parc de la Ciutadella, Jard\u00ed Bot\u00e0nic and Parc G\u00fcell, filled with Antoni Gaud\u00ed artwork and whimsical sculpture.\nSpain has a typical Mediterranean landscape. And like Texas, it has a very diverse topography - from arid desertlike scrub, rolling hills and mountainous regions to lush tropical and coastal areas awash in balmy Mediterranean breezes. It also includes the Balearic Islands of Mallorca, Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera.\nIn recent years, American gardeners have been turning more often to the Mediterranean style of landscaping, and our travels in Spain showed me why.\nModern landscape design has its roots in the ancient civilizations of the area. The Mediterranean style of gardening reflects the easygoing culture and pairs beautiful elements of nature in an elegant style. While the gardens have an orderly and graceful style, they are far from formal. Geometric designs, straight lines and stonework are used to frame a broad range of plants, from soft, flowing petals to linear shrubs and trees to anchor the garden. It's not uncommon to see flowers, herbs, fruit trees, palms and succulents all in the same garden.\nWith its varied climate zones, Spain is home to more than 8,000 plant species. Texas enjoys approximately 5,500. We share many of the same plants as European gardeners.\nDramatic cordylines and palms of all sizes are incorporated into most landscapes, parks and public areas. Olive, cypress and retama trees scatter the countryside. Beautiful bougainvilleas in all colors climb walls and fences along with mandevillas and fragrant jasmine.\nFlowering bushy shrubs include hibiscus, lantana, oleander, plumbago and angel's trumpet. And to provide the textural contrast that's so appealing in Mediterranean gardens, there are all the grasses, cacti, agaves and succulents - plants that have been our staples here in recent drought-stricken years.\nOur experience in Spain was rich in very different culture, history, architecture and food. But it was also nice to see some familiar plants across the ocean decorating the beautiful Mediterranean landscape.\nA Master Gardener, Diana Kirby is a landscape designer and garden coach.

So this week in Las Vegas, HPE is showing off innovations meant to keep it a step ahead.\nEssential to HPE software-defined infrastructure enhancements is HPE OneView 3.1, which will support the company's Gen 10 servers. \"OneView is a huge enabler of our composablity; that\u2019s really the software behind how we take pieces of server storage networking as a fluid resource that can be composed,\" said Doug Strain, server management product manager at HPE.\nAmong enhancements to OneView is intelligent system tuning, which allows systems to boost processor performance for certain workloads while also modulating frequency using a technique known as jitter smoothing. Jitter smoothing helps ensure that data is not lost while boosting core performance. This enables trading systems in which trade data can not be lost, for example, to take advantage of core boosting when high performance is required.\nThe new version of OneView also offers more than a dozen preset workload settings to make it easier for customers to tune systems for certain types of applications. The feature includes presets for low latency, graphics processing, web e-commerce and virtualized power-efficient workloads.\nHPE is also pushing the boundaries on persistent memory technology, which brings together the performance of DRAM with the persistence of flash. The company essentially has combined a layer of DRAM, a layer of flash and an integrated power source -- a Smart Storage Battery that sits behind the drive cage and plugs into the motherboard through memory slots.\nUp to now, HPE has been offering persistent memory in the form of NVDIMM modules, which fit into standard server DIMM slots. Applications in NVDIMM can run much faster in persistent memory than they do in standard block storage devices since data doesn't have to move back and forth between the CPU and the hard drive, for example. Data is also retained if a server crashes.\nHPE is announcing at Discover that capacity on NVDIMM modules will be expanded from 8GB to 16GB. But the big advance, also set to be demonstrated this week, will come with terabyte-scalable persistent memory that resides right on the memory bus.\n\"When you start getting up into terabyte level persistent memory you are starting to open the door for different use cases,\" says Bret Gibbs, HPE's persistent memory product manager.\nWhile NVDIMMS can handle smaller databases, transaction logs and index files, scalable persistent memory can handle"}

Isn\u2019t it amazing that when Trump becomes president or when George W. Bush becomes president, all of a sudden the DOJ becomes this hands off well-boundaried institution that the president cannot have any say-so in. The president cannot have a thing to say about what goes on in there. He can\u2019t talk to Jeff Sessions. He can\u2019t talk to the deputy attorney general, he has nothing. He doesn\u2019t understand it, the left says, but the Department of Justice is independent. It must be for a decent and fair America.\nRight. That\u2019s how they portray it when they don\u2019t control it. When they don\u2019t control it, it means the Republicans have to be warned and bullied into staying away from it. Because the Democrats own the Department of Justice."}

For that matter, we are not even sure if the drug will work.\nST-246, a pill to be manufactured by Siga Technologies, Inc., would come into play as a second level of defense in the event of a smallpox attack. Currently, the nation has stockpiled some $1 billion in smallpox vaccines, enough to inoculate the entire U.S. population and treat those who have contracted the disease.\nBut there is the catch. The vaccine is only effective if provided within four days after the disease is contracted.\nAnd that is where ST-246 comes into play. According to Siga Technologies, the pill would save the lives of those afflicted with smallpox that are not treated within the four day window.\nYet, we are not sure the treatment will work. Ethical considerations (we do not permit healthy people to be infected with a dose of smallpox) prohibit testing the drug on humans and successful testing on animals is no guarantee that human recipients will respond in the same way. Because the limited testing of such a drug on animals only would not meet the requirements for FDA approval, there is a very strong likelihood that the drug will never achieve the needed FDA go ahead to be placed into service.\nDr. Donald A Henderson, the research physician who led the global eradication of smallpox for the World Health Organization and would later go on to organize U.S. biodefense efforts under President George W. Bush, doesn\u2019t think this is a level of protection that we require.\nWe've got a vaccine that I hope we never have to use \u2014 how much more do we need?\nHenderson is not alone in his skepticism. Other top-notch epidemiologists, such as Dr. Thomas Mack of the Keck School of Medicine, added that the drug is a waste of time and money.\nStill, if this were simply a matter of a policy disagreement, the story would likely end here with people forming their own opinion as to whether this added protection is beneficial or simply expensive overkill.\nBut it does not end here- not by a long shot.\nIt turns out that the drug manufacturer\u2019s controlling shareholder is Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire whose portfolio has included everything from Marvel Entertainment to Revlon and is a long-time major contributor to the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates.\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have worked for Mr. Perelman in the past. I can, therefore, say from personal experience that Mr. Perelman, while a very substantial Democratic contributor, has also given large sums of money to Republican candidates over the years.\nWith this factor resting in the background, the story begins to take on some strange, and suspicious, elements.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, having determined that the drug was a needed addition to our bio-terrorism arsenal, appears to have set out to do everything possible -and more- to insure that Siga Technologies won the contract. This included blocking other firms from so much as bidding for the opportunity.\nInitially, the contract was put out to bid for small businesses- companies with less than 500 employees. Quickly, the deal was awarded to Siga Technologies. However, Chimerix Inc., a North Carolina based company that also pursued the contract, complained"}

And within a half hour or so after take-off, the rocket will return from space and attempt to guide its way, using GPS tracking, onto a droneship in the Atlantic.\nFive years ago, a landing attempt like this was unheard of. But SpaceX is changing things up and paving the way for a new era of reusable rockets. The company, founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has gone to great lengths to build the foundations for a future of cheap space travel. The key to that future is reusable rockets that can carry cargo and astronauts into space multiple times instead of only once.\nSo far, SpaceX has never recovered a rocket for reuse. But if everything goes according to plan this Sunday and the rocket lands softly, it would be a game changer.\nAnd with 17 potential rocket launches scheduled for 2015, there is plenty of opportunity to get it right even if this latest attempt doesn't work.\nThe landing attempt isn't the only exciting thing about Sunday's launch. For this launch, the rocket will also ferry an important instrument into space: the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR).\nDSCOVR, shown to the right, is the latest instrument that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will use to monitor solar winds. The sun emits gusts of high-energy particles in the form of solar wind, and when those gusts occasionally reach Earth's magnetic field it can disrupt the planet's power grids, telecommunications, aviation, and GPS.\nHaving a satellite like this is \"the first line of defense ... for us to be able to take the appropriate action to protect our system from any impacts that could happen,\" said David Velazquez, the executive vice president for Pepco Holdings Inc.\u2014 a holding company for the Potomac Electric Power Company \u2014 in a NOAA video.\nAfter the rocket detaches from DSCOVR in space, the climate observatory will begin a 110-day long journey to its final orbit while the rocket will head back toward Earth.\nThere's a special point in space, called Lagrangian Point 1, where a spacecraft can orbit so that it will always remain between the Earth and the Sun.\n\"The L1 position will provide DSCOVR with a point of 'early warning' when a surge of particles and magnetic field from the sun will hit Earth,\" NASA said in a statement. The observatory will sound the alarm 30 to 45 minutes ahead of time.\nIf the launch is aborted, SpaceX has prepared a backup launch opportunity for 6:07 p.m. on Monday.\nNASA TV will be streaming the launch live starting at 3:30 p.m. ET on Sunday.

But when Erina Ramly of Chestnut Hill, Mass., felt a tickle in her nose as she headed to the cubicle of a co-worker, she did not imagine that what happened next would lead to excruciating pain.\nShe let out a sneeze but soon afterward noticed that she couldn't turn her neck to the left or right.\nAs the pain in her neck worsened, Ramly went to see her doctor. Much to her surprise, she found out she had whiplash. She was given a neck brace to wear and some muscle relaxants for the pain.\nIn all likelihood, the sudden movement of the sneeze aggravated Ramly's neck muscles, which may have been tight to begin with because her back was feeling stiff.\n\"It felt really embarrassing, when I had to tell people the story,\" Ramly said. \"You don't expect to get whiplash from sneezing.\" But her physician told her he had seen it before, and another friend confided that it had happened to her as well.\nAlthough the chances of hurting yourself while sneezing are extremely low, it can and does happen.\nAnd it can happen to the fittest of us. Not one, but two forceful sneezes sent baseball slugger Sammy Sosa's back into spasm right before a game in 2004. Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Cubs outfielder was placed on the disabled list with a sprained ligament in his lower back.\nSneezing is a quick, sudden motion that can aggravate an underlying problem, like neck or back discomfort, explained Dr. Eric Holbrook, co-director of the sinus center at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Given the right set of circumstances, a sneeze has the potential to strain a muscle or pull a ligament.\nTraffic fatalities and accidents have also occurred when drivers have turned their head away to sneeze for a split second or have had a sneezing fit.\nIn November, for example, a Boston man lost control of his pickup truck on a curvy stretch of road adjacent to the Charles River after he reportedly sneezed while behind the wheel. The driver was not hurt during the incident but his vehicle ended up partially submerged in the river.\nOther consequences of sneezing don't necessarily lead to injury, but they can be embarrassing. For women who have incontinence, part of the pressure generated during a sneeze might transmit that pressure to the bladder, which may or may not hold, said Dr. Erin O'Brien, a sinus specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. This can also happen with a strong sneeze during pregnancy.\nSick Kids: Keep Them Home? Or Are They Faking?\nSince the average person tends to sneeze roughly 200 times a year, the odds are low of any harm, noted Dr. Michael Benninger, chairman of the head and neck institute at the Cleveland Clinic. \"The greatest risk from sneezing is contagiousness, not personal injury,\" he said.\nA sneeze often starts when an irritant enters the nose, whether it's mucus, dust or an allergen, and this stimulates the trigeminal nerve. An area of the brain called the \"sneezing center\" senses this and triggers a reflex reaction throughout the body.

The couple met Neil Bush while he was on a business trip to Singapore in 2015.\nBush solicited the donation on behalf of his brother Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, and Tang said he would be willing to do so as long it was legal.\nRight to Rise general counsel Charles Spies then sent a memo to Tang and Chen detailing various laws related to donations to super PACs, including the fact that donations can be made by subsidiaries of foreign entities as long as they are incorporated in the United States.\nDespite its foreign ownership, American Pacific is headquartered in San Francisco.\nUnder"}

As Wigfield explained to V.F. in April, she based the show on her relationship with her beloved but overbearing mother\u2014but clearly, she and her collaborators also couldn\u2019t help using it as an opportunity to revisit the sensibility and archetypes of a series that still looms large in our collective imagination, especially whenever we need to employ the perfect eye-roll GIF.\nThis might be a problem if Great News were anything short of delightful. But thankfully, the show is a fitting successor to the series that appears to have inspired it\u2014fast and funny and appealingly strange, especially now that it\u2019s past the scene-setting of Season 1.\nThe Fake News era has also given the show a perhaps inadvertent topicality that it\u2019s leaning into more overtly this year, especially after Fey shows up this season as business guru Diana St. Tropez\u2014an unholy mixture of Arianna Huffington, Sheryl Sandberg, and Jack Donaghy, who urges the show to ditch its tired talking-head format in favor of wacky shouting matches between panelists including a \u201ctrans-racial fracking misunderstander,\u201d a \u201cWiccan priestess and director of the documentary I Hate the Troops,\u201d and Rex, a gay dog.\nBut as that last bit implies, what really animates Great News is a go-for-broke silliness, the type of joke-a-minute style that whenever necessary will ditch logic in favor of punchlines.

But the 27th Congressional District, which encompasses much of the Texas Gulf Coast and goes nearly as far inland as Austin, may not be around much longer.\nThis year, a federal court in San Antonio ruled that congressional and state house districts drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2010 census, including Farenthold\u2019s, were created with the intent to discriminate against African American and Latino voters.

It keeps 15% of the revenue for its own operations.\nLast year the NTA issued a warning to German newcomer WunderCar that it would be breaking taxi licensing laws if it went ahead with plans to launch its ridesharing services in Dublin.\nThe company, which was already running in several European cities, bases its services on non-obligatory tipping of drivers for journeys booked through its app, but dropped its move into Ireland after the warning.\nWunderCar founder Gunnar Froh said the company\u2019s aim was to make travelling in a city easy by allowing people to instantly share transport but it didn\u2019t \u201cfacilitate commercial rides\u201d.\n\u201cIn a few years from now, we believe that sharing a ride in the city will be just as common as it is today to take the bus,\u201d he said.\nRecent figures from the European Commission showed Irish people favoured cars more than anyone else in the EU except for residents of Cyprus.\nRidesharing advocates argue their services help take cars off the road and clear congestion by making more efficient use of the available resources, as well as saving users money.\nMeanwhile, global juggernaut Uber has also been forced to shelve the ridesharing offerings that have helped make it the world\u2019s second most-valuable startup for its Irish operations.\nHere it effectively operates as a taxi- and hire-car booking service only, absent its more-controversial features of being able to also book private cars which were not officially licensed as taxis.\nThose budget options have helped Uber broker over one million rides worldwide per day, although it has also led to city bans and protests from taxi drivers complaining the startup puts them out of business.\nThere have also been safety concerns raised about putting passengers into cars with drivers who haven\u2019t gone through the same vetting processes as professionals, although the companies involved have been careful to try and put those fears to bed.\nIn Ireland, companies found to be running illegal taxi services can be fined \u20ac50,000 while individual drivers can also be sanctioned under 2013 laws which ban people taking paying"}

But it was bad enough: petty, vindictive, and self-destructive. It was, as the saying goes, worse than a crime. It was a blunder.\nIn its arrogant insularity, the Wisconsin GOP became a national symbol of win-at-all-costs, norms-be-damned politics. Cut through the overwrought rhetoric and what did the Republican legislators actually accomplish? Not really a whole lot; certainly not enough to justify the political damage they\u2019ve inflicted on themselves. They have managed to energize the progressive base, expose themselves as sore losers, and undermine crucial democratic norms. And in return \u2026 they got extraordinarily little.\nMeeting through the night, legislators voted to restrict early voting, an unsubtle response to the massive turnout in the Democratic strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee Counties that helped Democrats sweep the statewide ballot on November 6. But the attack on early voting will likely be struck down by the courts. Indeed, their similar effort in 2016 was ruled unconstitutional.\nRead: Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin aim to hobble incoming Democrats.\nThey also blocked incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit against Obamacare. But whether Wisconsin is listed on the suit will have no effect at all on the pending litigation, which could threaten guaranteed coverage of preexisting conditions. The GOP then proceeded to dig itself a deeper hole by defeating legislation designed to provide some protection for people with preexisting conditions\u2014should the lawsuit succeed\u2014despite outgoing Republican Governor Scott Walker\u2019s repeated promises to enact such a measure.\nThat issue contributed mightily to the party\u2019s losses in November, and the legislature\u2019s action ensures that health care will remain a liability for the GOP going into 2020.\nMore substantively, GOP legislators limited the new governor\u2019s ability to seek waivers from federal programs and codified Walker\u2019s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. They also sharply limited the role of the newly elected Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, by giving the legislature control over lawsuits involving the state and by giving legislators the authority to hire private attorneys to defend state laws.\nThe rest? A grab bag of legislative fixes, bureaucratic rules, and power shifts, some good, some odd, but all mostly small bore.\nRepublicans can also argue that they were merely affirming the powers of a co-equal branch of government (something their counterparts in Washington might wish to emulate.) Their case, however, is weakened by their lack of concern for excessive executive powers prior to the November 6 election. In any case, they have big majorities in both legislative chambers and will be able to provide a powerful check on the incoming governor after he is sworn in, even without the last-minute legislation. In other words, the lame-duck bill only marginally increases their preexisting legislative clout.\nPerhaps aware of the de minimis nature of some of the measures, they have been quick to accuse their critics of hysterical overreaction. \u201cYou are so grossly exaggerating the words of this bill, it makes me sick,\u201d complained one of the architects of the legislation, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos.

They\u2019ll play one more exhibition contest Saturday in Finland, this one against the Swiss team, before the official start of group play Thursday.\nHughes met the team in Heinola, Finland, after making an appearance at the draft lottery in Toronto on Tuesday night.

All games are televised on NHL Network.\nAll eyes will be on Hughes. Kaapo Kakko, the Finnish phenom who is projected to go No. 2 right now, will not be playing in the event. The 18-year-old winger who plays in Finland\u2019s highest league, Liiga, will be playing in the senior event in May. Kakko will be playing against NHL players and some of the top international talent.\nThis is a big tournament for Hughes. He was injured during the World Junior Championship a few months ago and didn\u2019t get to show what he\u2019s fully capable of. But Hughes has been well-scouted. His excellent skating and his ability to create offense out of nowhere has earned him the reputation of a magician on the ice.\nHughes\u2019 best asset may be his ability to make others around him better on the ice. His linemate with the US National Team Development Program, Cole Caulfield, has more goals (29) than Hughes (12) in the USHL this season. Caulfield himself has become a projected first-round pick despite his stature (5-foot-6, 150 pounds).\nGeneral manager Ray Shero has already said he will be traveling to Sweden for the event in order to scout Hughes. New Jersey\u2019s director of amateur scouting, Paul Castron, has seen Hughes several times and has been singing his praises for a year now, since the team brought in his brother Quinn, a Vancouver Canucks rookie, for pre-draft interviews last year.\nBy now you probably know the story of the Hughes family: Their father, Jim, played at Providence College and briefly in Europe, while Shero represented him as his agent.

{"idx": "20094", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It takes an outsider to see Manhattan that way. And it's an outsider, Sir Terence Conran, who made good on the theatrical possibilities in the tiled vaults under the bridge. Once the site of a thriving food market, they have been a dead spot since the 1930's, used by the city for a sign-painting shop and later a storage depot.\nSir Terence's dazzling transformation of the bridge vaults gives New Yorkers their first glimpse of a swaggering new international restaurant style. It's a style whose energy and informality feels American, but that has achieved its most complete expression in London and Paris, transforming the restaurant scenes there. Restaurants like Oxo Tower and Bank in London, and Buddha Bar and Bon in Paris, manage to combine the elements of a bar, nightclub, restaurant and theater. They are places to pose, to see and be seen. The bar can often overshadow the dining room.\nSir Terence has led the way, seizing on unlikely architectural sites for much-imitated restaurants like Le Pont de la Tour in London and Alcazar in Paris. Designed to the hilt, they tend to be large, bordering on enormous. They are loud, lively and up to the minute. Although sensitive to the architectural details of their sites, they ignore, or transcend, the cultural specifics of the cities they happen to be in. The food often runs second to the design.\nGuastavino's fits the pattern. Named after the father and son team who created the tiled ceilings in the bridge's vaults (as well as the ceilings in the Grand Central Oyster Bar and the abandoned City Hall subway station), the restaurant encourages the eye to linger on the powerful pillars that lead upward to cathedral-like ceilings. The raw, almost brutal granite blocks that make up the caissons of the bridge have been left exposed. Sir Terence has extracted every ounce of drama from his location.\nBut the overall design is as sleek and international as the Concorde. A long, low-slung bar on the main level pulls a large Upper East Side crowd -- so large that on Thursdays the restaurant sets up a barrier and allows no one in who does not have a dinner reservation. Guastavino Restaurant, on the first floor, is a 300-seat brasserie, clamorous and casual, with a glorious brasserie-style shellfish display in front of the kitchen.\nUp a curved marble staircase, the more formal and intimate Club Guastavino, which seats 100, hangs over the first floor like a giant balcony, soaking up noise and energy from below, but retaining a swaddled sense of isolation and privilege, enhanced by more luxurious materials and boothlike velvet-upholstered sofas.\nThe one discordant note in the design is a rather commercial-looking sculpture, 36 feet tall, hanging against the stone wall near the bar. Made of laminated birch sliced into ribbons, it resembles a giant tangle of box tape.\nGuastavino's two kitchens, which operate independently, are under the direction of Daniel Orr, formerly of La Grenouille. Mr. Orr is feeding a lot of people out there, and considering the number of diners swarming into the two restaurants, he does a more than respectable job.\nThe food may not light up the night, but at his best, he sends out well-conceived, well-executed dishes that really can compete with the surroundings"}

He said the constitutional reform should be followed by the election of a new Armenian parliament that would form a government which would in turn hold a \u201cfree, fair and transparent\u201d presidential ballot.\nThe authorities are unlikely to accept Geghamian\u2019s conditions, however. Speaking in the National Assembly earlier in the day, deputy parliament speaker Tigran Torosian assured fellow pro-government lawmakers that the constitutional amendments, if they are approved by voters, will not entail fresh elections. He said the authorities would need time to organize legislative and presidential elections meeting \u201call international standards\u201d in 2007 and 2008 respectively.\nTorosian also effectively rejected conditions set by the Artarutyun bloc, the other opposition force represented in the parliament. Artarutyun demands that the ruling regime give more powers to the National Assembly, make Armenian courts less dependent on the president and guarantee direct elections of Yerevan\u2019s future mayors.

Their anticipated rejection of the proposed amendments would seriously complicate Kocharian\u2019s efforts to win sufficient voter support for the reform.\nKocharian signaled on Wednesday that he will go to great lengths to enact the amendments which the Council of Europe says are necessary for Armenia\u2019s democratization and European integration. Still, his chief constitutional lawyer, Armen Harutiunian, said on Friday that the authorities will not seek to secure a \u201cyes\u201d vote at any cost.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a catastrophe if this constitution is not adopted,\u201d Harutiunian told representatives of two dozen governmental organizations supportive of the Armenian leader. He said the failure of the effort would hurt the entire country, rather than its leadership."}

But the issue, over the last few weeks, of Greece\u2019s confrontation with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as that country has been searching for funds to keep its economy afloat, will have a ring of familiarity to citizens of Caricom, and would induce an interest in affairs so far away, that would, on the face of it, have seemed unmerited.\nBut the picture of a relatively new political party finding itself in the seat of power with extremely difficult economic circumstances confronting it, will not be unfamiliar to the people of our region. To take one case, for example, Jamaica in the north still struggles to maintain what might seem to some an extremely long period (since the mid-1970s) implementing an economic recovery programme with the IMF. And, it might be recalled, the institution was widely thought then, to be acting substantially as an agent of the Western powers, the use of whose resources it negotiates with countries in desperate economic circumstances.\nAnd nearer to the present in the Caribbean, many will have been observing the present struggle of the Government of Barbados to implement an IMF programme, though without the public and highly political resistance demonstrated in Jamaica in earlier times.\nThe curious interest that we, in this part of the world have, will obviously be elicited by the moving picture of resistance which the new government of the Syriza party of Greece has been trying to put up as the IMF, with the strong support of the EU, insists that there can be no other way for Greece to proceed but to implement a certain number of familiar measures. These are seen, in the halls of European governments, as the price not only for Greece\u2019s economic recovery, but for adhering to what is accepted in the EU itself as a set of necessary measures to be undertaken. And this is so regardless of the government\u2019s asserted legitimacy as having been recently elected almost specifically with a mandate to find an alternative, or certainly a less financially challenging, path.\nThe news this week appears to be that, in spite of the apparently quite differing views of Greece from the other two parties \u2212 the IMF and the EU \u2013 a desperate effort is now seeming to be made, within the limits of each party\u2019s mandate, to arrive at a solution to the problem. This scenario would appear to have been precipitated by the parties\u2019 growing realization that no single one will allow its back to be driven against the wall. And for Greece in particular, with such an apparently unceasing prolongation of its confrontation with the other powers staring the government in the face, it would mean the possibility of a return to the polls.\nFor the EU, a prolongation would perhaps mean a worsening of the ferocity of the Greek government\u2019s supporters at home, in the face of a lack of potential negotiators from alternative parties-governments, whose failure to come to grips with the present situation has been, in large measure, the reason for the presence of the Syriza party in office. But in addition, there seems to be some sense within the EU, that without an agreement with the present government, little prospect of an alternative with a sufficient amount of support within the country, could produce the result that the EU would want.\nBut in addition, the Syriza government, essentially from parties of the left, has, just as the EU and IMF were apparently beginning to feel that Prime Minister Tsipras and Minister of Finance Varoufakis, the obviously key figures in the government, were beginning to feel the pressure which those institutions were exerting against them"}

{"idx": "20100", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Left's big gamble to distract from ObamaCare.\nAs George Orwell envisioned in \"1984,\" statists need an enemy to distract people from the failures of their corrosive ideology. In that seminal novel, the enemy was Emmanuel Goldstein, and a period of \"Two Minutes Hate\" was staged by the ruling party to keep the public sufficiently distracted. Democrats and their media allies, well aware they too must keep the public distracted from their failed policies heading into the 2014 elections, have created two Emmanuel Goldsteins of their very own: billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\nA screed published Monday by the New York Times editorial board sets the tone. \"Democrats have for too long been passive in the face of the vast amounts of corporate money, most of it secret, that are being spent to evict them from office and dismantle their policies,\" the paper breathlessly states. \"By far the largest voice in many of this year\u2019s political races, for example, has been that of the Koch brothers, who have spent tens of millions of dollars peddling phony stories about the impact of health care reform, all in order to put Republicans in control of the Senate after the November elections.\"\nAs the Times reveals, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is leading the charge, noting that in a recent speech, Reid \"pointed out that the fundamental purpose of the Kochs\u2019 spending is to rig the economic system for their benefit and for that of other oligarchs.\" The insinuation is obvious: it is the \"evil rich\" Koch brothers and their small cabal of equally evil and powerful allies against the rest of us. The paper further notes that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) has set up a website, www.kochaddiction.com, dedicated solely to promoting that proposition, and \"to remind voters of just what the Kochs stand for, and why they raised $407 million in the 2012 election.\"\nAfter reading all that, one might be tempted to conclude that the Koch brothers are among the heaviest hitters in American politics. This, of course, is false. As the website OpenSecrets.org reveals, among the top all-time donors from the years 1989-2014, the Koch brothers come in at -- wait for it -- number 59. The same website further reveals that 6 of the top 10 political donors are unions, who overwhelmingly favor Democrats with their campaign contributions by margins of 91 precent or greater, compared to what they give Republicans.\nUnfortunately for Democrats, the light has indeed come on for many Americans, but the illumination is shining on the disaster of ObamaCare, which has become toxic for Democrats -- and they know it. Hence the hysteria, once again evinced by Harry Reid, who is determined to convince Americans that the Koch brothers are liars -- less than a month after he labeled every American with a \"horror story\" about ObamaCare as being equally mendacious. That would be the same Harry Reid who lied unabashedly about Mitt Romney not paying any income taxes for ten years.\nAn editorial in yesterday's New York Post reveals how despicable Reid's characterization truly is. It noted that David Koch has donated a whopping $100 million to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital to help them construct a state-of-the-art ambulatory center.

I know they're a young team, but our boys just stepped it up and managed to win,\" said North Star coach Stacy Schmitt, whose team improved to 3-2.\n\"We knew coming into this game that it was huge for us as far as future possible playoff implications. Like I said, the kids just stepped it up tonight.\"\nWith the ground game working, the Cougars looked to John Hornick to carry the load for the offense, and the senior tailback delivered big time. Hornick finished with 167 yards rushing on 27 carries.\nSenior Brandon Delano added 85 yards rushing, with 64 coming on one long touchdown run.\nSchmitt had nothing but praise for his two running backs, but he was also quick to credit his offensive line, which is comprised of Josh Daly, Andy Nicklow, Karl Hoffman, Matt Lepley and Ryan Wilson.\n\"Hornick and Delano did a great job,\" Schmitt said. \"The line was opening up some nice holes and our fullbacks were doing some blocking also.\"\nChad Kaltenbaugh posted 11 tackles from his inside linebacker position to lead the Cougars' defense. Richard Durstine made six stops while Ryan Beahr had five tackles and an interception.\nLinebacker Tyler Anderson made two interceptions to lead the Red Raiders on defense.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Delano put North Star on the board at the 6:55 mark of the second period when he took a handoff, broke a tackle at the line of scrimmage and raced 64 yards up the middle for the touchdown.\nThe Cougars lined up to kick the extra-point, but the snap was high, so holder Zack Pritts scrambled to his right and found Hornick open in the end zone for the two-point conversion.\nDown 8-0 without much offensive production in the first half, the Red Raiders knew they needed to make something happen in the second half, and Drew Wiltrout took it upon himself to do just that.\nWiltrout fielded the opening kickoff near the 15-yard line, made several North Star defenders miss and raced 85 yards through the middle of the field for a thrilling touchdown.\nThe two-point conversion try failed, but the Red Raiders cut the Cougars' lead to 8-6 with just seconds gone in the third quarter.\nNorth Star answered right back, however, and put together a 14-play drive capped off by Pritts' 7-yard TD run.\n\"That was huge,\" Schmitt said. \"When (Wiltrout) got that run back on us, that could have really set us back.

{"idx": "20117", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In his novel, \"The Floating Opera,\" John Barth creates the image of a play performed on a barge carried up and down a river by the tide, the spectators lining the shore. All we know for sure, Barth writes, is what we see when the play is in front of us. The rest we piece together by rumor and word-of-mouth from what others see. Such is the case with the health of Tiger Woods. Pretty much all we know is what we see when we see him. Other than that, we just don't know.\nSo the severity of Woods' latest injury, tightness in his left Achilles tendon that forced him to withdraw from the Cadillac Championship with seven holes to play, may not be understood until next week's Arnold Palmer Invitational. If Tiger doesn't show up at Bay Hill, where he is already committed to play, the roller coaster ride of injuries that have plagued him for nearly five years could be on another downward slide.\nThe problem here is that getting information from the Woods camp about his physical condition is a little like asking Iran for details about its nuclear weapons program: Don't expect answers, at least not in a timely fashion. In December 2008, for example, Woods ruptured his right Achilles tendon while rehabbing from knee surgery. We were informed of that rather significant detail at the 2010 Masters.\nAnd last year, when he returned in August from a nearly three-month hiatus after reinjuring his left knee and Achilles at the Masters, Woods was on a strict ball count, which greatly limited his practice time. That detail was revealed in December at the Chevron World Challenge.\nYou always get the feeling that whatever is going on is not exactly what you are being told. Perhaps Woods is hurt worse than we have been told now. Or maybe he just lost interest Sunday after a 38 on the front nine and then a water ball on No. 10. Or maybe he just doesn't want to play at the Bay Hill event, which is run by IMG, to get back at his former agency. We just don't know.\nThis is what we do know: Since he winced and grimaced his way to victory over Rocco Mediate in a five-day, 91-hole marathon at the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, Woods has quit tournaments three times, citing injuries. This time, his departure came when it appeared he was as close to a reasonable facsimile of his once great game as he has been since his car ended up on a fire hydrant in the wee hours of Nov. 27, 2009.\nThe medical part of the Woods opera began December 1994, when he had surgery to remove two benign tumors and scar tissue in his left knee. The same month in 2002, Tiger had surgery to remove fluid around his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The really bad stuff started to happen in July 2007, when Woods ruptured the ACL in his left knee while running. He played on and won five of his last six tournaments, including the PGA Championship.\nTwo days after finishing second in the 2008 Masters, Woods had arthroscopic surgery to fix cartilage damage in his left knee. Then eight days after winning that 2008 U.S. Open, Woods had surgery on the ACL of his left knee and admitted that he was advised not to play at Torrey Pines because he had two stress fractures in his left tibia"}

So far, according to my host, this man's penitence has helped almost 70 people escape the clutches of these jihadists, whose brutality is matched only by ISIS.\nThese men are among the most recent Al-Shabaab defectors to join Somalia's fledgling rehabilitation program, the Socioeconomic Reintegration of Ex-Combatants and Youth at Risk. It is an ambitious effort to signal to Al-Shabaab fighters that they have a chance to walk away from terrorism.\nEarly indicators suggest the program is succeeding in attracting disillusioned fighters away from East Africa's al Qaeda affiliate. Without significant investment, however, this tiny program, and others like it, cannot fully realize the astonishing potential to thin the ranks of terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab.\nIftiin Foundation, a small nongovernmental organization based in Somalia that invited me to the country, was one of several groups implementing the program until the Somali government recently decided to manage all efforts. The focus of the program continues to be to win back the hearts and minds of those once thought lost to jihadists and hellbent on unraveling Somalia's social, cultural and political fabric.\nFor 10 years, I've studied terrorist deradicalization initiatives around the world. I've visited programs in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Singapore and elsewhere. It's difficult to say if, and how, such programs work. They are often shrouded in secrecy and rarely subject to any kind of independent evaluation.\nMost programs point to low recidivism rates as a benchmark of success. If only a tiny few go back into the arms of the group, then a program may say it is successful. This makes sense -- except for two critical issues. What little research on terrorist recidivism exists suggests that compared with ordinary crime, the recidivism rate for terrorist offenders is often low, even for people who do not participate in programs.\nAdditionally, in Somalia, defection from Al-Shabaab is a one-way street. The defectors tell a common story: \"They will slaughter anyone who goes back.\" In other words, defectors fully expect to be killed by Al-Shabaab if and when they do dare to leave the group.\nThe challenge for programs such as Iftiin's is to be able to evaluate success without pointing to a low"}

Stewart. \u201cIt has that melodic dimension, streetwise poetic lyrics, and even the beat was very similar to some of Gil\u2019s productions.\u201d The single went gold in 21 days, was universally praised, and is the first hip-hop recording to be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In the months that followed, other hip-hop artists started to release songs with lyrics about real life. Rappers told the Furious Five that they all had written their own \u201cmessage\u201d songs but were concerned about the songs\u2019 commercial potential\u2014until they became hits. Scott-Heron\u2019s influence is all over \u201cThe Message,\u201d which paved the way for socially conscious hip-hop artists ranging from KRS-One and Rakim to Public Enemy and Mos Def.\nBut when Scott-Heron\u2019s album Moving Target was released in September 1982, it landed with a thud. The album sounded anachronistic in a music landscape that had been fully transformed by hip-hop and the dominance of electronic instruments, and it hardly made a dent on the charts. The tour was one of the most extensive ever taken by Scott-Heron, with concerts in the United States, England, Australia, and Germany. But something was happening to his fan base: though he played to packed houses across the ocean and basked in the praise of his European fans, he could get gigs only in smaller venues back home, and the critics were . . . well, critical. In November, he and the band performed at the Bottom Line in New York. When he made his electrifying debut at the club in 1974, Scott-Heron\u2019s fiery energy had been applauded by Stevie Wonder and Clive Davis. Much had changed over the last eight years.\nLittle did Maslin, the readers of The New York Times,"}

He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 1 a.m. on March 9, 1997.\nThe fatal round entered his right hip and ripped through his liver, lung and heart.\nDespite numerous investigations by the Los Angeles Police Department, lawsuits, books and a plethora of allegations, the 20-year-old slaying of the performer whose real name was Christopher Wallace remains officially unsolved.\nWallace's slaying came just six months after rap rival Tupac Shakur was gunned down in Las Vegas. The two killings would become forever intertwined as observers theorized that the violence was fueled by an East Coast-West Coast rivalry.\nShakur's death also remains unsolved.\nIn Wallace's case, many of those who investigated the killing say the likely culprits are long-gone gangsters. Exactly who they were and what motivated them remains a mystery.\n\"The shooter is most likely dead. You cannot ask him who paid him,\" said Kevin McClure, a former LAPD captain who oversaw the investigation and is now the Montebello police chief. \"We don't know who gave the money.\"\nMcClure shut down a task force on the killing in 2010 because it was spinning its wheels. \"We kept pounding the doors on the same cold leads,\" he said.\nLike many cold cases, however, someone may come forward in the future with answers, McClure said.\nAs with many of L.A.'s legendary unsolved cases, it is assigned to a member of the LAPD's elite Robbery-Homicide Division. Det. Daryn Dupree currently has the Wallace investigation. Dupree also worked on the Grim Sleeper serial killer case.\n\"It is an open case. We are still actively investigating, and we constantly discuss the disposition of the case with the district attorney's office,\" said Capt. William Hayes, who heads the division.\nThe slaying has spawned a cottage industry of books, documentaries and magazine articles exploring possible conspiracy theories. A couple of movies are also in the works.\nAmong the theories pushed by one now-deceased LAPD detective was that dirty cops connected to the Rampart corruption scandal were involved in the slaying.\nIn 2006, then-LAPD Chief William J. Bratton, who was fed up with speculation over the killing, launched the task force of senior homicide detectives in an effort to hunt down the killer.\nThe probe followed a wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the city by the rapper's mother, Voletta Wallace, and other relatives.\nIn court documents, the family alleged that ex-LAPD Officer David A. Mack conspired with rap impresario Marion \"Suge\" Knight, then the owner of Death Row Records, to have Wallace ambushed. The family contended in the suit that Mack arranged for a college friend to carry out the attack. Mack, the college friend and Knight have all denied any involvement.

Up until last year, the Pentagon could only deploy drones to help state or federal civilian authorities with the direct approval of the Secretary of Defense. In August, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a memo enabling other military leaders, and in some cases governors, to authorize the use of drones.\nAs Gettinger points out, other US agencies outside of the Pentagon are using drones domestically -- specifically, he notes, the Department of Homeland Security routinely uses drones to patrol US borders."}

{"idx": "20134", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The concept of cleaning out a division is something that&apos;s been discussed with several great champions during the course of UFC history.\nDuring Anderson Silva&apos;s reign of terror over the middleweight division, he supposedly wiped out every viable contender several times over to the point where he was taking fights at 205 pounds just to have someone new to fight.\nFormer welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre had a similar run during his career. Although, his division boasted a much deeper talent pool that still couldn&apos;t find a way to dethrone him outside of possibly the greatest upset of all time that the Canadian legend later rectified.\nIn current era of the UFC, there are two fighters who are in the same category as Silva and St-Pierre in regards to dominating a division so thoroughly it makes everyone else seem pedestrian despite the list of contenders actually being quite good.\nRonda Rousey has systematically laid waste to everybody in the UFC women&apos;s bantamweight division to the point where she&apos;s facing someone like Bethe Correia, who didn&apos;t even bother to beat a top-10 opponent before getting a title shot. Her upcoming opponent, Holly Holm, who is 2-0 in the UFC, will walk into her championship bout somewhere around a 15-to-1 underdog.\nThen there&apos;s Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson, who once again throttled a top contender on Saturday night as he outstruck, outwrestled and outworked John Dodson for five rounds at UFC 191 en route to his seventh straight title defense.\nDodson has mangled the competition at flyweight since moving down a division after being a title contender at bantamweight while being a much smaller fighter in pretty much every bout he took at 135 pounds.\nHe went to a split decision with Joseph Benavidez to win the belt and then proceeded to knock him out cold in the first round of their rematch. Johnson made short work of John Moraga, Ali Bagautinov, Chris Cariaso and Kyoji Horiguchi without even really breaking a sweat. Dodson gave Johnson possibly his toughest fight at 125 pounds in their first affair and then he proceeded to get shut out in the rematch.\nWhile Dodson clearly deserved another shot at Johnson, the fact that \"Mighty Mouse\" already had to face fighters ranked somewhere in the neighborhood of seven or eight in his division should have been proof he was already on his way to clearing out anybody and everybody that posed a potential threat to him more than a year ago.\nOther contenders like Ian McCall and John Lineker sabotage themselves before they even get a chance to challenge Johnson in the Octagon.\nThe only choice likely left in the division is Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo if he can get past Jussier Formiga at UFC Fight Night in Monterrey, Mexico on Nov. 21. Cejudo certainly has the athletic resume to promote a fight against Johnson considering he&apos;s one of only a handful of Olympic gold medalists to ever compete in the UFC, but at 9-0 overall with three decision wins in the Octagon, is he really the only answer to the question who is left for Demetrious Johnson?\nIf Cejudo wins in November he seems like the most likely candidate to get the next shot, but realistically as gifted as he may be, he&apos;s just not ready for someone like Johnson at this stage of his career.

But it wasn\u2019t Newton blue and white. It was Kentucky.\nBelcher, a former kicker for the Rams\u2019 football program, made no secret about where he was going for college. He proudly displayed the UK Wildcat colors, as he informed students, teachers, faculty, friends and family in Newton\u2019s packed auditorium where he was headed after his high school graduation.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: Talk to Belcher, and you\u2019ll discover that his pride for his future school has absolutely nothing to do with football.\nGoing this route give Belcher the opportunity to fulfill at least one half of his lifelong college dream. Belcher said since he was little he\u2019d always envisioned himself playing football at Kentucky. But a shoulder injury he sustained in practice a couple of years ago halted that.\nThe injury required him to have surgery which sat him out for the rest of his football career, primarily because he realized that if he had to have any other surgeries or sustained any other injuries, he\u2019d probably not be able to do thing he wanted to do maybe even more than football \u2014 join the military.\nBelcher admits that he was kind of bummed about it at first.\nFor him, now, that means positioning himself to serve his country.

Montana Power sold its Billings and Colstrip coal-fired power plants and the hydroelectric dams to PPL Corp. NorthWestern bought Montana Power\u2019s transmission and distribution system in 2002 and MPC, by then known as Touch America Holdings Inc., folded the next year.\nBob Rowe, CEO of Sioux Falls, S.D.-based NorthWestern \u2014 and a member of the Montana Public Service Commission from 1993 to 2004 \u2014 said in an interview last week that deregulation was a mistake.\n\u201cOur rates have had fairly remarkable stability. \u2026 It\u2019s hard to know what prices would have been if deregulation had not occurred but would we have been better off? Yes,\u201d he said.\nIf NorthWestern ends up owning the dams, Rowe said, \u201cFor light load hours we\u2019re in great shape\u201d in ability to deliver power to customers without purchasing more. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if these facilities were built for this system. Imagine that,\u201d he said, referring with irony to Montana Power\u2019s original formation surrounding construction and ownership of the dams.\nWhile NorthWestern\u2019s purchase of the dams \u2014 if approved by the PSC \u2014 will increase electric bills slightly for the utility\u2019s Montana customers, Rowe said in the long run it will provide price stability by eliminating the \u201cmiddleman\u201d from the source of the hydropower and removing some of the price fluctuation that accompanies power generated by commodities such as coal and natural gas.\nThe Tribune posed these questions to Rowe and other officials concerning the debt purchase. Here are their answers.\n1. How will purchase of the dams affect rates for your customers?\nRowe: Montana customers will see 4.22 percent increase in their electric bill. That comes to $3.53 a month, based on this transaction. This is based on cost of financing, plus people costs and taxes, which can change. Nine percent to 10 percent of a (Montana customer\u2019s) bill is taxes. Investments in other infrastructure to serve Montana can also have an effect. We\u2019ve managed to invest in the long-term quality of service and keep rates I think pretty remarkably stable during that time \u2014 and declining on the gas side. The best comparison is going from renting a home to taking out a mortgage and buying a home.

This means that the car is technically the driver instead of any human occupant in it, according to Google.\nMany major technology companies and traditional auto manufacturers are working on driverless cars and it is expected they\u2019ll be commercially available within four years. One of the major complaints and hindrances for autonomous car companies like Google, however, is trying to navigate the sometimes vague state and federal safety rules covering self-driving vehicles.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s ruling will go a long way to alleviating the legality of what is driving a self-driving car on the road. However, there are still many legal and regulatory issues to be clarified and resolved. For example, who is responsible if a self-driving car gets into an accident? The human occupant? The manufacturer? The developer who coded the software? It is still unclear where the liability would rest. Also, human drivers need to pass driving tests in order to be licensed to drive. How do you license an individual car to drive? Would each car need to be road-tested at a local DMV after the owner bought it? Or could a driver license be issued to a fleet of self-driving cars as they roll off the assembly lines?\n\u201cThe next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver,\u201d the NHTSA wrote.\nFor its part Google said it is \u201cstill evaluating\u201d NHTSA\u2019s lengthy response, reports Reuters.\nWill AI Destroy Or Delight Us?"}

{"idx": "20145", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: It was only in July of this year that Fab.com laid off 150 people in Europe and parted ways with its \u201cChief European Officer,\u201d but today comes news that the design commerce site is ramping up once again in the region with an acquisition. Fab.com has acquired assets from myFab, a home decor and designer furniture portal in France, to build out its European business into that country.\nThe story was first reported by the French-language Journal du Net, which pegs the deal at \u20ac3.1 million ($4.3 million), with possible additional payouts over time. I\u2019ve reached out to Fab for confirmation and a company spokesperson confirms that \u201cwe have not bought the whole company, we just acquired certain assets.\u201d We\u2019re looking into what assets those might be and will update this post with more information as we learn it.\nPrior to the acquisition, myFab was 51% owned by a WebMediaGroup, which owns other design commerce sites like Maison Facile, Tek Import and Amateur de Design, and 49% by Alven Capital and BV Capital. MyFab was originally co-founded by Ning Li, who later left and co-founded Made.com in the UK. The company had raised some $10.2 million in funding. It\u2019s not clear what assets have been acquired by Fab.com, but $4.3 million doesn\u2019t sound like a lucrative exit for the company.\nMyFab\u2019s business model was built on the idea that site visitors can get access to inventory direct from factories and warehouses. By cutting out middlemen, myFab promised discounts of 70% on the same goods offered by other e-commerce sites or physical retailers. Part of the process, it seems, involves enough customers ordering goods to trigger the factory to make the pieces \u2014 although JdN writes that in fact this model proved to be a disaster, with unfulfilled orders and unhappy customers. It\u2019s not clear yet if Fab.com is buying this aspect of the business, or simply the name. Right now the site is down for reconstruction, a note on its homepage says.\nFab.com, meanwhile, has been pivoting over the last several months away from its earlier flash sales model and towards a more straightforward design-focused e-commerce site \u2014 this was, it seems, partly the rationale for the European layoffs from earlier this year. But at the same time, Fab.com already has a significant business in Europe, with some 40% of those sales in the UK, and with dedicated sites for the UK and Germany. The company is also building a warehouse and logistics operation in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, so there is likely plans for more growth.\nIn that context, expanding into France, one of the biggest markets in the region, is an essential step. JdN notes that Fab.com has long been eyeing up a move into the country but was prevented from doing so because of myFab and the brand confusion this may have caused.\nCoincidentally, Fab.com\u2019s legal nemisis, the fashion commerce site JustFab \u2014 the two are are locked in lawsuits over trademark infringement \u2014 has also gone the Fab route to expand in Europe. It acquired a site in France earlier this year, Fab Shoes, to expand into both France and Spain.\nFab has raised some $336 million to date and has ambitions also to extend to Asia in partnership with strategic investments from the likes of Tencent. At its last big round of $150 million, it was valued at $1 billion."}

{"idx": "20150", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Is Incentive Compensation a True Motivator?\nI write about compensation governance.\n\u201cPay for performance\u201d \u2013 the concept that executives\u2019 compensation should be commensurate with the value they deliver to shareholders \u2013 has become a household phrase in recent years. The popular understanding of its meaning reflects the longstanding belief in corporate America that financial incentives are the most powerful motivator of executive performance.\nYet the findings of various studies by behavioral psychologists suggest otherwise. These findings have profound implications for companies large and small, for they raise questions about the motivational rationale underlying incentive compensation programs.\nIn the 1950s, researcher Harry Harlow observed the behavior of monkeys performing relatively complex tasks. Based on these observations, Harlow postulated that the very performance of these tasks was its own reward \u2013 that the monkeys were driven by \u201cintrinsic motivation.\u201d Unfortunately, Harlow did not pursue his remarkable discovery any further \u2013 perhaps because it was too threatening to 1950s beliefs about motivating people with \u201cextrinsic\u201d rewards, otherwise known as money. Starting then and continuing to the present, corporate America has institutionalized a system of incentive compensation supported not by behavioral studies, but by finance research. Extrinsic financial rewards to executives have increased at escalating rates, far surpassing the growth in a typical worker\u2019s pay.\nNearly half a century after Harlow, psychological researchers comprehensively analyzed the results of 128 laboratory studies into the relationships between incentives, motivation and performance. Their findings concerning intrinsic motivation not only confirmed Harlow\u2019s, but also showed that incentive-based (extrinsic) rewards can have the net effect of actually lowering performance.\nSubsequent research over the past decade, most of it conducted in laboratory settings, also has found that incentives can limit or impair performance, particularly in situations requiring creativity and innovation. Summarizing the thrust of these findings in Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (Riverhead Books, 2009), author Daniel Pink outlines the potential unintended consequences of using monetary incentives: extinguishing intrinsic motivation, diminishing performance, crushing creativity, encouraging unethical behavior and fostering short-term thinking.\nBehavioral researchers have found that external incentives can work against the inherent motivator of autonomy, our basic need to feel that we are in charge of our own destiny. Autonomy, relatedness (connection with others) and competence (a sense of mastery, accomplishment and achievement) are the core human needs and key intrinsic motivators at the heart of what is known as self-determination theory (SDT).\nIf the intrinsic motivators comprised by SDT are indeed critical to performance, one might ask, why haven\u2019t they figured more prominently in corporate compensation programs? Why have companies instead put so much emphasis on extrinsic rewards? In formulating compensation programs, companies have relied not on psychological studies, but on research from the fields of accounting and finance. This research has been grounded in agency theory, which seeks to solve what is known as the agency problem: that company owners and agents who work for them (management), don\u2019t have the same economic interests, so the solution is to use incentives to align management\u2019s interests with those of shareholders. SDT implicitly challenges the rationale of basing incentive compensation plans largely or wholly on agency theory.\nOf course, just because incentive compensation may be addictive doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily ineffective at boosting performance in some circumstances; it might people to do things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise want to do because they lack intrinsic motivation"}

The conservatory, which has basked in the glow of association with the movement, has declined to provide funds for an expansion that Sistema backers say is crucial and inevitable.\n\u201cWe really felt this was outside our mission altogether,\u201d the conservatory\u2019s president, Tony Woodcock, said in an interview last week. He forcefully praised the movement\u2019s goals and said that the substantive work of El Sistema U.S.A. \u2014 a program in which 10 fellows a year are trained to go off and establish or run music education programs \u2014 would go on at the conservatory. The institution has promised to finance the program, now in its second season, for five years. Mr. Woodcock left open the possibility that the fellowship would end after that. He said his decision to sever ties with El Sistema was made with leaders of the conservatory\u2019s board.\nShe said that even if the fellows program at New England Conservatory \u2014 where she is a member of the board of overseers \u2014 were to stop after five years, ending up with 50 evangelizers, or one for each state, would be a major achievement.\n\u201cN.E.C. planted the big seed,\u201d she said, referring to the conservatory.\nIn Venezuela, El Sistema has drawn some 400,000 young people, most of them poor, into a constellation of orchestras and musical training centers. Intensive lessons, rehearsals and classes throughout the week are intended to keep children of troubled neighborhoods off the streets, instill a feeling of self-worth and purpose and create a sense of community.\nIt has also produced stars, most notably the charismatic music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Gustavo Dudamel, whose first conducting engagement outside Venezuela came in 2002 at the New England Conservatory, with a youth orchestra. Other promising conductors are in the pipeline.\nIn this country El Sistema has captivated the imaginations of musicians, music teachers, orchestra administrators, donors and filmmakers and the producers of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Many feel that the movement has made classical music suddenly seem relevant, and powerfully useful, to society. While major institutions like Carnegie Hall and large orchestras have long worked to bring music to neighborhoods, El Sistema has invigorated those who see a larger value in music education, which suffers in many impoverished school systems.\nSupporters have nurtured three dozen music education programs inspired by El Sistema around the United States, most teaching 50 to 150 students, said Dalouge Smith, the president and chief executive officer of the San Diego Youth Symphony and Conservatory, who has been active in bringing the new programs together. In efforts sponsored by the youth orchestra, elementary school children meet twice a week in ensembles after school for 90-minute sessions and have lessons on Saturdays.\nSimilar programs have sprouted in the past three years, often under the auspices of major orchestras like the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Baltimore Symphony; youth orchestras; community music schools; magnet"}

The merger would reduce the number of major carriers from four to three. That, consumer advocates say, would lead to higher costs, especially since both T-Mobile and Sprint tend to serve lower-income customers than AT&T and Verizon.\nAccording to The Journal, Justice Department staff met with representatives of both companies in early April and expressed their concerns about the deal. They also reportedly challenged the companies\u2019 arguments that the merger would make both entities stronger and lower costs.\nSprint and T-Mobile have steadfastly maintained that the merger is important to their ability to compete with their larger rivals when it comes to deploying a 5G network, which is more expensive than current 4G network technology.\nIn a blog post last month, T-Mobile CEO John Legere made a case for the merger, saying it would enable the creation of what he termed a \u201cspectacular\u201d 5G network that would allow for wireless high-speed internet service in underserved areas.\nLegere said consumers using the planned T-Mobile-Sprint home internet service would get speeds of 100 Mbps and higher. The system would be so simple, he wrote, that consumers would be able to install it themselves.\nLegere also said 5G networks will give large wired ISPs more competition than they\u2019ve ever had before, which he predicted would lower prices for internet service.

You have to think a team with Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Dwight Howard will at some point get things together. The Lakers will be the surprise team of the second half of the season because they simply have too much talent to miss the playoffs. We've seen it in spurts, now expect them to sustain it for long stretches. The key for them, just like every other team, is staying healthy.\nAs for slippage, it's likely a tie between the Knicks and Nets. Both had strong starts, followed by inconsistency. The Knicks have owned the Heat but are still trying to prove their worth. Eventually, age will catch up to them. The Nets have yet to show they can compete with the Heat.\nThe Clippers already are headed to their best regular-season record in franchise history. But they should keep improving now that Chauncey Billups finally has recovered from a torn Achilles \u2014 the Clippers are 6-1 with him on the court. Billups, along with Chris Paul, give them a pair of field generals to guide a remarkably athletic but young team heading into the playoffs.\nMeanwhile, the Nets look like they're heading south. Deron Williams has had a truly mediocre season and was sidelined with swollen ankles just before the break. Equally worrisome is the play of a healthy but mercurial Gerald Wallace, who is having his least productive season (8.9 points, 5.2 boards) since becoming a starter nine seasons ago.\nThe Lakers better make the biggest surge ... or extra security will be needed to protect Dwight Howard from beloved teammate Kobe Bryant.\nMaking the playoffs was once low-hanging fruit for them. Now the darlings of dysfunction have just 28 games left to scramble for the eighth spot in the West, NBA royalty fighting for scraps. Nothing like seeing Kobe in desperation mode, baring his teeth. But L.A.'s schedule eases around mid-March.\nThe Bulls could be dangerous if Derrick Rose returns. The Hawks will fall if they trade Josh Smith. Ditto for the Celtics, who could deal Kevin Garnett and/or Paul Pierce.\nBut the real question is this: Have the Lakers hit bottom?\nThe Lakers will improve the most just because they have to, right?\nPerhaps the most consistent NBA quality is the competitiveness of Kobe Bean Bryant. His skills may be fading, but his will still rages. And one has to believe \u2014 with all that talent \u2014 the Lakers will figure out a way to improve over the final 30-some games.\nAs for the drop, it has to be the Knicks, doesn't it? Despite improved defense with Tyson Chandler and the intangibles that Jason Kidd always supplies, they still seem a house of cards, ready to collapse under the weight of playoff basketball. The Knicks appear to be the definition of a strong regular-season team that isn't suited for playoff basketball."}

As a result, information can travel faster or at the same speed using far less power.\nThe new transistor is capable of operating at 210GHz using just 1 milliamp of electrical current, or about 80 percent faster than current technology while using half as much power.\nIBM said the technique should pave the way for networking chips that can run at 80GHz, or twice as fast as today's fastest silicon-based chips. If successful, IBM could help chip designers avoid having to move more of their processors to more exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium phosphide.\n\"Silicon just wasn't going to go to these speeds,\" said IBM Fellow Bernard Meyerson, who is also vice president of the company's communications research and development center in East Fishkill, N.Y. \"In a nutshell, we've raised the bar dramatically.\"\nIBM has been a leader in blending germanium and silicon atoms to produce a material that conducts electricity more efficiently than pure silicon.

As policymakers consider renewal of the Higher Education Act, the \"Policy Toolkit for Today's Students\" outlines high-impact changes that would address barriers to college access and success\u2014including an increasing number, such as food insecurity and child care costs, that fall outside of the scope of traditional federal higher education policy.\n\"The needs and experiences of today's students are vastly different from what we saw even a decade ago,\" said Julie Peller, executive director of Higher Learning Advocates and a former deputy staff director for the Committee on Education and Labor in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"Our latest recommendations reflect the increasingly complicated lives of students and the need to employ every available policy tool to empower and support students.\"\nHigher Learning Advocates has advocated for changes to federal financial aid policy, and the latest recommendations both build on and extend beyond that work to address issues such as child care, economic security, hunger, and tax policy. The new package puts forward specific proposals that respond to the shifting demographics of today's students, who are increasingly working full- or part-time, raising children or caring for family members, or attending college as first-generation students.\nSpecifically, the toolkit proposes changes in three key focus areas: broad student supports, services for parent learners and working adults, and enhanced affordability. Each of these are essential to provide the basic necessities for student learners and their children, increase access and reduce financial burden, and ultimately increase the number of students completing degrees.\nOpen Educational Resources: According to recent data, 53 percent of students did not purchase or rent the required materials for a course on at least one occasion. The toolkit calls on Congress to boost appropriations for the Open Textbooks Pilot program at the Department of Education. Increasing open educational resources will help students gain access to the materials they need to succeed and will decrease the financial burden on students.\nFood Insecurity: Some students receiving federal financial aid miss out on nutrition assistance benefits for which they are eligible. The toolkit recommends creating a seamless process that automatically provides the lowest-income students who complete the FAFSA with information on SNAP nutrition benefits for which they may qualify.\nCampus Child Care Partnerships: Child care expenses averaged roughly $9,000 in 2018, and parent learners particularly struggle to find quality, short-term care. The toolkit calls for funding through the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG) to be an allowable use to encourage partnerships between institutions and local child care centers.\nChild Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG): The number of children served through the block grant program has declined significantly due to a 52 percent decrease in funds to child care providers between 2006 to 2015. The toolkit recommends increased investment in programs like CCDBG to ensure low-income parents are able to access and complete postsecondary education, increasing families' odds of socioeconomic mobility.\nFAFSA Income Verification: Students must not only navigate the complex FAFSA process, but almost a third each year are selected for additional income verification, a step that prevents many low-income students from ultimately receiving aid. In order to simplify the verification process, the U.S. Department of Education should exempt students who filled out their FAFSA by utilizing their tax information directly from the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.

Today, antibiotics are used to treat everything from bronchitis to tuberculosis. For decades, small doses of antibiotics have been fed to livestock; when used in feeds, they help maintain rapid growth and low levels of disease across herds, allowing for affordable food prices. However, controversy has recently erupted over concerns of antibiotic resistance and public health. Perhaps public opinion is driving the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) recent decision to reconsider the regulation of antibiotic use, even before facts are definitively established.\nAs the popular press has been oversimplifying for the past few weeks, over two-thirds of antibiotics in circulation today are fed to animals. Media outlets claim, through the use of scare tactics, that, the dairy industry is using antibiotics as a way to cut costs and allow animals to survive in an environment that is not healthy. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t pump our livestock full of antibiotics, they would get sick \u2026 But rather than raise them in a way that doesn\u2019t make them sick, but costs somewhat more, we just keep them on constant doses of antibiotics. And then we eat them.\u201dIt is a common misconception that meat and dairy products sold today have high levels of antibiotics present. It is important to note, first, that the FDA has many protocols and regulations in regard to use and presence of antibiotics in approved animal products. For example, established withdrawal times are defined, ensuring specific durations of time that must pass between ending antibiotic treatment and the animals\u2019 entering human food supply. Milk is sampled for antibiotic residues each day; farmers are required to withhold milk from therapeutically treated cows, or their entire shipment can be discarded. Obviously, from an economic and business standpoint, it is not in the farmer\u2019s best interest to allow milk to be processed with antibiotic residues. From a meat industry perspective, all beef sold in the United States is safe from antibiotics: The FDA has mandated standards for antibiotic residue presence in beef, which is regularly tested.\nSafe, affordable food comes at a high cost for consumers, but one must understand that public health is of the utmost concern. Officials make every attempt to conduct risk assessments of antibiotics, especially those critical for human medicine. A smear campaign has been in progress to discredit the farming community for being \u201cselfish,\u201d disregarding public health concerns for profit. Today, a successful farmer must not only be a good businessman, but must also be respectful of public opinion; without the public, there would be no consumer base, no one to feed, and thus, no income. Many of the best farmers have advanced college degrees and are well aware of the business and biological impacts of the decisions they make. A large percentage of the agricultural sciences programs here at Cornell are producing people who will be leading this industry into the next generation.\nEuropean governments have attempted to ban antibiotics in feed. In a case study in Denmark, all forms of antibiotics were prohibited across pork production. The nation encountered severe and costly health problems in livestock. Because the antibiotic ban was only on feed additives, Danish veterinarians had no choice but to use therapeutic antibiotics \u2014 of the same class used in human medicine and of greatest concern for resistance. Ultimately, more antibiotics were used in direct contact with animals, meat had to be withheld longer and eventually cost the"}

The Orioles also sent pool money for international signings to the Cubs, two pool slots totaling roughly $380,000.\nMost importantly, let\u2019s all stand up and give Duquette a round of applause for making this deal, sending two players who have struggled in Baltimore but are viewed by other teams as potential big roster pieces for a solid starting pitcher. He also made this trade on July 2, almost a full month before the trade deadline, giving the Orioles an extra 4-5 starts possibly from Feldman compared to making a deadline deal. A trade for Matt Garza, Bud Norris, or even Cliff Lee would have dug into the farm system and sent prospects away, but Duquette was able to capitalize on pieces that weren\u2019t being productive to the Major League club at the moment and acquired a piece that could help stabilize a rotation that is also about to get Wei Yin Chen back from injury.\nFor Arrieta, it has always been said that the change of scenery could be just what he needs. Well, now we get to find out how true that is. While analysts and sabermetricians alike have claimed over the years that this concept is mostly invalid, it certainly has shown true for the Orioles this season with Chris Davis, who for one has remarked that the move to Baltimore was one of the many factors in helping him become the player he is today.\nLet\u2019s not forget, Strop will most likely jump into the role of setup man for the Cubs behind closer\u2026Kevin Gregg.\nBest of luck to both Pedro and Jake out in the midwest.

This included a 25 per cent stake in Helena Water, the $300 million water treatment plant that provides water to more than 100,000 people in the state\u2019s Goldfields region.\nThe federal government established the water entitlements register last year in an effort to improve transparency and security of Australia\u2019s critical water assets.\nThe Australian Tax Office has been collecting information about foreign interests in water assets since July 2017 and will release its first ever report, similar to the foreign ownership of agricultural land register, later this year.\nUWA International Politics Professor Mark Beeson said given China\u2019s long term policy timeframes and the state of its domestic water supplies, it was reasonable to think they would have an interest in Australia's water assets.\n\u201cIn China\u2019s case they do have a much longer perspective, they do have a much broader sense of what security looks like and it does include things like economic security and environmental security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Chinese state is absolutely paranoid about any kind of social disturbance domestically.

Publications from Bon Appetit to Nation's Restaurant News have declared pimento cheese the hot food trend of 2011. And we know what that means, right?\nWords like \"artisanal\" are getting thrown around. It's getting paired up with fussy things like aioli, panko and Kobe beef. It's turning up in places it was never intended to go, such as sushi and cheesecake.\nIt's like we sent our child out into the world and she came home in high heels and too much makeup.\nShow some respect, people. After all, this is the food we call \"the pate of the South.\"\nDespite all the pimento cheese debates, one thing most sources agree on is that it started in the South, with a strong connection to the Carolinas. The latest to make the case is culinary history buff Rick McDaniel, who just published a book, \"An Irresistible History of Southern Food\" (The History Press, $24.99).\nAlthough he thinks pimento cheese probably dates to 1870 or so, the earliest printed recipe he found was in an Asheville book called \"The Queen of Appalachia Cookbook,\" dating from around 1910.\n\"I have no doubt (it's Southern),\" says McDaniel. \"I've never seen a pimento cheese recipe from a purely Northern cookbook.\"\nAlthough no one has a definitive answer to why people started using shredded cheese as a sort of mayonnaise-based salad, it took off quickly in the hot Southern summers and really became a staple during the Depression, when cheese was a cheap form of protein.\nWhen Durham food writer Emily Wallace was getting her master's degree in folklore from UNC Chapel Hill in 2010, she wrote her 80-page thesis on pimento cheese.\nWallace gave a lot of thought to the role that pimento cheese played as a product for female entrepreneurs in the South in the 1920s, and the way it managed to be a blue-collar lunch and a polite-society staple at the same time.\n\"A lot of foods, they start high and move down,\" she says. \"But (pimento cheese) really retained its status as a delicacy.\" For instance, Eugenia Duke, the founder of Duke's Mayonnaise, sold pimento cheese sandwiches in textile mills at the same time she was serving it at a tea room in a nice hotel.\n\"And I think that happened all over. As it hit the working class, it never left the tea room menus.\"\nWallace found that it still retains a strong pull in the Carolinas. When she interviewed the vice president of Moody Dunbar, the nation's leading canner of pimentos, she learned that 80 percent of all pimento cheese spreads are sold in 11 Southeastern markets - and the two largest are Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte.\n\"It's not a novelty here,\" she says. \"It's a thing of every day.\"\nDespite our affection for it, we Southerners haven't always treated pimento cheese with respect. While the best pimento cheese is homemade, pimento cheese spreads have been sold in supermarkets since the 1940s.\nAnd that wasn't always a good thing.

They searched his house, confiscated documents and records and placed the renowned sociologist and democracy advocate under arrest.\nThus began the latest flash point in the yearslong struggle between the Egyptian government and the country's fledgling pro-democracy reform movement. It is a struggle the government seems to be winning.\nIbrahim, a sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, remains in detention under investigation for an array of alleged crimes, including espionage for the United States, financial improprieties, forgery, accepting foreign funding without government permission and seeking to ruin Egypt's international reputation. The espionage accusation, which carries a maximum life prison sentence, alleges Ibrahim revealed Egyptian security secrets while speaking at a 1994 conference on Egyptian-American relations.\nHis detention has been extended twice, most recently on July 27, but no official charges have been leveled despite growing domestic and international pressure to either charge or release him. In both instances, the state security prosecutor gave no reason for the extension. Assistant Prosecutor Hisham al Soraya would say only that \"the investigation is ongoing.\"\nThis latest conflict has served as a sobering lesson for Egypt's non-governmental organizations, human-rights groups and civil society in general.\nIbrahim directs a for-profit think tank called the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Developmental Research. The key charges against him involve a European Union-funded documentary Ibn Khaldoun was producing to encourage voter participation in autumn parliamentary elections.\nIbrahim's peers in the ranks of Egypt's non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, view his detention as a warning against making trouble during the upcoming elections.\nIbrahim, who holds dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship, is a celebrity on the international lecture circuit and a popular, if sometimes self-promoting, source for foreign journalists. He met his American-born wife, Barbara, in the 1960s at a black power rally near Indiana's DePauw University, where he was teaching sociology. Barbara Ibrahim is a 1967 graduate of Palatine High School.\nActivists speculate that the government is taking down the biggest fish in the pond to serve notice that no one is untouchable.\nThe campaign against the pro-democracy movement comes at a time when such groups are seen as representing the few remaining forums for public expression in Egypt. The country's feeble opposition parties have been severely weakened, and formerly influential forums such as professional syndicates, the equivalent of labor unions, have been either co-opted or eviscerated.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings, Ibrahim has been subjected to a monthlong smear campaign in the state media, one that has branded him and by proxy all human-rights groups as tools for foreign interests seeking to sow dissent and taint Egypt's international image.\nMoustafa Bakri, editor in chief of Al-Osboa (The Week) newspaper, one of the leaders of the anti-NGO campaign, called Ibrahim and his peers \"the Trojan horses of the West\" who seek to undermine Egyptian society.\nEgypt's NGOs and human-rights groups long have been irritants to the government because of their efforts to highlight civil rights violations and endemic vote rigging.\nThe government attempted to force through a law last year that would have placed all Egyptian"}

Montreal, Busan and Rome berths will kick off a long series of screenings at general, Jewish and kid-focused fests.\nStranded somewhere between realism (especially in its spot-on depiction of the early \u201980s) and a more magical look at childhood with occasional visual flights of fancy (just like in \u201cHead\u201d), the pic tells the story of 9-year-old Rachel Gladstein (Juliette Gombert).\nRachel has grown up under the suffocating attention of her Tunisian-Jewish mother, Colette (Jaoui), in contrast with the disinterest of her largely absent father, Michel (Denis Podalydes), whose only topic of conversation, when he can be bothered to open his mouth, is the Shoah. Since Rachel also shares her bedroom with her sickly-looking maternal grandmother (Judith Magre), who surrounds herself with portraits of the dead, it\u2019s no wonder Colette believes her young girl is in need of a visit or two to a kind shrink, Madame Trebla (Rossellini).\nAs the pic progresses, however, and Rachel starts to hang out with wild-child classmate Valerie (Anna Lemarchand), the daughter of an uncomplicated if scandalously single mother, Catherine (Carre), it slowly becomes clear that the shy little girl just needs a playmate her own age, and is probably the sanest of the Gladsteins.\nTardieu adapted the book with original scribe Moussafir, and they have imposed a more classical story structure on what was a motley compilation of recollections (inspired by a one-woman show). But in the attempt to construct a fully formed family, in which each member has her or his cross to bear, what made the original such a compelling read \u2014 namely, the outlook of a sassy 9-year-old on a world she only partially comprehends \u2014 is further pushed into the background. The confessional visits to Madame Trebla are now only perfunctorily connected to the narrative, and the mother-daughter bond is but one of several occasionally shifting relationships. The fact that \u201cThe Dandelions\u201d was cut by three editors is of no help in keeping things focused.\nThankfully, the appealing cast ensures auds will stick with the characters throughout.

It was called \u201cWho Invited This Guy?\u201d and it was a Passover meditation of sorts, by Bruce Feiler, the author of \u201cWalking the Bible,\u201d who\u2019d once retraced the Five Books of Moses through the desert and learned that the ancient Israelites didn\u2019t cross the Red Sea, didn\u2019t build the pyramids and didn\u2019t normally sit \u201cerect,\u201d rather than reclining, while eating.\nMy friend had been planning to read the article out loud at her family\u2019s first-night seder, but when I invited her to my house, for the second night, she\u2019d decided to ditch her own seder and instead bring her charoset, gefilte fish, flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce, children, husband, mother and chosen text to me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really my holiday,\u201d she said.\nBoth her parents had been born Jewish, but she\u2019d been raised with no religion and her mother self-identified as Episcopalian.\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s O.K. with you,\u201d she said.\nSure, it was O.K. with me.\nI am Jewish.

Some of us just can\u2019t find a home for ourselves in the categories of identity that make sense for other people. Some of us are defined by little bits and pieces of experience and belief that together form a mosaic that for us, at least, is coherent and whole.\nHaving a very abstract sense of faith \u2013 or religion, or God, or whatever you want to call it \u2013 works perfectly for me. According to Newsweek this week, having such a \u201cpost-modern\u201d form of faith is becoming increasingly common among many other Americans as well.\nBut how do you pass that on to children? Can children apprehend religion or spirituality or even uplift in such a nontraditional way?\nThat world is gone \u2013 dead or dispersed.\nMy mother, like my father before her, when he was alive, performs our seders very quickly, skipping pages peremptorily, reciting the prayers almost ironically.

On December 31st, I went to pay my property taxes, and I asked myself the question, am I getting my money's worth?

As a result, nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy that multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent.\nAfter widespread condemnation from lawmakers in both parties, immigration activists and the United Nations, Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June that attempted to end the practice of family separation.

Protecting and managing key habitats would cost an additional $76.1 billion.\nAccording to the researchers, reducing the risk for all currently threatened bird species would cost between $880 million and $1.23 billion per year over the next decade. \u201cReducing the risk\u201d refers to improving the status of all birds listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species, meaning birds that are currently listed as \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d would recover enough to be listed as \u201cEndangered,\u201d while \u201cEndangered\u201d species would move toward the \u201cVulnerable\u201d category. Using this as their base, along with other data on the costs to protect other species of animals and plants, the researchers estimated that improving the status of all currently known threatened species would cost between $3.41 billion and $4.76 billion annually.\nFor protecting habitats, the researchers looked at what BirdLife calls Important Bird Areas: 11,731 land and marine sites identified as important to the preservation of biodiversity around the world. They say that effectively managing the 28 percent of those sites that are currently protected would cost $7.2 billion a year, and protecting the additional sites would cost $50.6 billion. The next task was to extrapolate this to protect all important sites for maintaining biodiversity. But according to BirdLife, 71 percent of the sites necessary to protect all other species are already Important Bird Areas. Using this as their model, the researchers came up with their final $76.1 billion per annum total to protect all of the world\u2019s important nature sites and the species that depend on them.\nIn a prepared release, Donal McCarthy, an environmental economist at both BirdLife and the RSPB, says getting this money wouldn\u2019t exactly be a sacrifice to the world economy: \u201cThe total required is less than 20 percent of annual global consumer spending on soft drinks.\u201d He told the BBC that bankers earned twice this amount in bonuses just last year.\nIn support of this paper, BirdLife released a new report (PDF) on October 12 that argues birds can be used to create strategic action plans to achieve 18 of the CBD\u2019s 20 \u201cAichi Biodiversity Targets\u201d (so called because they were established at the CBD\u2019s last meeting, in Aichi, Japan), which must be met by 2010.

This was despite the fact that the couple were providing a stable and caring home for the children.\nGoodman pointed out that there are times \u2013 such as physical or sexual abuse \u2013 when foster children must be removed from homes, but not over the existence of the Easter bunny.\nHe wrote: 'Given the disruption that these young children had already faced in their lives, there is no doubt that there was a need for stability, permanency and care in their lives. It is very clear from the evidence that the children were being cared for, that the Baars were providing them with stability and were turning their minds to the facets of care required for the children's development and happiness.\nThe Baars made their position against lying \u2013 including over the existence of Santa Claus \u2013 clear to the CAS before being accepted as foster parents, the court heard.\nThe court also heard how the birth mother was happy with the way the Baars provided Christmas celebrations in 2015, and made no mention of the Easter Bunny despite a series of exchanges between the two parties.\nThe executive director of the Hamilton CAS, Dominic Verticchio, apologised to the Baars through the National Post for what happened.\n'We recognise what our mistakes were,' Verticchio said.

{"idx": "20229", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Focus Politics What is radiation and why is it harmful?\nA brief overview of the four types of ionizing radiation, followed by a discussion of the EPA's proposed new rules for \"emergency\" radiation limits after an accidental release of radioactive materials.\nThere are four types of ionizing radiation: Alpha, Beta, Neutron and Gamma (and x-ray, which is a lower-energy emission than gamma rays, and thus less damaging, but otherwise identical to gamma ray emissions).\nThere are 20 levels or \"weighting factors\" of radiation damage from various emissions, depending on energy levels of the emission and type of emission/penetration capabilities (alpha, beta, neutron and gamma/x-ray each penetrate differently).\nBeta particles, gamma rays and x-rays are all classified as level 1 -- the least damaging for a given energy level. Alpha particles are level 20 -- the most damaging. Neutrons are classified at level 5, 10, or 20 depending on their energy level. Interestingly, the highest level of damage from neutrons is neither at the highest or lowest energy level, but in what might be called the middle energy level (100 keV to 2 MeV).\nAdditional classifications of radiation damage depends on what, if anything, the radioactive isotope \"targets\" (bone, thyroid, etc.). All such classifications are generally based on damage to an adult healthy (white) male.\nMost biological damage from radiation is probably due to the creation of \"free radicals\" in the body: Free radicals are molecules which become electrically unbalanced (\"charged\"). A radioactive emission can knock an electron out of its orbit around a nucleus. The unbalanced atom will then grab an electron from something else, which may then do the same thing to something else, and so on through lower and lower electron bonding energy levels.\nIf a DNA strand is involved, such events can permanently mutate that DNA strand. RNA can also be damaged, which might cause a cell to start producing a poison instead of a useful protein. If the damage simply causes cell death that's usually not so bad unless it's a heart or brain cell, which are not replaced during a lifetime. Most other cells in the body have limited lifespans anyway and die (self-destruct might be a better word) with various average life spans. Intestinal lining cells, for example, only live a few days, taste bud cells live about two weeks. However, if the damage causes either rapid (or slowed) cell division it can be much more dangerous.\nA radioactive isotope is not the same thing as a radioactive emission. A radioactive isotope has a \"half-life.\" A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a given quantity of a given type of isotope to decay. A radioactive emission is ejected from a radioactive isotope at the moment of decay. Different radioactive isotopes decay with different radioactive emissions, and those emissions have different energy levels.\nThere is no way to predict what the precise energy level will be, nor when the emission will occur, or what direction it will take as it leaves the radioactive isotope. Many types of radioactive decays result in another radioactive isotope being created from the original isotope. Sometimes as many as 20 different elements are created and then altered again, before a stable isotope (such as lead) is reached.\nFor alpha and beta particles, the emission lasts only until the particle (alpha or beta) slows down from about 98"}

Oh, and did we mention it was to warn the U.S. they would meet a \"miserable destruction\"?\nAccording to a news report from the North Korean Central News Agency, as translated by Reuters and the Associated Press, Pak Rim-su, the \"chief delegate of the North Korean military mission to the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom,\" called the head of the U.S. forces stationed in South Korea, Gen. James Thurman, to warn him against participating in upcoming scheduled military drills with South Korea.\nStarting on March 1, 10,000 U.S. troops are participating in land, sea and air maneuvering drills with 200,000 South Korean troops. Starting on March 11, 3,500 U.S. troops will participate in separate war simulation drills with South Korean troops.\nNorth Korea isn't excited about the idea. \"If your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises...at this dangerous time, from that moment your fate will be hung by a thread with every hour,\" Pak reportedly told Thurman, according to the North Koreans. \"You had better bear in mind that those igniting a war are destined to meet a miserable destruction.\" Sounds like it was a pleasant little chat. So cheery and welcoming, those North Koreans.\nUsually when North Korea wants to say something like this they just release a news report through the KCNA with whatever quotes they want to push, so if the phone call actually occurred it might be a big deal. But the U.S. has yet to confirm the conversation ever happened. There's a good chance North Korea is blowing smoke through a phone with no one on the other end.\nThough, it should be noted, a \"miserable destruction\" is at least slightly better than the \"final destruction\" North Korea threatened on South Korea during a U.N. nuclear debate earlier this week. North Korea really needs to expand its threat repertoire. All joking aside, this is, of course, still fresh off the successful nuclear test the country conducted. They tried to say it was a negotiating tactic with the U.S., but that was kind of dumb, and then all of a sudden their nuclear site was getting busy again."}

NBC's Michael Isikoff reports.\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- A single malicious email sent to workers at the South Carolina Department of Revenue last August enabled an international hacker to crack into state computers and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including Social Security numbers and bank account information, in what experts say is the biggest cyber-attack ever against a state government, according to details in a report released Tuesday.\n\u201cWe were a cocktail for an attack,\u201d Gov. Nikki Haley said, referring to the necessary ingredients for cyberassault, as she released a report by a computer security firm Mandiant, which was commissioned to investigate the data breach. At the same time, Haley accepted the resignation of her Department of Revenue director, Jim Etter, and acknowledged that state officials \u201ccould have done more\u201d to protect the personal data of state residents.\nThe release of the report came amid a mounting political uproar here over the cyberattack and criticism of Haley over her handling of the issue.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten more phone calls and emails about this than anything else in the last four years,\u201d said Tom Davis, a state senator and former chief of state to Gov. Mark Sanford. \u201cThere\u2019s a great degree of anger and frustration over what happened. This is information you\u2019ve got to give the government; if you don\u2019t, they put you in jail. There\u2019s a real sense of betrayal,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the Mandiant report, the cyberattack, which state sources say is believed to have originated inside Russia, started with a \u201cphishing\u201d scheme, a common tactic used by cyber criminals.\nLast Aug. 13, a hacker sent multiple South Carolina Department of Revenue employees a malicious email containing an embedded link containing malware or a computer virus. When at least one of the employees clicked on the link, the malware was activated and allowed the hacker to steal the employee\u2019s user name and password.\nFrom there, the hacker was off to the races. Two weeks later, the attacker logged onto the remote-access service for Department of Revenue computers, using the credentials of an employee who had clicked on the Aug. 13 email. The invader then \u201cleveraged the user\u2019s access rights to access other Department of Revenue systems and databases with the user\u2019s credentials,\u201d the report states.\nThe attacker performed \u201creconnaissance activities\u201d over the next several weeks, then started copying large amounts of data and transferring them onto zip files that were moved onto the Internet. The breach was not discovered until the Secret Service notified state officials on Oct. 10 that it had uncovered information that data on three state residents had been stolen.\nSince then, Haley and other state officials have scrambled to react as the magnitude of the attack has become increasingly apparent. In addition to 3.8 million tax returns, including the Social Security numbers of 1.9 million children and other dependents, the hackers got access to data on 699,900 business tax returns and 3.3 million bank accounts.\nThe attack has exposed vulnerabilities that experts say will cause state governments across the country to reexamine their cyber-defenses. Although South Carolina had encrypted credit card numbers according to industry standards, it had never encrypted the Social Security numbers. And some cyber experts say there is evidence that that data may now be marketed on Internet black market sites that peddle personal"}

But on the whole, he said, the emergency personnel were able to deal with the problem. Most of the hands-on handling of the chemical was done by members of the Goodwill hazardous materials team, from an area northeast of Reading. Members of the Reiffton hazardous materials team took care of the decontamination of the workers, Brown said.\nRecommendations that grew from the meeting included more frequent on-site briefings, better direction for media coverage, and more frequent rotation of personnel.\nAlso, Brown said, Berks County Emergency Management resources could have been better utilized. He said certain items, such as sand, were requested through other agencies, while the county has a direct contact for sand.\nSpotts said a Level Three team would have speeded up the situation, but would not have been that crucial. \"We did a lot of waiting until the cleanup crew got to the scene,\" he said.\nBlock said state police did not ask his company to handle the cleanup until after a Pottstown company declined the job, he said.\nPaul Ciotta, a DER spokesman, said his agency feels Keystone-Block should have handled the cleanup much more quickly.\nBlock said his workers had only spent two whole days at the"}

The four-story, 50-unit building, which is just under 50,000 square feet, is expected to open in July.\nThe development, and existing Rivertown complex, is at McDougall Avenue and Franklin Street, two streets south of Jefferson Avenue.\n\"The demand for that building has been the greatest we've ever seen,\" said PVM President and CEO Roger Myers.\nMore than 300 people have expressed interest in living there, but PVM won't begin taking applications until late March, he said.\nWith a $2 million grant from the Baltimore-based Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation in hand, PVM is getting ready to begin renovations on a second existing building on the site in August.\nThe 20,000-square-foot building, adjacent to the assisted living center, will be home to the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Green Houses on its upper floors. An alternative to nursing home care, the houses will provide a home-like setting, with 10-12 private rooms for senior citizens, a communal kitchen and living areas, social programming and 24-hour nursing care. PVM plans to put a cafe on the ground floor.\nThe goal is to open the houses and community cafe by late 2015 or early 2016, contingent on PVM's ability to raise the final $2.5 million needed to fund the second-phase projects, Myers said.\nThe total cost of the second phase is projected to be $13 million, Myers said.\nAs part of the new developments, PVM also plans to create additional parking to the north of the campus and a garden and park area \u2014 the Rivergarden Community Park \u2014 on property leased from the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, Myers said. The hope is to complete at least part of the park this summer. The park will be just south of the Rivertown development on the grounds of the UAW center.\n\"We really see this Rivergarden as being an asset, a resource for the surrounding area even though it focuses on the Rivertown neighborhood,\" Myers said, noting conversations with the Detroit RiverFront Conservancy are already underway to look for ways to tie in Riverwalk programming with the new park.\nThe second-phase projects are part of a $43.5 million senior community development that's been four years in the making. A $2 million grant from the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan from the Detroit Neighborhood Fund provided seed money for the project.\nOther sources of funding for the first phase included Detroit, Wayne County, the state and federal governments, the Masco Corp.

An equal percentage feel the same way about the policies of the Democrats in Congress.\nWhat do Americans think of Republican policies? Forty-three percent say the GOP's policies will move the country in the right direction. Nearly half of those polled said congressional Republicans would move the country in the wrong direction.\nBut the percentage of people who think Obama will move the country in the right direction has dropped 11 points since May, while congressional Democrats have seen a 5 point dip.

Still, he adds, \"The GOP may be in a more competitive position -- a comparison with poll results from May suggests that the gap between the parties has been closing.\"\nThe survey suggests that, by 13 points, Americans think the Democrats rather than the Republicans would do a better job handling the economy and Medicare. The Democrats have a 9 point advantage on health care and an 8 point edge on Afghanistan. The two parties are tied on the question of how they'd handle taxes and the federal budget deficit. The GOP holds a clear advantage on just one issue -- terrorism.\nAccording to the poll, six in 10 say that the GOP has not done enough to cooperate with Obama. A bare majority says the president has done enough to cooperate with Republicans, a significant drop the April result for the same question.\n\"Two-thirds of all Americans are angry at the way the government in Washington is working, and the Democrats get the brunt of that anger,\" adds Holland. \"But the amount of anger has not quite reached the level that polls found in 1994, when voters turned the Democrats out of power in Congress and elected a GOP majority for the first time since the 1950s.\"\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted August 28-31, with 1,010 adult Americans questioned by telephone.

{"idx": "20251", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The British invasion has returned, and it\u2019s brought a new wave of pop with it. Among these artists is Ellie Goulding, a 25-year-old from England with a strong voice and even greater drive. With the sudden explosion of \u201cLights,\u201d the title track of her debut album, Goulding has been propelled into the musical spotlight as a household name among pop-lovers. They won\u2019t be disappointed with the singer\u2019s new album, Halcyon. Although the album sometimes falls short with its over-synthesized accompaniment, Goulding\u2019s unique vocals and powerful writing make Halcyon a decent effort.The first thing one notices about Halycon is its dynamism. Goulding has undoubtedly channeled Florence & the Machine in this album, with dramatic, all-encompassing choruses and soaring vocals. \u201cHanging On\u201d is a perfect example of this, even featuring the harp \u00e0 la Florence. In this way, Goulding challenges the musical styles so preferred by the industry today. Whereas Lights was enjoyed particularly for its poppy audio, Halcyon offers a more engaging version of pop.Goulding\u2019s voice really shines in Halcyon. From soft, haunting croons to powerful choral harmonies, the singer\u2019s range is greater than that of Lights. Despite experimentation, Goulding still maintains her trademark folk vocals, reminiscent to those of folk artist Laura Marling. Sometimes, however, her vocal style seems out of place, and one wonders if perhaps she would be better suited to something outside the realm of pop. The overproduced sound is frequently distracting and fails to enhance Goulding\u2019s unique vocal talents.Lyrically, Halcyon features several moments of profundity, particularly in tracks like \u201cJOY\u201d and \u201cDead in the Water.\u201d With all of the excessive synths and vague lyrics, it\u2019s easy to ignore the album\u2019s overarching theme of breakup pain. \u201cThe lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him / and this was the ecstasy of love forgotten,\u201d sings Goulding in \u201cMy Blood.\u201d The singer certainly tries to present herself as a serious songwriter in Halcyon. The result is an album with more lyrical substance than Lights, but at times the lyrics are too vague to feel personal. If Goulding\u2019s goal was to make an album of emotional depth, it is sometimes lost in her attempts to be poetic.While Halcyon features a selection of impressive tracks, there are several disappointments. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cAnything Could Happen,\u201d does nothing to enhance first impressions of the album. In fact, it is one of the album\u2019s weakest, lacking the infectiousness of \u201cLights\u201d and the lyrical depth of Halcyon\u2019s other tracks. The single portrays Halcyon as weaker than it is, and seems to exist only to compete for the narrow requirements of mainstream pop success.Other tracks, such as \u201cDon\u2019t Say a Word\u201d and \u201cFigure 8\u201d are stylistically reminiscent of \u201cLights\u201d. Overproduced and simple, they feel out of place and detract from Halcyon\u2019s more powerful tracks. The album also features a collaboration between Goulding and D.J. Calvin Harris in \u201cI Need Your Love.\u201d The track is catchy but does not live up to the ambition of the rest of the album. These tracks may guarantee Goulding commercial success, but they are disappointing additions to the vocal and musical experimentation of Halcyon\u2019s other tracks.Overall, Halcyon offers an intriguing"}

The Lucas Artist resident at Montalvo Arts Center has been here since early June working on expanding the mindset of incarcerated men and women to imagine their lives outside of prison.\nIf that sounds big-picture and esoteric, that\u2019s the point. The work Sale does is primarily aimed at changing world views, starting with personal ones.\nSale has worked side by side with individuals who have conviction histories for serious crimes, survived jail and prison and are now rebuilding their lives with the help of support networks, policy advocacy and art.\nOne art project called \u201cFuture IDs,\u201d involves individuals drawing out their prison identification cards on large pieces of paper, then juxtaposing them beside new identification cards, like ones for college or a new job.\nSale and members of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition are bringing the \u201cFuture IDs\u201d project to San Quentin, where they\u2019ll also be running a workshop Sale is preparing curriculum for. A group of men who are incarcerated at San Quentin have volunteered to be a part of the workshop.\nMontalvo offers big thinkers like Sale a chance to step away from their every day and imagine. Resident artists are recommended from around the world and then invited to spend three months working on a project. Sale is here on his final month, which he elected to take one month at a time over the course of a few years.\nPlaying a key-facilitator role and co-authoring major projects, Sale says it\u2019s been good to have some time to step away from his life and reflect on what it is that he and his co-collaborators are doing. He\u2019s also been able to invite some of his collaborators to be with him in the hills for a couple days at a time, so that they can work together as a team during that reflection process.\nThe type of work that Sale does, connecting art with criminal justice reform, can be a challenging concept to grapple with, he says. Rather than serving as actionable change toward policy reform, it changes things on an individual basis, which not only changes the collective narrative of re-entry but can in turn have policy effects down the road.\nAt Montalvo\u2019s June Open Access Event, Sale showed a video clip of Anti-Recidivism Coalition member Dominique Bell telling the story of when he shared his \u201cFuture ID\u201d project with a busy U.S. senator.\nAlso speaking at the Open Access event was Michael Mendoza, who was formerly incarcerated and is now a political science student at San Francisco State University. He discussed the ways art helped him reframe his own narrative while he was incarcerated at age 15 for a total of 17 years.\nMendoza\u2019s narrative is the essence of what the \u201cFuture IDs\u201d project embodies. He now works with an organization called #cut50 to establish new Senate bills that allow fairer sentencing and more opportunities for parole for young people who are incarcerated.\nWhen people who are incarcerated can make sense of who they want to be upon their re-entry, it gives them an incentive to make the moves to get out. So Sale\u2019s question of whether arts and culture can help reframe the narrative of re-entry is answered through anecdotal evidence."}

He called for saving it.\nIn December 2008, when Congress and then-President George W. Bush were debating giving the auto industry a bailout, Trump gave several interviews in which he stressed the importance of saving the Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.\nTrump\u2019s position on an auto bailout was inconsistent leading up to Dec. 19, 2008, when Bush laid out plans to go forward with the bailout. Trump said the government should help the auto companies, but he also regularly suggested the they could save themselves if they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with some government support.\nMid 2009, months into his first year as president, Obama forced Chrysler and General Motors to go through bankruptcy.\nDec. 9, 2008, Fox: Trump told host Greta Van Susteren that \"I think you have to try and save the companies, and I think you can easily save the companies.\" He added, referring to \"bankruptcy,\" that auto companies \"don't like the \u2018B\u2019 word.

This year\u2019s state convention is in San Francisco between May 31st- June 2nd. During state Conventions held in odd-numbered years after presidential elections, these members of the DSCC elect the Officers of the California Democratic Party. Officers serve four-year terms.\nWhile the entire DSCC meets only once a year to conduct business at the State Convention, the Executive Board of the DSCC (E-Board) meets two more times each year to conduct business that arises during the intervals between conventions. There are approximately 320 E-Board members. At E-Board meetings, the standing committees and caucuses meet and conduct their business. In even-numbered presidential election years, the members of the E-Board elect the 19 DNC members that represent California on the Democratic National Committee in Washington, DC."}
{"idx": "20261", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Harold Macmillan, the Tory prime minister of the late 1950s and early 1960s, put me off Anthony Trollope. He said that reading the Victorian novelist was his favourite pastime, and that was enough to create a reading block.\nTime might have weakened the block, but then another Tory prime minister, John Major, rushed in to praise Trollope as well. That was the limit. Macmillan, after all, was capable of the occasional reactionary sparkle. Major was as boring as anyone could be (except, of course, Iain Duncan Smith).\nSo I could lap up Thomas Hardy and the Bront's, get a stimulus from George Eliot's megatomes, Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, and manage to break through a youthful aversion and enjoy Jane Austen. But Trollope remained literally a closed book (an unopened secondhand copy of The Warden).\nHence the shock I got from the first episode of The Way We Live Now on BBC the Sunday before last. The adaptation of this Trollope novel is magnificent-and timely. Most classic serials on TV are flashy but ponderous attempts at 'period charm'. Expensive sets and colourful costumes are used to present us with the dramatic equivalent of Ye Olde English teashops.\nEven the best actors with the best scripts have difficulty in giving any life to their characters, caked in makeup and squeezed into elaborate garments.\nThe makers of The Way We Live Now have taken a different approach. The 'now' means now, the beginning of the 21st century, even if the setting is 125 years ago. The story centres on the impact on the London upper classes of Melmotte, a financier recently arrived from abroad.\nNo one knows much about his background. There a distaste for him that combines snobbishness and anti-Semitic racism. 'We could not possibly have him in the house,' says one character.\nBut he seems to have immense amounts of money. And so the cream of London's aristocracy crowd around him even while their faces display ill-disguised contempt. His great scheme is a railway venture in Mexico. He knows the railway itself has no future.\nBut he also knows it can be promoted as a source of instant wealth for upper classes drones. And he knows too that their snobbishness hides their essential stupidity. They rush to join his board of directors and put their savings into his company as its shares soar in value.\nNone of them listen when the one upper class character who is not completely idle questions whether the railway is really being built. The portrayal of Melmotte is clearly modelled on Robert Maxwell, the fraudster newspaper owner who committed suicide ten years ago.\nLike Maxwell he is a bully who rejoices in the grossness of his own behaviour. Like Maxwell, he finds the high and mighty prepared to extol his virtues so long as he seems likely to line their pockets.\nIt does not take much imagination to see the similarities between railway shares in the 1880s and dot.com shares in the year 2000. This is not really a period drama. It's a parable for today (and compulsive viewing). It may even persuade me to open that copy of The Warden."}

That\u2019s only for the fancy credential-swinging media so I wasn\u2019t present for that session. I\u2019m sure very little of note took place. Maybe a dodgeball game broke out.\nThe biggest headline of the day was the predictable slew of roster moves the Pittsburgh Steelers made following their first preseason game. Dave Bryan outlined them earlier: OT Wade Hansen, DT Khaynin Mosley-Smith and CB Julian Whigham.\nTwo of that trio, Hansen and Mosley-Smith, spent the three day extended weekend with the team during rookie minicamp. The team wound up signing four players out of it \u2013 running backs Cameron Stingily and Brandon Brown-Dukes, wide receiver Marcus Tucker, and cornerback Donald Washington \u2013 one of the highest figures over the past five years. All four have generally proven to be worthwhile additions, though Washington may have already fallen out of favor with the team, playing zero defensive snaps Friday night.\nHansen\u2019s story in particular is really unique. A former D-III defensive tackle who battled Lyme Disease who walked onto Virginia Tech and became a starter.\nOf course, in-camp signings from the rookie minicamp pool aren\u2019t uncommon. But these transactions serve as a reminder that getting that invite, even if not ultimately signed out of it, is a foot and the door and acts as a business card to the team. Ready to be called up whenever needed.\nIt happened once last season. Jawon Chisholm lost the tryout bid to Stingily initially but was brought in following Ross Scheuerman\u2019s Achilles injury, spending the rest of camp with the team. That ultimately didn\u2019t lead to permanent placement by added to his resume and even more basic than that, let a small school kid from Akron live an NFL dream for a month.\nAnd in most years, several tryout players receive callbacks. In 2014, Jordan Hall was signed a month after the fact while Lew Toler was picked back up a few days before camp opened. Dayonne Nunley signed with the team during camp. This, despite the fact, no player was signed to the 90 man roster immediately out of rookie mini-camp.\nThis certainly isn\u2019t an \u201cexciting\u201d topic, it\u2019s quite literally my rainy day article, but it reminds us that every player is important and every player has a chance, even if their career seems to flame out before it begins.

(AP) \u2014 An agreement signed earlier this year by the U.S. and Mexican governments has allowed sweet, juicy Southern peaches to be sold in grocery stores south of the border for the first time in 17 years.\nFarmers in South Carolina and Georgia \u2014 the nation's second\u2013 and third\u2013largest peach producers \u2014 now have access to markets closed to them since 1994, when Mexico banned peach exports from the Southeast over concerns about invasive pests. The new deal involves strict protocols to keep fruit\u2013eating insects from being carried into Mexico.\nThe restart of exports likely means better prices for farmers, particularly now \u2014 at the height of peach season \u2014 when the largest quantities are being picked and sold, said Desmond Layne, a peach specialist at Clemson University.\n\"It gives them more places to sell their product for profit,\" said Layne, also known as \"Dr. Peach.\" ''That's a great thing for our growers. There are a lot of people in Mexico, and a lot of people who eat peaches.\"\nWhile Georgia is known as the peach state, California and South Carolina produce more. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates South Carolina will produce 90,000 tons of peaches this year, compared to Georgia's 40,000. Both states lag far behind California, expected to produce 815,000 tons.\nCalifornia peach farmers have had access to Mexican markets for more than 10 years, said Alyn Kiel, spokeswoman for the USDA's animal and plant inspection service, which began pursuing the agreement for South Carolina and Georgia in 2008. Export protocols differ among states because they have different pests, Kiel said.\nSouth Carolina and Georgia received clearance only after several years of negotiations. Even after the U.S. and Mexico signed a deal in February, the industry had to work out details for a Mexican supervisor to oversee field and packaging inspections on Southern farms.\nFrustrated by slow correspondence, Chalmers Carr, owner of the Southeast's largest peach farm, flew to Mexico with USDA officials in April for a three\u2013hour meeting with Mexican officials. An inspector arrived in South Carolina on May 31, and the first truckload of peaches bound for Mexico left Carr's Titan Farms in South Carolina in late June.\nBy Friday, the farm had sent 13 tractor\u2013trailer loads of peaches across the border to be sold at grocery stores in Mexico City and Monterrey, Mexico. Several more trucks were being filled Friday afternoon, each one carrying about 1,540 sealed boxes of peaches.\nFor Titan workers, it's a source of pride. The farm, which has half a million peach trees in three counties, employs 470 Hispanic workers through a federal migrant labor program. American and Mexican flags hang in the packing plant.\nWhen the first load left, workers cheered, Carr said.\n\"We're more than excited,\" said Esperanza Orozco, who's worked for Titan for 14 years and helps manage packing operations. \"We're very proud to work for this company, and now it goes from a Mexican hand to a Mexican mouth. The product we work with our hearts goes to Mexican customers.\"\nThe federal program requires the farm to provide transportation to and from Mexico, along with food and housing while the migrant workers are in South Carolina. Some workers would stuff peaches in their suitcases and other belongings to carry home to relatives"}

The communications has skyrocketed with 18 million people having cell phones. They've come a tremendous way with schools. Millions of kids, and especially girls, are going to school every day. They have made tremendous progress in education, in communications, in infrastructure and technology, and from a medical point of view.\"\nEven from a security perspective, the progress has been huge, he said. In 2001, Afghanistan did not have an army. Since 2006-07 when the Afghan Army was stood up, its soldiers have proven again and again that they are committed to providing a secure and safe nation for their people.\n\"They are unbelievable fighters,\" Richardson said. \"From the battalion level and below, we have accomplished a lot of training with them. They now have responsibility for their country and we have turned back to an advisory role. They're in the lead; we are there to advise and help. Our primary reason for being there is to provide training, advice and assistance to the Afghan Army and police.\n\"Now we are helping to put systems in place so they can acquire, manage and sustain the supply chain they need to support their Army. The people want us over there. We are part of 51 nations that have come together to work for this huge progress.\"\nRichardson said he has seen a sense of accomplishment among the U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. \"They are making a difference every day,\" he emphasized.\nIt's those experiences in the field -- during four deployments to Afghanistan and two deployments to Iraq -- that make Richardson \"humbled and honored\" to be selected to serve as AMCOM's commander.\n\"For 32 years, I was a customer of AMCOM,\" he said. \"We wouldn't have been able to sustain combat operations during 13 years of war without AMCOM.\n\"I wanted to give back to the Soldiers, and DA civilians and contractors who have given so much to me over 32 years.

FAMU's points were the results of two safeties.\nThe 1994 season marked the arrival of head coach Billy Joe. However, the inventor of the Gulf Coast Offense got off to a rough start for his first homecoming game. FAMU lost 24-20 to Morgan State. This would be the last homecoming defeat for the famed coach.\nIn 1996, FAMU exploded for a homecoming record 83-12 win over Morgan State. Quarterback Oteman Sampson and company posted 69 points at halftime.\nFAMU's 1997 grand game featured another clash with Southern. The Rattlers added to the homecoming celebration with a 33-3 win over the No. 1-ranked Jaguars.\nTypically, the game takes place in mid-late October.

One former staffer said they had never seen anything like it in their lifetime.\n\u201cMy jaw has been on the floor all day,\u201d one congressional aide familiar with the intelligence committees said.\nIt was an unprecedented breakdown in one of the Hill\u2019s most sacred relationships, with high stakes \u2014 it quickly raised questions about the ability of a key congressional committee to impartially investigate the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia. And the public was watching it deteriorate in real time.\nThe leadership of the Hill\u2019s two intelligence committees \u2014 one senior Democrat and one senior Republican from the House, and the same arrangement in the Senate \u2014 is one of last remaining pillars of cooperation on Capitol Hill. The relationship is close, happens almost entirely behind closed doors, and involves cooperative access and oversight of some of the country\u2019s most secret covert programs.\nNunes has put a fracture in that long-held tradition that may not be patchable.\nAs the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee each embark on their own, parallel investigations into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, there have been almost constant near-misses in upending the panels\u2019 respective bipartisanship. Schiff and Nunes have been publicly butting heads over the committee\u2019s probe almost since it was announced \u2014 with Nunes, who also helped lead the Trump transition team, a reliable voice for Trump\u2019s interests. Schiff, meanwhile, has challenged his credibility to lead the probe, given his closeness to the Trump campaign and transition.\nMeanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee leaders, Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner, had their own spat in February, when, at the behest of the White House, Burr called reporters and sought to tamp down stories on potential Trump-Russian connections. Warner was unsettled, and publicly said so. Some Republicans, in turn, were furious Warner talked. But while the incident threatened to upend the Senate\u2019s investigation into Russia, Burr and Warner both kept from airing further grievances publicly and, a month later, seem to be back on good terms.\nWithin that context lies what was perhaps Nunes\u2019 greatest transgression. The intelligence oversight committees have a uniquely secretive culture. Everything \u2014 legislation, bill proposals, reports, internal committee drama, even disputes \u2014 stays in-house. The strategy doesn\u2019t often bode well for the public, but it\u2019s indisputably a deeply ingrained culture unique to the committees.\nNunes apologized to his fellow committee members on Thursday for circumventing them before going to the White House. It\u2019s unclear how much credibility he can recover, or whether he can salvage the panel\u2019s probe \u2014 Sen.

The abode was equipped with a radio and refrigerator but not a television or running hot water.\nIn 1984, Mr. Shavitz picked up a 33-year-old hitchhiker, Roxanne Quimby, who became his business and romantic partner. Ms. Quimby, a former 1960s radical, first recycled his leftover beeswax into candles.

There was no research documenting the absence of new gossipy magazines from waiting rooms \u2013 so he set out to investigate that.\nThe results were pretty clear: after just one month, half (47%) of 87 magazines left in a general practice waiting room in Auckland, New Zealand, had disappeared, with newer magazines being much more likely to go missing than older ones. The limitation of the study is that it was conducted on a single clinic in New Zealand, so things may be different in other areas of the world.\nHowever, this raises an interesting question \u2013 what if waiting rooms were supplied with informative, non-gossipy magazines? People would take them and almost certainly read them; however, clinical staff opposed the placement of only non-gossipy magazines."}

Sanford doesn\u2019t add anything else, other than briefly mentioning one of Tuch\u2019s shootout celebrations at the Minnesota Wild\u2019s development camp this summer, which went viral on YouTube.\nAfter firing his shot in the net at the last possible second, Tuch spun around the goal and came back up the near side. He gave his dueling weapon a subtle twirl before slipping it back in his holster in a style that even Clint Eastwood would respect. He almost pulled off the impression without breaking into a wide grin, but halfway through an exaggerated strut down the ice, staring at the opponent\u2019s bench, he lost it.\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Tuch for smiling. It was a great shot, and a better reaction. YouTube commenters can argue all they want about whether the shot or the attempted save was legal\u2014all that matters to the rest of the world is that the whole sequence was awesome.\nIt\u2019s easy to toss around words like \u201cawesome\u201d when talking about Tuch. He\u2019s a guy who works hard and does everything a Division I athlete is supposed to do, but he\u2019s also an outgoing dude who\u2019s not afraid to have fun. Everyone has always seen that he\u2019s special on the ice.\nBesides standing at the same height as Tuch, Sanford could not be more different. He\u2019s the guy on the other end of the great-athlete spectrum, the one who somebody will invariably say leads by example but doesn\u2019t stick out in a crowd.

The latter two needed three seasons of NCAA hockey experience before they really broke out in their senior seasons, and even Gaudreau\u2019s stats had been relatively modest his freshman year. It was clear that the unavoidable loss of Johnny Hockey would leave a hole, but when a perennial hockey powerhouse enters a season ranked No. 4 in the country, the expectations are inevitably high.\nBoth Tuch and Sanford stepped up. They contributed on separate lines before Winter Break\u2014Sanford on the first line with Ryan Fitzgerald and Austin Cangelosi, and Tuch on the second with Chris Calnan and Adam Gilmour. In the first game after BC\u2019s two-week Christmas hiatus, with the team sitting at a non-spectacular 10-7-1, York pulled one of his usual shuffles to the lines, putting Tuch and Sanford together.\nThe Eagles went on a 9-1-1 stretch in their next 11 games, getting back into a place where they could contend.

When it comes to short-track racing, Kevin Ward's death isn't an outlier; it's part of a larger, more disturbing trend.\nAccording to data gathered by the Charlotte Observer, nearly 500 combined drivers, spectators, and crew members were killed during or at races between 1990 and 2010.\nMore than half of those deaths occurred at small oval events.\n\"It's possible we've missed a few incidents,\" says Gary Schwab, the newspaper's Sports Editor in charge of the study, \"so that's the minimum number. If anything, there's more.\"\nHe adds that there were actually a greater number of deaths at small ovals in 2001-2010 compared to the decade prior. There's a litany of possible explanations for this increase (track safety, more participants, loosely enforced safety regulations, a lack of experience among some drivers), but the disproportionate amount of fatalities on small circle and dirt tracks is certainly alarming.\nAnd while Kevin Ward's death may not point at a specific problem\u2014other than stronger rules to keep drivers in their cars unless they're on fire\u2014it incidentally shines a light on other endemic problems facing small-track operators, competitors, and fans.\nIf anything, these statistics\u2014which the Charlotte Observer is careful to point out are not intended to be a comprehensive survey, but rather a sample\u2014should be used as a starting point to gather more data and determine a way for short-track racing to survive and safety to improve."}

Without the votes of my political group, there will not be a new Commission president.\nLooking at the election results, what mission did Europeans give the elected MEPs?\nThe EPP has won the elections. The voters have made us, by far, the strongest force in the European Parliament. We agreed then that Jean-Claude Juncker would become Commission president. And this is the goal I am pursuing. On the other hand, the majorities in the European Parliament also mean a mandate to cooperate with constructive powers.

{"idx": "20304", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Queen's Park is obliged to pay close attention when one of its own top planners warns that a provincial strategy meant to reduce urban sprawl and protect the environment will, in fact, do the opposite. That's what's in store for the Simcoe region, north of the GTA, if Ontario proceeds with its flawed intentions, according to Victor Doyle, manager of community planning at the ministry of municipal affairs.\nTellingly, this senior civil servant made his views known as a \"private citizen,\" with a written response to the province's call for public input on the strategic growth plan for Simcoe.\nThe Simcoe growth plan is the responsibility of the ministry of infrastructure, not municipal affairs. One can only speculate on how far communications between these two branches of government have deteriorated when a veteran bureaucrat feels it necessary to go outside the system in order to be heard.\nDoyle's concerns, summarized in a 15-page presentation, deserve consideration before the government proceeds with its \"growth vision\" for the Simcoe area.\nHis most compelling argument against the new development planned in open spaces along Highway 400, roughly between Barrie and the Holland Marsh, is that it's simply not needed. According to Doyle, there's plenty of space for industrial and other uses within the Greater Toronto Area, where about 34,000 hectares of open land have already been approved for urbanization. Surely it makes sense to develop this space before encroaching on the more remote greenfields of the Simcoe region.\nAs well, Doyle points out that Lake Simcoe has limited capacity to assimilate waste water, including the urban runoff that's inevitable with large expanses of paved space. That means removing sewage from planned developments would likely require pipeline construction on a massive and enormously expensive scale. Simcoe County lacks the legislative authority and staff needed to run sewer and water systems of such size, notes Doyle. Prime farmland would be lost to urbanization \"without any justified need.\" And Highway 400 would become even more clogged with traffic than it is now, especially since long-term plans for public transit don't include major improvements to service in Simcoe County.\nThe cumulative effect of all this would be to continue the pattern of urban sprawl beyond the greenbelt and along Highway 400, in direct contravention of the province's planning goals, concludes Doyle. \"There is absolutely no reason, or rush, to consider any further urban expansions, or new development areas, in south Simcoe County.\"\nThere are, of course, arguments on the other side, from both the development industry and the ministry of infrastructure. But before locking the province into a scheme that could induce more sprawl, the government would be well-advised to heed Doyle's warnings and give the Simcoe growth plan a serious second look."}
{"idx": "20305", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: No business can survive without access to capital. There are several common types of business financing options available to young companies.\nAngel investors are an excellent source of early-stage financing. They are often willing to tread where there is too much risk for banks and not enough profit potential for venture capitalists. Angels will invest for a longer time than other investors -- up to three years or more. They may also invest smaller amounts -- $1 million or less.\nVenture capitalists, by contrast, have stringent investment criteria and generally invest in high-growth technology companies. Because they want a way to cash out in three to five years, many venture capitalists shy away from very new businesses and rarely invest less than $3 million to $5 million at a time.\nAccepting a venture capital investment also represents the potential loss of independence for owners because venture capitalists often take an active role on the company's board and may push a specific growth agenda.\nCommercial loans are attractive because they don't require entrepreneurs to turn over equity or company control. But paying off debt can drain a young company with limited cash flow. New companies may not even have access to bank loans if they have no operating history and no collateral to secure the loan.\nBusinesses seeking $100,000 or less, however, can often find loans through a simple application process focusing on the owner's personal credit history. Business owners with personal assets may also be able to obtain loans secured by those assets.\nSmall Business Administration loan guarantees can mean the difference between getting a bank loan and being entirely shut out. The federal agency loans no money directly. Instead, it guarantees a portion of individual loans made by private lenders.\nBut a business must first show that it cannot obtain conventional financing at reasonable terms. Business owners must personally guarantee SBA loans and must also show cash flows sufficient to repay the loan. Most commercial banks offer information about SBA loans.\nHome-equity loans are a cost-effective alternative to other types of loans because they offer some of the best interest rates available. But you may not want to risk your family home to start your business venture. Before going this route, you should carefully consider the risks involved.\nCash advances from credit cards are an easy and quick way to gain access to cash. But as a long-term financing method, they can be expensive. Credit card interest rates typically run much more than the 1 to 3 percent over prime you would likely pay on a bank loan.\nIf you use credit cards, shop for the best interest rate. Introductory teaser rates often give you a bargain for up to six months. If you have the time and energy, you can roll over your debt to a new card every six months, taking advantage of a new teaser rate.\n-- You have a sound company strategy and business plan.\n-- Your management team has drive, ambition and relevant experience.\n-- Your target market is substantial and growing rapidly.\n-- You have a clear understanding of your business.\n-- You have a clear understanding of the competitive landscape.\n-- Your business has a proprietary or differentiated product.\n-- Your business can realize significant gross profit margins and significant revenue growth.\n-- Your business has the potential to be a home-run investment..\nInvestors expect to see a business plan that paints a realistic financial picture of the anticipated growth of the company. If the plan is overly aggressive and inconsistent with growth in the industry, your credibility may be questioned.\nBe realistic with your financial projections, and be prepared to explain how you arrived at the numbers."}

Tell me about its history.\nStewart Bainum, Jr.: The Bainum family and Choice Hotels\u2019 story is really about the American dream. My father, Stewart Bainum, Sr., was 17 when he hitchhiked from Cincinnati to Washington, D.C., with $3 in his pocket searching for opportunity. He worked odd jobs and eventually saved enough money to start a plumbing business and then to open his first hotel, which started it all. He became president and CEO of Quality Courts United, which later became Choice Hotels. I spent summers in my father\u2019s first hotel working a range of jobs, including janitor, and learned the importance of hard work. I eventually joined the leadership team in 1976 and became chairman in 1987, overseeing Choice's growth from a franchisor of 290 hotels under one brand in the U.S. to over 6,900 in more than 40 countries and a market cap of over $4 billion.\nReiss: Who is Choice Hotels today?\nPat Pacious: Choice Hotels has grown from a nonprofit referral chain of seven motels in Florida to a global enterprise representing one in 10 hotels in the U.S. and spanning the upscale, upper midscale, midscale, economy, and extended-stay segments.

{"idx": "20321", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The fact that the Messiah will open the eyes of the blind is a recurring theme of the book of Isaiah and the Gospels. The Bible clearly describes the person who is lost in their sin as being spiritually blind. The Bible speaks figuratively of the lost person having scales on his eyes that must be removed before he can come to faith in Christ. Three years ago, I had the good fortune to have a most interesting conversation with a delightful young lady who was born blind. She was thirty years of age. She was at that time working in a small family owned business but had been previously employed for three years in the human resources department in the corporate headquarters of a Fortune 100 company here in the United States. In both positions, she entered data into spreadsheets among other tasks. I have trouble doing that and I can see fine.\nI asked about her training and she described some of her schooling. One of her final assignments before graduating from a school for the blind was to learn to cross streets alone at busy intersections. Once she mastered that, she was tasked with crossing an interstate highway by herself. I cannot imagine how to begin that process. I would have been terrified. The courage required to take that step of faith out into the pavement must have been all that she could have possibly mustered. I feel quite certain that I would still be standing in the ditch having never gotten up the nerve to take even one single step.\nI suppose that the lost person, separated from God and spiritually blind, is in a somewhat similar situation. The lost person must take a step in blind faith. Know for certain that faith in Christ is not totally blind. There is much evidence for trusting Christ but in the end faith is required. In fact, the Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God. That is exactly why a person will not receive another chance to come in faith to Christ after death. At that point, he or she will see Christ as He is, looking into the face of Almighty God. That is sight not faith. I would also remind you that a belief that there is no God requires faith as well.\nAt some point the spiritually blind person must find the strength and courage to step out in faith into the unseen and unknown. My illustration breaks down here because my young blind friend remained blind after crossing the interstate. However, much like the Apostle Paul, the spiritually blind person upon stepping out in faith has the scales drop from his eyes so that he is no longer blind. 2 Corinthians 4:3-6 among other passages describes the situation, And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who said, \"Light shall shine out of darkness,\" is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. (NASU) May the Light of Christ shine in your heart and may God grant you the strength and faith to step out in courage trusting Christ as your Lord and Savior."}

The G8 leaders hope that a large infusion of aid money will prevent these countries from sliding away from the \u201cdemocracy\u201d they claim to be establishing.\nMany of the leaders attending the Group of 8 working meetings last Thursday and Friday expressed concern that in the absence of a quick infusion of significant cash, the summer following the Arab Spring will burn and wither the new buds of democracy taking root in the Middle East. \u201cWe members of the G8 strongly support the aspirations of the Arab Spring, as well as those of the Iranian people,\u201d proclaimed in a memo published after the conclusion of the late night confab.\nPresident Obama is credited with organizing this choir. A spokesman informed the New York Times that European leaders had gladly added their voices to the chorus calling for aid.\n\u201cChancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy, a number of leaders, have all stressed the importance of using these meetings to show a unified front in providing support for Egypt and Tunisia,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.\nThere is little doubt that the lion\u2019s share of that aid package will come from the United States. While there were few detailed denominations provided in any of the statements praising or pronouncing this latest unconstitutional promise of foreign aid, there were a couple of specific starting points provided.\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Mr. Obama on Wednesday that Britain would support the effort, and it would pledge $178 million. American officials said they had gotten encouraging signs from Germany and France, even if neither has made a concrete pledge.\nThe International Monetary Fund, which has had a team in Egypt for the last week, is readying a package worth $4 billion to $5 billion to help it bridge a financing gap, a fund official said. Egyptian officials said their economy, damaged by unrest that halted trade and tourism, will need an infusion of $12 billion just this year to steady itself.\nLast week, Mr. Obama announced $1 billion of debt relief and $1 billion in loan guarantees for Egypt. The European Union plans to increase its aid by $1.75 billion.\nThere is no doubt that President Obama would not welcome the taking of a similar tack by the American people regarding our own government. What would be his reaction (and the reaction of the coterie of congressional co-conspirators) be if en masse the citizens of the United States informed the federal government that we would be happy to fund the government pending its demonstration of reasonable and \u201csuitable reform efforts\u201d toward adhering to the principles of limited government set forth in the Constitution?\nThis generous proffer of largesse comes at a curious time, given the global economic recession. The manipulation of the economies of the nations represented by the G8 by their respective centralized banking authorities through the creation of never-ending \u201cboom-bust\u201d cycles has left these nation\u2019s ravaged financially.\nInstability is a concern not only for the nations experiencing the Arab Spring, but also for the very nations offering them money to avoid it.\nThe European Union and the I.M.F. have tried for the last year to calm the bond markets.

But what are the best options for the average broke college student who can\u2019t afford a $50 bottle of wine? Each week, columnist Susana Alcantar will discuss different wine options for under $15, where to get them in Westwood and which are worth your money.\nNo New Year\u2019s Eve celebration is complete without flutes of bubbly wine.\nMany of us are familiar with sparkling wine, although we often refer to it as Champagne. However, most of the Champagne can\u2019t be labeled as Champagne unless it was specifically made in the Champagne region of France.\nAs I shopped for sparkling wines, I decided to purchase sparkling wines from different regions, as I\u2019ve heard different regions can result in different tastes.\nThe first wine I purchased was Cook\u2019s Brut California Champagne for $10.99 at Rite Aid. When I saw the bottle I was confused as to why it said Champagne on the label when it wasn\u2019t made in France. After some online research, I discovered sparkling wines made in the United States can be labeled as Champagne if produced prior to 2006.\nI got back home and immediately opened the bottle to share a glass with my roommate, celebrating our last days of freedom as midterms approached. The color of the wine was a pale yellow, almost transparent. It was also very carbonated, which made me smile \u2013 the bubblier the wine, the better.\nAs I took a sip, I felt the bubbles tingle in my mouth and I loved it. I tasted apple and peach flavors but they were not overpowering \u2013 if anything, I would have liked for the fruit flavors to be even more well-defined. However, the wine did taste a bit watered down, a problem I have encountered with previous wines as well.\nI also bought an Italian wine called Ruffino Prosecco for $12.84 from Ralphs, which I was excited to try due to my previous experience with an Italian sparkling wine a few years ago at a wedding.\nThe color of the Ruffino was darker than the Cook\u2019s and the wine was not as bubbly, but I preferred the subtle fruity smell of this wine over the previous one because it was not as intensely sweet.\nThe taste of the wine also reflected its toned-down aroma \u2013 it was dry but not to the point where it started to feel too heavy to drink. In fact, the fruit flavors seemed almost nonexistent as I drank the wine. The description on the bottle said it should have lingering fruit notes, but they dissipated after a short while.\nThe final wine I purchased was Louise d\u2019Estree Methode Traditionnelle Brut for $7.99. It\u2019s the cheapest option out of the three and also happens to be French, which is supposedly the best kind of Champagne.\nAs soon as I saw the color \u2013 a dark, unattractive shade of yellow \u2013 I was apprehensive. However, I liked the smell, sensing nuanced floral notes with minor fruit flavors, a combination I did not encounter with the previous two wines.\nThe wine fizzled as I drank it, hitting me with hints of citrus.

Self-employed and freelance workers who have tried to get a new loan in recent times - whether to remortgage or take their first step on the housing ladder - have faced a uphill battle, particularly those unable to demonstrate they have a regular income.\nThe end of self-certification mortgages, which have become virtually extinct in the last year since the regulator proposed stricter affordability checks, has been a particularly savage blow for self-employed borrowers.\nSelf-cert deals were labelled \"liars' loans\" as they didn't require borrowers to prove their income. But while they were undoubtedly abused during the housing market boom years, they were a vital and valid mortgage option for the self-employed.\nMelanie Bien, director of mortgage broker Private Finance, said: \"Self-cert mortgages have disappeared as lenders are insisting on proof of income before they will lend. While this sounds fair enough, those who have only recently set up a business and don't have the requisite accounts are finding that they can't get the mortgage they need.\"\nThat isn't to say that lenders will slam the door in your face if you're self-employed - it just means it could be significantly harder to get the mortgage deal you want.\nDavid Rolleston, director of Mortgage Advice Brokerage in Glasgow, said: \"The same deals are available as to people who are employed, it's just the paperwork required by the lenders to prove income that can sometimes be an obstacle.\"\nBien agreed, urging self-employed mortgage applicants to pull together as many documents as possible to help prove income.\n\"It helps if you have contracts lined up to demonstrate income going forward and have a track record in the particular industry you are working in. Check your credit file while you are about it and get any mistakes corrected, or unfair information amended.\"\nRolleston advises self-employed mortgage applicants to ask their local tax office for a copy of their SA302, which shows the income declared for the latest tax year.There is a potential drawback here for self-employed people who downplay their income on their tax return in an attempt to cut their tax liability, as it may seem that they don't have sufficient income for the mortgage they want.\nRolleston added: \"Many lenders put various obstacles in place in terms of what accountants' qualifications they will accept and for small sole traders who don't wish to pay the more expensive accountancy fees charged by a chartered company this can cause a problem.\"\nBut he said that lenders are, on the whole, accepting SA302 documents, primarily because they are provided by HM Revenue & Customs.\nBorrowers can boost their chances further by providing at least three years of submitted accounts, although some lenders will accept two years' worth of records. There are technical matters to think about when it comes to submitted accounts, however. For example, if you're not filing your accounts for the 2010-11 tax year until next January, an application made before then would be based on figures up to the end of April last year.\nRolleston said: \"This would make them older than 18 months and again this can cause lenders problems as they haven't got the most up-to-date figures available to assess the applicant properly.

Ehren Watada. Lt. Watada is the first U.S. Army officer to refuse orders to deploy to Iraq. He has refused orders on the basis that the war is illegal and unconstitutional and because his oath of office prohibits him from obeying illegal orders. He also understands that if he obeys an order that is illegal, that, too, could implicate him in war crimes or crimes against humanity.\nLt. Watada is scheduled to be court-martialed at Ft. Lewis on February 5th. Many of us will be there to bear witness to the charade of justice. He is charged with disobeying orders to deploy to Iraq, with conduct unbecoming an officer by publicly stating his opinions and by expressing public disagreement with the war policy of Mr. Bush. The colonel in charge of the legal proceedings has ruled in preliminary hearings that Lt. Watada will not be allowed to put on evidence or testimony regarding the falsity of the premises for war in Iraq, its illegality under U.S. and international law or the illegality of the continued occupation of the country. In short, Lt. Watada will be tried, convicted and sentenced to prison without an opportunity to defend himself.\nThe purpose of the Citizen's Hearing was to put on in public and under oath the testimony that Lt. Watada has been forbidden to present in his own defense.\nMore than 500 citizens came to the Evergreen College Campus in Tacoma to hear expert and factual testimony presented to a diverse panel of citizens.

The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate.\nIf the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we\u2019re not used to riots: We are. England caught fire during that other royal-wedding year, 1981. But 30 years ago, the battle lines were relatively clear. Race was central, especially in the predominantly black south London neighborhood of Brixton. The target then was a police force charged with racial bias. But the recent explosions have had none of that clarity.\nEven though the troubles ignited last week after the police killing of a black Briton in the north London area of Tottenham, the copycat outbursts since have lacked that racial dimension. Among the looters, all races have been represented, while their targets have not been overtly political. They have not hurled stones at police stations, city halls or the Houses of Parliament. Instead, these rapidly mobilized crowds have concentrated their fire on stores, especially those selling cellphones, sneakers and large-screen TVs. One looter was seen trying on different pairs of shoes, making sure she stole the right size.\nThe Guardian\u2019s Zoe Williams has called these the \u201cshopping riots,\u201d noting the way the mobs move from malls to main-street stores, avoiding confrontation with the police, in contrast with the 1981 rioters, who actively sought it. If today\u2019s looters have a political point to make, it is that politics doesn\u2019t matter.\nFor the moment, the focus is on stopping the looters. Prime Minister David Cameron, who said Wednesday that he is ready to use water cannons and rubber bullets, is keenly aware that a government\u2019s first duty is to secure the realm. His press critics have warned that if he didn\u2019t get things under control, this could be his Hurricane Katrina. Equally under pressure is London Mayor Boris Johnson, who must be mindful that in just one year the city is due to host the Summer Olympics. Many Londoners are hoping that the image that will linger in the world\u2019s memory is that of volunteers wielding brooms, determined to clean up their city.\nMost controversial is the suggestion that the riots might have even a tenuous link to the government\u2019s austerity program, aimed at reducing the deficit. Funding for youth services \u2014 clubs and outreach workers \u2014 in the Tottenham area has just been cut by 75 percent. Those schemes used to keep some of the toughest kids off the streets, but no longer.\nIt\u2019s too early to know whether spending cuts played any part in England\u2019s burning. But as the United States embarks on its own retrenchment, it should beware \u2014 this is an argument that could soon be coming your way.\nJonathan Freedland is an editorial page columnist for the Guardian.

Well, the windmill will be reconstructed and, if all goes well, its sails will be spinning by 2009. The city had no money to refurbish the windmill, which takes its name from banker Samuel Murphy, who donated it to the city in 1905. So, a nonprofit group, called Save the Golden Gate Park Windmills, was formed to restore it and the smaller Dutch Windmill, which also sits near the northwest corner of the park. The group raised nearly $5 million to take the Murphy Windmill down and ship its antique machinery - main shaft, brake wheel, gears, fantail and sails - to the Netherlands, where it is all being restored by a Dutch company that has been designing and building windmills since 1868.

That is how much Albertans have paid to the rest of Canada in net federal fiscal transfers from 1961 to 2017 \u2014 that is, federal taxes paid by Albertans net of federal spending in Alberta (all numbers in 2017 dollars).\nIn a presentation last week in Calgary, Tim Hearn and Robert Mansell of the University of Calgary\u2019s School of Public Policy also noted that in just the past eight years alone, since 2010, Albertans have paid $180 billion in net fiscal transfers, more than any other province.\nJust think about that. In 57 years, Albertans have paid almost as much in transfers to the rest of the country as the total of our entire federal debt today. It\u2019s a transfer averaging $3,674 per Albertan every year. Over 57 years, it totals $209,418 per Albertan.\nNo other province has contributed so much to the rest of Canada via federal taxes and spending. Ontario has a population three-and-half times larger than Alberta, but it only transferred $45 billion to the rest of the country since 2010, just a quarter of Alberta\u2019s handover. (Going back to 1961, Ontarians contributed the largest amount, $722 billion in the 57 years up to 2017, but not the largest per capita).\nSo who gained the most from Albertans\u2019 money? Quebec got the largest chunk, obviously, with $476 billion dollars in net federal fiscal transfers or $1,172 per Quebecer since 1961. It takes the lion\u2019s share of transfers from all the provinces.\nBut a host of other, much smaller, provinces have also been raking in big money transfers from Confederation since 1961: Nova Scotia, $306 billion, or an average of $6,034 in extra money per resident per year; New Brunswick, $203 billion or an average extra $4,909 per year, per resident; Manitoba, $175 billion, or $2,712 per resident bonus every year; Newfoundland, $172 billion, or $5,501 per resident per year.\nBut on a per capita basis, the biggest winner has been Prince Edward Island. With a population barely even half that of Regina, P.E.I. has over 57 years collected an average of $8,478 for every Islander, furnished by other provinces. A good chunk of it, of course, from Alberta.\nNow, Albertans know they have been graced with natural resources that have contributed to their wealth. And Canadians outside Alberta routinely use that fact to rationalize why they think it\u2019s only fair, therefore, that Alberta should be made to share its wealth.

{"idx": "20336", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Light bent by galaxies helps humans see farther into space.\nMore then six decades ago, Albert Einstein predicted that the gravitational pull of galaxies in deep space would create natural lenses that would bend light and greatly magnify distant objects. Yet the great physicist also predicted that these far-off lenses would be so difficult to find that mankind would never locate one.\nIn 1979, astronomers confirmed Einstein's theory by finding a distant gravitational lens in the form of a spectacular mirror image of a bright young galaxy, called a quasar. Now, thanks to vastly improved technology, astronomers today are finding more and more gravitational lenses in the skies. Indeed, today researchers working with the Hubble Space Telescope announced that they had located eight more, increasing the total number of known gravitational lenses by almost 20 percent.\nOnce considered an exotic curio, these lenses are giving scientists a remarkable opportunity to glean answers about the origin, shape, and composition of the universe. And perhaps most intriguing, they even may hint at whether the universe will continue expanding or eventually fall back in on itself.\n\"Gravitational lenses promise to provide one of the best handles we'll ever get on what the geometry of the universe is and how the components of the universe came to be the way that they are,\" says Joseph Lehar, an astrophysicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.\nThe concept of a gravitational lens is grounded in Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which states that light is affected by gravity. A massive object with strong gravitational pull, such as a galaxy or cluster of galaxies, acts like the lens on a magnifying glass. The gravity of this foreground galaxy bends the light coming from an even more distant object located directly behind it.\nThis creates a greatly magnified and distorted image of the second distant object. The distorted image often appears as a spectacular array of exotic rings and arcs that are in fact heavenly mirages.\n\"If you take a wineglass and hold it in the bright light, you would see multiple images. The base of a wineglass works like a lens that bends light and creates multiple images,\" says Kavan Ratnatunga, an astrophysicist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"In this case, the galaxy creates multiple images of what's behind it.\"\nUntil recently, finding gravitational lenses was nearly impossible. They create images of faint, distant objects billions of miles away that are hard to detect and study even with the most powerful telescopes. Separating the lensed image from much brighter signals emitted by the foreground galaxy is likewise difficult. Furthermore, there are billions of objects in the sky.\nBut scientists learned that in about 1 of every 400 cases, gravitational lenses accompany quasars that produce radio waves. That - along with improving technology - has allowed researchers to winnow the candidates.\nAs a result, the number of known gravitational lenses has skyrocketed from a handful a decade ago to more then 50 today- and the pace of discovery is accelerating.\nIn addition to the discovery of the eight new gravitational lenses announced today by Dr. Ratnatunga and several colleagues, several other research teams are also looking for gravitational lenses. The spate of detections in recent years has vaulted gravitational lenses from anomalies to statistically significant events that can be meaningfully studied. \"We've just moved from the truly pioneering stages to the point where we can do serious cosmological tests,\" says Christopher Impey, a University of Arizona astronomer.\nThe uses of the information they gather will have profound effects on"}

Walter Thompson, advertising was shaped by a client's communication objectives and budget, but was always molded into effective communication by someone charged with the creative execution.\nTimes have changed in the past 130+ years. There are many more ways to advertise (than the religious magazines J. Walter ran ads in), many more formats (radio, video, Flash), and precision for ad placement has vastly improved (from sandwich boards on a sidewalk to the behavioral, contextual and geographic targeting we see today).\nNo doubt technology has played a significant role as a driver of change for advertising (the first television ad was broadcast in 1941).\nOnline video advertising is poised to be the next driver of change in advertising. The ability to run high quality video online, target them to the right audience, measure the ads' effectiveness in more meaningful ways (beyond the click), and make changes on the fly in response to performance data is an amazing leap forward.\nChange in whatever technology form it comes in, however, is not the source of creativity; nor is it what ultimately drives video ad effectiveness -- it's just an enabler.\nWe're often asked what makes for an effective online video ad. We analyze and measure impacts on engagement rate and exposure based on play mode, length of video, initial thumbnails, actionable overlays -- but time and time again, it comes down to what's the message, how well the \"story\" is told, and what the offer is.\nWe have seen repurposed 30-second commercials drive high engagement rates (views, clicks, lead requests, replays, etc.) and high brand exposure. We've also seen 100% custom video ads perform poorly on those same measures. The reasons are driven not by the length or video format but by the message: when the value proposition and the \"ask\" are clear, the video ad performs better.\nIf an advertiser wants to drive more clicks to their site, just being in video won't do it. When advertisers add promotional overlays and call to actions that give the viewer a reason to click, the likelihood of the desired action goes up dramatically. In short, online video advertising or any technology, for that matter, can't solve the problems of ill-defined communication objectives or poor creative.\nJ. Walter Thompson was THE enabler for changing the publishing world back in 1877. He executed on an idea to convince reluctant magazine publishers to diversify their revenue models from subscription and newsstand and start selling advertising in their magazines. The publishing world has never been the same.\nBut J Walter Thompson and JWT are known more for their work with Lux Soap, Maxwell House, Nestle or Ford and for pioneering the creative strategy around \"hard-sell\" advertising that focused on the \"reason-why\" approach with a clear value proposition and, often, promotion that connected with the consumer. In short, they innovated how to get the message right.\nAnd at the end of the day, effective advertising is really all about the message.\n5 comments about \"Technology Drives Change, But It's Still All About the Message\".\nSteve Pike from pikemarketing, April 6, 2009 at 7:42 p.m.\nEffective advertising may still be about the message.

{"idx": "20349", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Part of the rise is due to a genuine increase in the amount of sugar that Asians are eating (and drinking). Asian economies are growing rapidly, particularly Indonesia\u2019s, and this increasing wealth is flowing down to the general population. In addition, with the exception of China, Asia is getting younger; young people go out more, eat more processed foods and drink more sodas. All this contributes to rising consumption.\nAt the same time, sugar is cheaper than it was a couple of years back. This has a number of key effects. The first is that sugar can win back sweetener market share from fructose in food and drink production. The second is that raw sugar can replace tapioca, wheat and corn in the industrial production of MSG and lysine.\nA few years back this industrial \u201cswing\u201d was estimated at about 500,000 mt for the plants in Indonesia, South Korea, China and Thailand; we would not be surprised if that \u201cswing\u201d was not now considerably more. All this is genuine consumption that should not stop as long as sugar prices stay relatively low.\nA third effect of low prices is that the supply pipeline between \u201cmill and mouth\u201d expands. At times of high prices, pipeline participants run down stocks, partly because of the high financial cost of carrying those stocks, partly because people expect prices to fall again. During the past couple of years the pipeline has almost certainly shrunk. It is therefore possible that we, and others, have been underestimating genuine consumption growth, part of which has been fed by an invisible shrinkage in the pipeline. Now the pipeline is being rebuilt.\nUnfortunately it is impossible to say what percentage of current mill sales is actually being consumed and what is being stocked in retailers\u2019 and distributors\u2019 warehouses. This is a shame, because although we could expect genuine consumption to continue, the percentage that is going to rebuilding stocks should shut off once the pipeline is full again. That is a danger in both China and Indonesia.\nAdding to that danger is that in both those countries the pipeline has been swelled by an expansion in refining capacity. New refineries need working stocks of both raws and whites, and this means a one-off increase in raw import demand.\nIt is not just the pipeline that is being rebuilt; reserve stocks are also being rebuilt. In China, official reserve stocks have increased to around 6 million mt, and the government announced earlier that it would buy a further 1.2 million mt this crop year. This now looks unlikely, as time is running out, but some traders suggest that the quasi-state companies are also building stocks outside the official public reserve system.\nHowever the important point in China is that both imports and domestic mill sales are strong. This suggests that the sugar is really being absorbed into the domestic supply chains, a mixture of pipeline expansion and genuine consumption. We would argue that domestic prices have held up not because of government support but because sugar is \u201cdisappearing\u201d into the domestic market.\nThe test for China and for the world market will be in the current months when the 1.0 million mt plus of July/August shipments arrive. These are mostly private shipments not destined for reserve stocks. Some of that sugar will have been already hedged on the domestic futures market or presold to domestic users but some probably has not. We will need to see what happens to the Chinese domestic price when the refineries try to sell it on. If the domestic price holds then we will all have to increase our domestic consumption estimates again.\nFinally on consumption, some of the increase in Asian domestic sales may be in response to reduced smuggling, either as a result of government action or because of changing import parities.

The elementary particle does not interact with itself; typically, individual photons simply pass each other \u201clike indifferent spirits in the night,\u201d according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nWhich is why it\u2019s such a big deal that the team\u2014led by Vladan Vuletic of MIT and Mikhail Lukin from Harvard\u2014observed groups of three photons effectively sticking together to form a new kind of matter.\nWhen researchers shone a very weak laser beam through a dense cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms, instead of exiting the cloud as single, randomly space photons, the particles bound together in pairs or triplets.\nThe discovery suggests an attraction between photons. An attraction that weighs down the particles, making them more sluggish than non-interacting fragments.\nWhile photons normally have no mass and travel at the speed of light (300,000 kilometers per second), scientists found that the bound photons acquire a fraction of an electron\u2019s mass and move about 100,000 times slower.\nThis is great news for scientists, who may be able to harness photons to perform fast, complex quantum computations.\n\u201cThe interaction of individual photons has been a very long dream for decades,\u201d physics professor Vuletic said in a statement.\nIn 2013, his team at the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms observed pairs of photons interacting and binding together for the first time, creating a new state of matter.\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough, and the researchers wondered what would happen if they combined more photons.\nThe results were astounding: As three-photon particles exited the atom cloud simultaneously, their phase shifted three times more than that of two-photon molecules.\n\u201cThis means these photons are not just each of them independently interacting, but they\u2019re all together interacting strongly,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Aditya Venkatramani explained.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for Vuletic, Lukin, & Co. Moving forward, the team will look for ways to coerce other interactions, like repulsion, causing the photons to scatter like billiard balls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncharted territory,\u201d Vuletic added."}

The settlement will be paid out by the district\u2019s insurance company, and the district did not admit wrongdoing \u2014 but it did agree to follow Minnesota Government Data Practices Act requirements for future data requests.\nOn Jan. 14, board members voted unanimously to approve the deal after a discussion in closed session. In a short public session before the vote, Trevor Helmers, an attorney representing the district, said the district\u2019s insurance company recommended the settlement in hopes of avoiding a lengthier and costlier legal battle.\n\u201c[The insurance company] has done a cost-benefit analysis that says: \u2018When I look at how much time and expense is going to the defense of this litigation, if we can get rid of it early for a relatively small amount, we will,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said.\nIn the meeting, Helmers characterized Johnston\u2019s data requests as \u201cdifficult and onerous,\u201d demanding a significant amount of time from the district\u2019s administrative staff and legal team. He said the requests that prompted the court battle involved close to 300,000 pages of documents.\nJohnston, a two-term board member who has frequently challenged the district over its spending and transparency, disputed that estimate. He said the district deliberately violated state law when it failed to appropriately respond to his requests, filed in March 2018. The law requires government agencies to respond to data requests people make about themselves within 10 days, and within a \u201creasonable time\u201d for requests on other subjects.\nJohnston took the matter to the Minnesota Department of Administration, which in July issued an advisory opinion backing his claims. In the opinion, Matthew Massman, then the department\u2019s commissioner, wrote that Duluth Public Schools had \u201cnot responded appropriately\u201d to the requests. He said the district failed to notify Johnston that some of the data he requested did not exist, explain its delayed response, or provide any information about at least one of the requests.\nDistrict officials did not respond to Johnston\u2019s requests until September, a month after Johnston filed his lawsuit.\nJohnston now has the data he requested \u2014 and is set to receive the $55,000 payout from the district. He said he\u2019s pleased with the settlement, even though he had to agree to forgo any future challenges to the district over public data. That amounts to a major shift for the semiretired structural engineer, who has spent most of the past decade sparring with fellow board members and district administrators over the district\u2019s handling of major financial deals and records management.\nDistrict spokeswoman Kathleen Kaufman declined to comment, instead referring the Star Tribune to a recording of the meeting in which the school board approved the deal.\nThough he can\u2019t pursue any new legal actions involving the data he received last year from the district, Johnston said he expects the district could face more challenges.\n\u201cLots of other people can do this besides me,\u201d he said."}

They also did not eat lunch and will not eat dinner.\nThese individuals, scattered in at least six different U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities across the country, are refusing to eat as part of the #Freedomgiving hunger strike to protest what they see as their prolonged detention. They launched the strike on Nov. 25 in a protest against the U.S. government's immigration policies that have kept some of them detained for anywhere from six months to two years.\nThe group of strikers are mostly young men, over the age of 18, and are afraid of returning to their countries of origin. Many of the strikers are in detention after fleeing from persecution in their home countries in South Asia and Africa and were apprehended by officials at the border. Many of them are from Bangladesh, but there are also citizens from Ghana, Nigeria and Ethiopia, among others. About 94 of them have not eaten for nine days, according to Fahd Ahmed, executive director of Desis Rising Up and Moving, the organization that is helping the detainees coordinate the protest.\nThe numbers from DRUM differ from ICE's counts. According to an ICE official, there are 109 individuals on a hunger strike in six facilities across the country as of Thursday evening. ICE counts only individuals who have not eaten for more than 72 hours or nine meals.\nThese individuals have abstained from food, but not water, according to the ICE official.\n\"Most of the people who have begun the hunger strike began it, because they had no other recourse,\" said Paromita Shah, the Associate Director at the National Immigration Project, who has been working with DRUM and the strikers.\nICE said it is monitoring the situation. \"ICE takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation,\" said Jennifer Elzea, deputy press secretary at ICE.\nThe strikers are demanding an end to all detentions and deportations, an end to indefinite detention and improved conditions in detention (legal access, discipline, food, clothing, access to phones, medical access), among others, said Ahmed.\nICE declined to comment on the specific demands that the detainees have made.\nMany of the strikers are in the defensive asylum process, meaning they are fighting against removal proceedings from the U.S. They are fleeing from circumstances like those of other asylum seekers and refugees. Mohammed Zakir Hosain, one of the men who participated in an earlier hunger strike in November in California, told the Los Angeles Times that he came to the United States because he was regularly beaten up by members of a different political party in Bangladesh because he had belonged to an opposition party.\nHe, like many of the others who have since participated in a hunger strike, came to the United States after initially flying to South America and then making their arduous way north.\nPeople like Hosain are then detained by the border patrol at the U.S. border with Mexico.

It moves at an expertly controlled cortege tempo and is almost swooningly overwhelmed by its own historical importance. This is a portrait of Jackie Kennedy, well and conscientiously played by Natalie Portman; it imagines her stunned, stricken existence in the days between President Kennedy\u2019s brutal assassination and his state funeral: a period that the film sets out to evoke almost moment by moment, with wordless lonely scenes in corridors, looming closeups on faces, amplified conspiratorial whispers, poignant memories of banal happier times. Mica Levi\u2019s orchestral score, with a creamy dissonance of strings, does a lot of work in suggesting both elegiac sadness and post-traumatic stress disorder. The director is Chilean film-maker Pablo Larra\u00edn, with his first English-language film.\nThis was a time in which Mrs Kennedy had to battle for her personal right to participate in the commemoration and the mourning, and felt crowded out by the self-important boys\u2019 club made up of the Kennedy menfolk and Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s incoming team. In particular, she resented the suggestion that she should not walk openly beside the coffin. There were security considerations \u2013 the unthinkable horror of a second assassination \u2013 but she resented being airbrushed out of history.\nNatalie Portman\u2019s performance is careful and intelligent, groomed and coiffed and vocalised: Jackie\u2019s patrician graciousness co-existing with clenched anxiety and a sprinkling of entitlement and peppery hauteur. There is the occasional weird Monroe-type breathiness in the voice.

US forces on hand were insufficient to guard all vulnerable locations in the city. They fought a three-day battle with regime fighters next to the National Museum while looters were pillaging it.\nThe picture of what actually happened at the museum remains murky. One thing is clear: Hussein's regime itself was looting it and other cultural sites all through the 1990s. Many of the more-recent thefts may have been the work of professionals - maybe even an inside job by someone who had the keys. Thieves stole precious originals, like the Harp of Ur and the Vase of Uruk, leaving replicas behind.\nBut it's time to focus on recovery, not blame.

{"idx": "20377", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Alarm bells are sounding for the mining industry over growing government control of resources in Sub-Saharan Africa, as states try to cash in on higher commodity prices and secure votes ahead of elections.\nThis phenomenon \u2014 dubbed resource nationalism \u2014 is unlike outright nationalisation seen in the 1960s and 1970s when governments took full control of mines. Instead it takes various forms, including higher royalties and taxes imposed by states on companies, and the introduction or increase of compulsory minimum quotas for ownership. An emphasis is also placed on aspects such as local beneficiation and procurement of local goods and services.\nIt has taken hold in Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and even SA, according to Peter Leon, partner and Africa cochair at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, who presented at the International Bar Association Annual Conference in Rome from October 7-12.\nIt is a concern for mining investors who are easily spooked when rules change in the middle of long-term investments.\nWhile some examples are more extreme than others, \u201cthe general trend is undoubtedly in the direction of greater fiscal control and greater state intervention\u201d, Leon says.\nThe Tanzanian government in 2017 claimed an \u201ceconomic war\u201d between itself and mining companies and passed various laws that, among other things, raised royalties and imposed compulsory government equity stakes in operations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in 2018, the government signed a new mining code into law that introduces a range of changes expected to negatively affect major companies invested there, including JSE-listed Glencore and London-based Randgold Resources.\nIn SA, the newly gazetted Mining Charter is an example of resource nationalism, although to a lesser degree than Tanzania and DRC, Leon said. The third version of the charter raises minimum quotas on certain aspects for mines, including black ownership.\nResource nationalism is influenced by certain cycles specific to each jurisdiction, with the first and most fundamental being the investment cycle. \u201cIt only manifests after significant investments have already been made and have started yielding returns. Any earlier would avert investors from making the front-loaded capital outlays necessary for prospecting and mining,\u201d Leon says.\nA more immediate driver is the commodity cycle in states that are highly dependent on raw mineral exports.\nLeon observes that when prices begin to experience a sustained upward trend, the perception is that foreign investors make a larger profit. There may also be a sense, owing to low tax and royalty rates, that the state is not fully maximising the benefits of this windfall in the price of the nation\u2019s natural resource, Leon says.\nAttitudes have also hardened after an AU African Union report showed that, from 2000 to 2010, African states lost at least $50bn a year owing to \u2018illicit financial flows\u2019, 56% of which came from the oil, gas and mining sectors.\nAnother immediate driver is the electoral cycle, especially in countries where regular elections have close winning margins. \u201cIncumbent governments may seek to increase their electoral support by exploiting the populist appeal of resource nationalism\u201d, Leon says.\nUnderlying it all is a sentiment that African mining countries did not derive proportionate benefits from the last commodities boom, when multinational mining companies appeared to make windfall profits, says Leon.

Climate-smart farmers who are able to take out loans are then able to invest in ever more sustainable production tools and methods to help them mitigate climatic shocks.\nElsewhere, Kenyan agribusiness, UjuziKilimo, uses wireless sensor networks to monitor soils and provide advice on fertilizers, seeds, weather and best practices to help smallholders farm with greater precision, according to local conditions and climate.\nAnd Hello Tractor, a Nigerian start-up, provides farmers with smart tractors, equipped with GPS and telematic technology, which enables data collection on the farm's location and size, and planting and harvesting times.\nThis data, combined with other information on weather conditions and soil type, can serve as an early warning system for environmental changes to allow farmers to respond swiftly and reduce the risk of crop losses.\nSome of these innovations are among those to have emerged through CTA's Agri-Hack Talent initiative, which encourages young people to harness the power of mobile phones, social media and web-based platforms to reboot agriculture.\nDrones are another example of a new technology that is increasingly becoming a valuable tool for farmers, helping them monitor their crops for diseases and pests that are spreading in unexpected ways because of climate change.\nCTA's Eyes in the Sky project provides crop inventory and crop management advice to smallholder farmers that helps them offset the risks of an increasingly unpredictable climate.\nConnecting farmers to such expert advice has helped them to calculate yields as well as their fertiliser and seed requirements.\nAnd by creating digitalised profiles of more than 4,000 smallholder farmers, which map the location, size and"}

I said well, 'Let's talk about it.'\"\nIt took two years of discussion to agree that heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions attributable to human activity are driving today's climate change.\nThe marital episode and her subsequent engagement with faith groups have firmed up her views that the traditional conservative tenet of small government - not science - usually explains why some resist the issue.\n\"(It's) not because they really have a problem with the science,\" she said. \"It's because they have a problem with the perceived solutions.\"\n\"Taxes, government legislation, loss of personal liberty ... that's the real problem people have.\"\nHayhoe did not field any questions from climate change skeptics during her talk at the summit in Edmonton.

Some were finishing their summiting of the 46 highest mountains in the Adirondacks and some were falling in love with the High Peaks for the first time.\nAfter a dry and warm summer where picture after picture was posted to social media from popular summits such as Cascade Mountain, heavily used trails like Cascade\u2019s were battered one last time before autumn cleaning. Adirondack Mountain Club summit stewards said they spoke to more than 1,500 hikers on Cascade alone over Labor Day weekend.\nADK Executive Director Neil Woodworth didn\u2019t mince words when describing the amount of people hammering the High Peaks, as he said it was too much to handle. Julia Goren, ADK\u2019s Summit Steward coordinator, was even more direct.\nThe stories from busy weekends such as Labor Day weekend suggest the Adirondack High Peaks are at a critical juncture. On most every summer weekend this year, hundreds of cars were parked along miles of roadside throughout the Lake Placid and Keene area. Parking lots at The Garden in Keene Valley and the High Peaks Information Center were jampacked before the sun rose. And at the end of the trails these droves of people signed into, enormous parties of hikers crowded the state\u2019s highest summits.\nPossibly the largest group was organized on August 25 through a post on the online social networking portal Meetup.com by a Montreal man. Two days later, the state Department of Environmental Conservation ticketed the group\u2019s leaders after they led 67 people to the top of Algonquin Peak.\nThrough it all, wilderness leaders across the state expressed concern about the amount of people not practicing proper Leave No Trace principles.\nBoth the numbers at the DEC\u2019s trail registers and the numbers online bear out this latest, and largest, explosion the Adirondacks has seen.\nGoren said six ADK summit stewards were on duty Labor Day weekend, atop Mount Marcy, Algonquin Peak, Wright Peak and Cascade. They counted talking to more than 3,000 people.\nDEC statistics cited by the Adirondack Explorer magazine showed Cascade trailhead registrations more than doubled over the past decade, from 16,091 in 2006 to 33,149 in 2015 \u2014 and mostly in the last five years.

However, the CDC says, a cluster of whooping cough cases from the winter before likely was a true outbreak.\nThe pseudo-outbreak does not diminish the importance of the \"real\" cases of whooping cough that continue to crop up each year, said lead researcher Sema Mandal of the CDC.\n\"We&apos;ve had strong evidence of other outbreaks,\" Mandal told Reuters Health, citing a 2010 outbreak in California as an example.\nWhooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection that causes uncontrollable, severe coughing. Worldwide, it infects between 30 million and 50 million people a year, and kills about 300,000 -- mostly children in the developing world.\nIn the U.S., most children are immunized against whooping cough with the DTaP vaccine, which is given as a series of shots starting at the age of 2 months.\nBut cases still occur. According to the CDC, 27,550 cases were reported nationwide in 2010, with many more probably going unreported. There were also 27 deaths, nearly all in infants younger than one year.\nCalifornia saw an outbreak of more than 9,000 cases, including 10 infant deaths, that year.\nBut in the Colorado outbreak, researchers suspected something was amiss.\nBetween November 2008 and September 2009, 125 cases of whooping cough were reported in the southwestern part of the state, mostly in children.\nBut in many cases, patients did not have classic symptoms -- like the distinctive \"whoop\" sound that&apos;s heard when people try to inhale during a coughing attack.\nMany of the suspected infections were also in people who&apos;d been vaccinated.\nWhen the CDC investigated, it found differences between the cluster of \"winter\" cases that were diagnosed through April, and the \"summer\" cluster diagnosed from May through August.\nWhile nearly all people diagnosed in the winter had classic whooping cough symptoms, only 63 percent of the summer cluster did. And people diagnosed in the summer were more likely to have only small amounts of pertussis DNA in their test samples -- which suggested the samples may have been contaminated.\nIndeed, the CDC found pertussis DNA on surfaces at the clinic where most of the cases were seen. Of the sites the team swabbed -- from nurses&apos; laptops to sinks to glove containers -- 61 percent had detectable pertussis DNA.\nThe researchers suspect that pertussis DNA from vaccines contaminated clinic surfaces, and then contaminated samples taken from patients to be sent to out for testing.\nOn top of that, Mandal pointed out, after the true winter outbreak, doctors were on heightened alert for whooping cough, which means they may have been testing more people than necessary. And that alone raises the odds of mistaken diagnoses.\nPertussis pseudo-outbreaks have been reported a few times before, for instance, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Tennessee between 2004 and 2006.\nIn response, the CDC has published \"best"}

The almost two hour-long session touched on 'the importance of writing contests for aspiring and emerging authors'.\nProf Sigauke focused on the English short story which he said was one of his earliest judging assignments back in 1996 at the Budding Writers Association of Zimbabwe (BWAZ). He urged authors to participate in writing contests and said winning a prize boosts a writer's productivity and exposes their work to publishers and readers.\nHaving been involved in different stages of the short story competition such as mentoring, screening submissions, judging, editing and publishing, Prof Sigauke encouraged the new writers 'to make occasional searches for contests that they can participate in, particularly those serving African writers such as Writivism and Short Story Day Africa'.\n\"Besides challenging yourself, participating in contests helps with an awareness of what the market is looking for. Some contests are driven by specific themes or issues,\" he said.\nIt is common that new writers take submission rules for granted and you find stories with impressive plots losing prizes simply because of a shoddy copy or wrong formatting.\n\"The organisers are often clear on how the manuscript must be formatted. Many writers, because they are in a hurry to submit the work or because of impatience with such instructions, will turn in sloppy, unprofessional work. Such entries will not be taken seriously,\" said the Professor.\nProf Sigauke added that not all competitions are created equal though.\n\"There are many categories to consider but it is important to locate competitions for various reasons such as ease of submission. It is important sometimes to focus on more local contests even though they may not give a lot in terms of prize money,\" he said.\nThe session also discussed \"free entries\" versus \"paid submissions\". Prof Sigauke told the new writers that some are benefiting from contests that do not require submission fees but he said most American writing contests require a non-refundable submission fee of between $10 and $25 per story.\nHowever, Prof Sigauke defended the payment of submission fees, saying most contests are run by nonprofit organisations or small presses which require entry fees to cover costs such as paying the judge, building the prize money and other costs.\nThe good part of the Whatsapp lecture was when the writers engaged the Professor with their various concerns which included how to guard against vanity publishers and copyright loss in some of these contests.\nIn terms of copyright, Prof Sigauke said often these contests lead to the publication of the top entries and at that point the writers will be made aware of the conditions of publication.\n\"There are predators and scammers out there but legitimate contests are easy to verify too. Most are announced in reputable magazines like 'Poets and Writers'\", said Prof Sigauke.\nMeanwhile, the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) is now getting ready to hold this year's edition of the book fair next month under the theme \"The Book: Creating the Future!\"\nThe ZIBF office in Harare has said the book fair will be running from September 24 to 29, starting with the two-day Indaba Conference at the Monomotapa Hotel. ZIBF is also expected to hold its provincial book fair under the same theme in Mutare in October.\nAnd perhaps the Harare book fair will provide a chance to meet an author whom we have not known yet he lives in Zimbabwe"}

Land of the free and the home of the imprisoned?\nU.S. Rep. Hank Johnson says the United States puts a lot of people in prison.\n\"Mister Speaker, the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world,\" the liberal Democrat from DeKalb County said one day in the House of Representatives. \"We currently incarcerate 2.3 million people. The incarceration rate is not fitting for a nation which is routinely touted as the greatest nation in the world.\"\nPolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Johnson was correct about his claim that America has more people in its prisons than any other country. Or should the congressman go into our fact-checking holding cell?\nJohnson\u2019s main reason for the statement was a verbal volley at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which he accused of lobbying for harsher prison sentences that benefit some members that run for-profit jails. Johnson\u2019s office posted a video of his speech on YouTube.\nThe congressman\u2019s office sent us several news articles and reports to fortify his claim. The news coverage all said the United States led the world in prison incarceration. The coverage was based on data from the International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain. The center consistently tracks prison populations worldwide, and its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters.\nThe most recent study, using data as of May 2011, found there were nearly 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons, the same number Johnson used in his congressional floor speech. A 2010 congressional report said 2.3 million Americans were in prison. The report was based on 2008 data.\nIn the most recent World Prison Population List, the U.S. had more prisoners than any other country. China was second with 1.65 million people in prison, but the report said it does not include people in pre-trial detention or \"administrative detention.\" Russia was a distant third, with about 806,000 people in prison.\nThe center also measured the numbers by the percentage of people in prison. The report estimated the U.S. population at 308.4 million. It concluded that 743 of every 100,000 Americans were in prison. Again, the U.S. was first on the list.\nRwanda and Russia were second and third, respectively, with 595 and 568 people in prison per 100,000 citizens.\nThe congressional report shows the U.S. prison population was about 100 per 100,000 between the 1920s and the late 1970s. Afterward, it went up like a rocket. One turning point, the report said, was New York state\u2019s 1973 imposition of mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenses under the administration of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Other states followed. Georgia ranked eighth nationally in the number of prisoners in that 2010 report, with 540 per 100,000. Louisiana was first, and eight of the top 10 states are in the South.\nThe World Prison Population List includes totalitarian regimes and"}

The state is New York, and the style \u2014 ice wine \u2014 results in mere drops of liquid per year, relative to traditional table wines nationwide.\nThe grapes used to make this pour rely on arctic weather to bring out their sweet, summery flavors, which means that California, the nation\u2019s wine behemoth, has little chance of catching this East Coast contender in a race. Not that California is even trying \u2014 it can\u2019t. The production of ice wine is more of a waiting game, and the winners come in last.\nThese decadent nectars send forth heady aromas of apricots, peaches, pears, tropical fruits and honey so distinct that you sometimes don\u2019t even need to stick your nose down into a glass to smell them. The flavors are just as expressive, with beautiful streaks of balancing acidity. New York ice wines pair well with fruit desserts and cheese, from hard and aged to tangy and blue. The wines can also be enjoyed with savory dishes, like seared foie gras, various pates, salty cured meats and foods with spicy heat. Serve these wines well chilled, as the name suggests.\nA small amount of New York ice wine is produced in the Niagara Escarpment AVA (American Viticultural Area) on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, west of Rochester and north of Buffalo. But most New York ice wine comes from the Finger Lakes region, southeast of Rochester, where the state\u2019s first ice wine was made in 1981.\nThe grapes \u2014 often riesling and the French-American hybrids vidal and vignoles \u2014 grow alongside other grapes meant for the state\u2019s table wines, so it\u2019s not as if ice wine grapes are cast off to a northerly, year-round tundra. These grapes need a full growing season of sunshine to properly ripen, just like any other wine grape. When those other grapes have been harvested, ice wine grapes are left to shiver and struggle through the harshest weather the year has to offer. All in the name of sensual pleasure.\nThis is not late-harvest wine made from grapes affected by Botrytis cinerea (aka \u201cnoble rot\u201d). Ice wine grapes are harvested and pressed when frozen. Allowing the grapes to freeze essentially traps water, concentrating the grape\u2019s sugar and acidity, guaranteeing that the extracted syrupy juice will be extra sweet. In the vineyard, the colder the better. Lower temperatures translate to more-concentrated sugar and more-expressive wine.\nA mild winter can be disastrous for an ice wine producer \u2014 the grapes can rot and fall to the ground before freezing \u2014 so winemakers cross their fingers as the growing season comes to its natural end. In Canada and in Germany, the birthplace of this wine style (called \u201cicewine\u201d in Canada, \u201cEiswein\u201d in Germany), laws dictate a required temperature for an ice wine harvest. There is no temperature law in the United States, but ice wines are protected and must be made from grapes that froze on the vine. An alternative version of this wine style can be made from grapes that are manually frozen after harvest, called \u201ciced wines.\u201d While they can be enjoyable, they are less-expressive than true ice wines.

{"idx": "20405", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Any trip to the Big Island in Hawaii offers up an amazing array of recreational opportunities, but one of the best ways to combine a little history with some of Hawaii's natural wonders is to visit the Captain Cook Monument.\nLocated on the western shore of the Big Island, the monument has attracted visitors from around the world for several reasons, not the least of which is the adventure just getting to the historical site. From a wonderful hike on the Captain Cook Monument Trail to snorkeling in Kealakekua Bay, a visit to the Captain Cook Monument in the state's historical park is a day-long adventure you won't soon forget.\nThe Captain Cook Monument was erected by the British in homage to Captain James Cook, who's widely believed to have been the first westerner to lay eyes on Hawaii when he sailed there on January 12, 1778. Cook's first arrival on Big Island, which is also known as the island of Hawai'i, was met with great fanfare as the indigenous locals were in the midst of their annual Makahiki Festival, which honors their fertility god Lono. Because of the sudden and strange appearance of these white foreigners during the celebration, the Hawaiians believed that Cook was Lono himself, so they welcomed him with a feast and gifts.\nAfter, Cook and his crew left the island on February 4, only to return a week later, to a much chillier reception. Having figured out that Cook was not the fertility god Lono, the islanders were more hostile and Cook was killed, along with four crew members.\nNearly 100 years later, the British erected a 27-foot-tall obelisk in 1874 to mark the location of Cook's arrival in Hawaii and his death near the same spot. As an interesting side note, the Monument itself is surrounded by a chain attached to cannon balls and the area inside the chain is owned by the British, making it the only British territory within the the borders of the United States.\nIf you like a little overland adventure, the Captain Cook Monument Trail, which is also called the Ka'Awaloa Trail, is a moderate 3.6 mile hike that rewards those on foot with spectacular views of Kealakekua Bay on the way down.\nThe start of the trail leading to the Captain Cook Monument is located 12 miles south of Kailua-Kona, one of the main enclaves on the Big Island's western side. To get to Captain Cook Monument from Kona and the Kohala Coast, follow the Hawaii Belt Road (Highway 11) past Kailua Kona, then turn off onto Napo'opo'o Road. The trailhead is about 50 yards from the turn-off and parking is available along the side of the road.\nFrom Hilo, take the Saddle Road over the island between the peaks of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa until it intersects with the Hawaii Belt Road. An alternative route for those traveling from Hilo, as well as for travelers coming from the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Area, is to take the Hawaii Belt Road south and west around the bottom of the island. From this direction, the turn down to the bay will be on your left just before you enter the small village of Captain Cook.\nFrom the head of the trail, you descend 1.8 miles to the bay through large rocks and tree-filled areas that offer ample shade on hot days. The first mile of the Captain Cook Trail is lined with tall grass, until shrubs, bushes and small trees begin to line"}

Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., dominated sales with about 80 percent market share until last year. Advanced Micro came back with newer chips and won over customers, and Intel ended 2006 with its share at an 11-year low.\nIntel will have two months to respond to the charges, and a final decision can be appealed in European courts. Under European Union rules, companies can be fined up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaking antitrust rules.\nThe commission\u2019s biggest antitrust fine was a penalty of 497 million euros (about $600 million at the time) against Microsoft in 2004 for abusing its dominant position in PC operating systems.\nChuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, declined to comment. An Advanced Micro spokesman, Drew Prairie, said the company had not heard directly from the European Union and would not comment until it did.\nAdvanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has claimed that Intel maintained its share of the $33 billion market for microprocessors by \u201cengaging in a relentless, worldwide campaign to coerce customers to refrain from dealing with A.M.D.,\u201d it said in a lawsuit filed in June 2005 in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del. The case is still pending.\nThe action would be the first time that the competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, has formally charged a company with abuse of a dominant market position.

I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it?\nNational Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26. I had a chance to watch one of the episodes at a screener last month - it was fine and very wide-eyed. There were lots of shots of Earth from space. It was very pretty. But I guess I've been concerned about Nat Geo ever since Fox bought them back in 2015 - and this bottle makes me question whether they're turning into a high-budget Goop.\nThe huge box Nat Geo sent me contained a book, some press material, and this glass water bottle with their name printed on the side. The $9) bottle's package advertises that it contains \"carefully selected and ethically sourced gemstones representing the building blocks of earth,\" including \"wood,\" \"water,\" \"earth,\" \"metal\" and \"fire.\" It came with an instruction and information manual.\nWhy does my water bottle have an instruction manual? It reads: \"For the most precious moments in life! Gems raise the energy level of water. That's been known for hundreds of years and scientifically proven. VitaJuwel Gemwater Accessories are not only Jewellery for Water, they're a great tool to prepare heavenly gemwater like fresh from the spring.\" The instructions are: screw in the gemstone vial, fill with water, and then wait 7 minutes.\nHere's the thing - this is a water bottle containing a sealed jar of gemstones. At no point will the water even come into contact with any of said gemstones. A warning tells you to discard the bottle if there is any way for water to seep into the vial of gems. All of the \"science\" cited in the brochure comes from widely debunked research from the likes of Japanese author Masaru Emoto - you know, the researcher who claimed humans could impact the chemical structure of water with their thoughts - or unnamed \"German scientists.\"\nNational Geographic, why did you send this ridiculous thing to me????? One press officer representing the new TV show (who I feel bad for) agreed that the bottle was definitely pseudoscientific, and suggested that maybe Nat Geo was \"aiming to be symbolic.\" Nat Geo has not yet responded to request for comment at the time of publishing, but I'll update when I hear back.\nGems are common in pseudoscience, you may be familiar with crystal healing from Gwyneth Paltrow's trainwreck of a pseudoscience blog, Goop. Please don't make me worry that people should align National Geographic with these folks. I already feel like the world has turned its back on science with the anti-vaxxer movement running unchecked, Goop selling \"bio-frequency-healing stickers,\" the EPA seemingly doing whatever it can to ruin the environment, and pseudoscience-peddling websites like InfoWars garnering any readers at all.\nHey, maybe this is a joke, meant to rile journalists up. Or maybe it really is symbolic, or an oversight.

Below, a quick guide as to why 2018 is going to be one of those years that sticks in Quebecers\u2019 memories.\nAlthough they have way slicker branding than the usual Canadian Tories, Coalition Avenir Quebec ticks most of the boxes for a Canadian conservative party: Tax cuts, increased privatization and an end to Quebec dependence on equalization payments. An actual named conservative party hasn\u2019t won seats in Quebec since 1935, but the province\u2019s last right wing government was under the Union Nationale, the political machine famously headed by Quebec strongman Maurice Duplessis. Essentially, CAQ is the first conservative party to win power in a Quebec where it\u2019s common to see churches turned into condominiums.\nAccording to disclosures made last month, CAQ leader Francois Legault is worth $10 million. Although he spent the early 2000s as a Parti Quebecois MNA, Legault has an extensive business background that includes co-founding Air Transat in 1987. Unlike the United States, it\u2019s somewhat rare that Canadians elect millionaires to lead them. But Legault\u2019s wealth is still dwarfed by that of former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams. Nicknamed Danny Millions, he was head of Cable Atlantic before selling it to Rogers for $282 million in 2000.\nThere are cats older than the CAQ. The party was founded in 2011, and last night was only the third time they had ever contested an election. Naturally, this kind of \u201covernight\u201d success is exceedingly rare: It would be like Preston Manning founding the Reform Party in 1987 and ascending to the prime minister\u2019s office by 1994. But the last time a new party ever swept to power quicker than the CAQ was in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan NDP was founded in 1967 as a rebrand of the old CCF. By 1971 the new party was in majority control of the Wheat Province.\nWith only 29 seats, the Quebec Liberal Party hasn\u2019t occupied such a small share of the Quebec National Assembly since they were blown out by Rene Levesque\u2019s Parti Quebecois in 1976. But in terms of overall vote share, the Quebec Liberal Party has never had a worse showing in 151 years. The 2018 election is the first time in history that fewer than 30 per cent of Quebec voters marked a ballot for the Grits.\nThe Parti Quebecois only won nine seats; not even enough to hold onto official party status. It was fewer seats even than the 10 won by Quebec Solidaire, a newer separatist party that advocates calving off La Belle Province so that they can turn it into a socialist Naomi Klein utopia. In total, there will only be 19 people in the Quebec National Assembly representing parties that do not want the province to be part of Canada. This is the worst showing of separatists since 1973, when the newly founded Parti Quebecois was still finding its feet in the aftermath of the Quiet Revolution. Of course, a lot of this is due to vote splitting. Taken together, the Quebec Solidaire/Parti Quebecois vote share was still about 33 per cent \u2014 about the same as what former Parti Quebecois leader Pauline Marois needed to head"}

Investors hoping to do more with their money, but who might not be able to afford the hefty fees that come with financial advice from a human, have turned to companies like Betterment, Wealthfront, and FutureAdvisor for help. The startups pride themselves in providing a clean mobile experience paired with automated investing for the more tech-savvy millennial investors gravitating to their services.\nBetterment is hoping to accomplish the same thing with its latest venture: Betterment for Business, which is set to be available early next year. The new service will provide companies with a robo-driven alternative to other 401(k) providers, including a similar clean interface for both employers and employees. If it works, Betterment's 401(k) bot may help add financial adviser to the list of human jobs soon to be co-opted by smarter machines.\nFor Betterment, the idea for the new service came from the company\u2019s own challenging search process to find a 401(k) provider for its employees, says founder and CEO Jon Stein. After combing through a number of options, Betterment settled on what they believed was the best option they could find. And, even so, Stein says it was a \"disaster.\"\nBetterment believes that its emphasis on tech and user experience will make it a desirable choice for employers and employees. On the employer side, companies will be able to see a dashboard that allows them to check in on the company\u2019s accounts; enroll new employees; and offer any assistance\u2014all online. Stein says that it is also offering its service with lower fees than its older competitors.\nFor participating employees, Betterment says that, unlike its competitors, users will be able to get personalized advice thanks to its automated system. If a user has a company-sponsored 401(k) on Betterment as well as other individual accounts with the company, the automated service will make decisions based on all of the assets combined.\n\"You can tell us more about yourself so we can further customize a plan for you,\" Stein says, meaning that the plan can also take into account social security benefits, other investments, as well as your personal goals.\nWhile the success of Betterment for Business remains to be seen, the company is intent on pushing its expansion into a space traditionally dominated by financial services institutions like Fidelity, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab.\nBut businesses tasked with choosing company-sponsored 401(k)s will still have to reckon with how willing they are to put their employees' retirements in the hands of a robot. Even if Betterment offers a cheaper alternative or snazzy interface, companies will have to decide if they really want to put their long-term stake in something new."}

{"idx": "20416", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: HANOVER, N.J. \u2014 More than the sound of Cessnas and private jets at Morristown Municipal Airport this week was the buzz over the impending arrival of President Trump, who would be flying in for another weekend stay at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., where he spends time in the summer.\nAirport regulars \u2014 from flight instructors to mechanics to amateur pilots \u2014 said they expected the usual lockdown of the runway during the president\u2019s arrival and departure, and flying restrictions for the full duration of his stay.\nWhile it may not compare to the larger controversies of the Trump presidency, the president\u2019s visits to Bedminster have upset the aviation world in New Jersey, one of the busiest clusters of local airports in the country.\nEach time the president visits Bedminster, the federal authorities implement temporary flight restrictions, or T.F.R.s, which create a no-fly zone within a 10-mile radius of the golf course during his stay.\nThe restrictions ground flights at the two privately owned Solberg and Somerset Airports closest to the golf course. Looser regulations restrict air traffic within a 30-mile radius, affecting nearly 20 more airports and the dozens of related businesses and aeronautical services from aircraft parking and rentals to flight training, fuel sales and maintenance.\nWith the visits coming in the summertime \u2014 peak season for small airports \u2014 the restrictions have crippled aviation businesses and may force some to fold unless changes are made, airport owners said, adding that the federal authorities have been unwilling to work with them and ease some restrictions choking their businesses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been devastating,\u201d said Bill Fritsche, who said he was facing tens of thousands of dollars in lost fuel sales and other business at the 100-plane Alexandria Field Airport that he co-owns in Pittstown, N.J., a roughly 13-mile flight from the golf club.\nHis airport is one of about 20 within a 30-mile radius. Pilots may use the runways at the smaller airports, but they must employ an extra level of communication with air traffic controllers. They must also file a flight plan for each trip, proceed directly out of the restricted area without lingering, and may not conduct flight training there.\nChuck Owen, co-owner of Skydive Jersey, based at Alexandria Field, said his sky diving charters have been greatly reduced by the flight restrictions banning sky diving or balloon flights within the 30-mile radius.\nGoing into last summer, he said, he was handling 140 customers per day during weekends with the help of a 14-seat plane. Since the presidential restrictions last summer, his company has defaulted on the plane\u2019s lease.\nHe said he and Mr. Fritsche presented a lengthy report last year to the Secret Service, claiming the sky diving operation posed no security threat and offering various measures, including vetting pilots and instructors. Secret Service officials declined.\nA Federal Aviation Administration spokesman referred questions to the Secret Service.\nShawn L. Holtzclaw, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said in a statement that, \u201cIn collaboration with the F.A.A. and other partners, the Secret Service structures temporary flight restrictions to provide a balance between commercial aviation, general aviation, public access and security.\nFlight restrictions at smaller airports involves no real partisan bickering, since flight restrictions have been implemented wherever presidents fly.\nPresidential visits affected restrictions for roughly 40 days last summer, Mr. Steinberg said.

The studio did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment about whether it planned to submit the film in any of the Oscar categories.\nThe film took in $2.2 million domestically from its first late-night screenings, setting it up for a strong shot at a No. 1 debut weekend. It is already well on its way to becoming a top-grossing music documentary.\nOrtega, a veteran director, producer and choreographer who counts TV\ufffds \ufffdHigh School Musical\ufffd among his credits, could find himself in contention for a best-director nod, Gaydos said.\nAfter completing a weeklong run, \ufffdThis Is It\ufffd could also be eligible for Golden Globe awards consideration if it\ufffds submitted before the Nov. 6 deadline, said Michael Russell, a spokesman for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts on the annual ceremony.\nOrtega said an Oscar nod would be a fitting recognition of Jackson\ufffds last work."}
{"idx": "20419", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: These developments affect the entire breadth of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation \u2013 from small arms and light weapons to weapons of mass destruction. These not only create challenges, but also provide opportunities to think about how to revitalize what is, frankly, an increasingly besieged regime.\nAs Secretary-General [Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres told the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva less than one month ago [25 February 2019], we need a new vision for arms control in today\u2019s complex security environment, while taking care to preserve the hard-won gains of yesterday.\nIn May last year , the Secretary-General released his Agenda for Disarmament, Securing Our Common Future. He was compelled to embark on this initiative for a number of reasons. Two of those are of direct relevance to this conference.\nFirst, in the face of a manifest deterioration in great power relations on matters of international peace and security coupled with a severe erosion of trust, the key multilateral disarmament bodies remain hamstrung. Moreover, key States seem disinterested in pursuing or even preserving the arms control and disarmament infrastructure that has been indispensable to global security.\nSecond, the design and acquisition of new weapon technologies with unclear and potentially dangerous applications is outpacing our normative efforts for their control and regulation. This trend is aptly demonstrated by the four sectoral areas highlighted by this conference, each of which are covered in the disarmament agenda, as I will briefly outline.\nMalicious acts in cyberspace, exacerbated by our growing dependence on that realm, are undermining trust between States. Critical infrastructure that is connected through cyber technologies, ranging from the financial sector to power grids to nuclear facilities, make for potentially vulnerable targets. Moreover, the political and technical difficulty of attributing and assigning responsibility for cyberattacks could result in significant consequences, including unintended escalation.\nOur excitement at the astounding advances in biotechnology over recent years are tempered by grave concerns at their clear potential for misuse. Previous barriers to the acquisition of biological weapons are being eroded by advances such as genome editing. Such techniques can moreover modify biological agents in ways that would enhance their utility as weapons.\nDevelopments in artificial intelligence research are driving interest in autonomy in weapons and other military applications. The possible implications are vast and still not well understood.\nIncreasing autonomy in the critical functions of weapons systems raises serious questions for existing legal frameworks and how to ensure human accountability for the use of force. And there are profound ethical questions about outsourcing life and death decisions to algorithms.\nOperationally, the growing military adoption of AI technologies is bound to increase the speed of decision-making and action in conflict, with concomitant challenges for escalation control.\nLikewise, new missile technologies such as hypersonic boost-glide systems promise to shorten reaction times. The pursuit of these weapons has taken on an unsettling arms- racing character that is problematic for international peace and security and is undermining prospects for much needed strategic arms reduction agreements to succeed New Start.\nAnd unlike the other areas of technology under discussion at this conference, there is no United Nations process for considering hypersonic weapons, or the problem of missiles more broadly.\nThat is why my office, together with the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research recently published a study on hypersonic weapons. The study makes the case for multilateral discussion of hypersonic weapons, the development of which cannot be seen in isolation from the current deterioration in strategic arms control. I hope this possibility can be further discussed by the relevant panel later today."}

Some markets are now back to where they were before Congress approved the $700 billion financial rescue in October.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 445 points, or 5.6 percent.

The price of Citigroup\u2019s shares plunged 26.4 percent on Thursday and other financial shares fell to fresh lows.\nCitigroup, which is under pressure from some investors to split itself or sell businesses, plans to hold a meeting on Friday to update executives on the company\u2019s condition.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 6.7 percent, leaving that benchmark down about 52 percent from its peak in October 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,552.29, barely above its low in October 2002 during the depths of the last bear market. The Nasdaq fell 5 percent, to 1,316.12.\nThe fear was reflected in a stampede for the safety of government securities. The Treasury\u2019s benchmark 10-year bill rose 2- 22/32, to 106- 10/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.01 percent, down from 3.32 percent late Wednesday.\nThe sell-off in equities gathered force over the last several days and brought an abrupt end to what had been a modest improvement in financial markets.

The library had sought $1,259,940 but was asked several weeks ago to trim the request.\nThe new tax rate will be about 27 cents per $100 assessed valuation, up about 3 cents, officials said Tuesday.\nThe arguments lauding the library were various, eloquent and numerous.\nIn making a case for more money, library board President Mary McKean, her board and Marilyn Boria, administrative librarian, cited a deteriorating building, a depleted surplus, higher use of the library and increased costs.\nEven Ald. William Jones III called it ''a fabulous facility'' before voting against the library`s request.\nIn an earlier meeting, Southcombe had proposed that any increase should be authorized in a referendum, but McKean rejected that.\nThe library board is appointed by the mayor but controls its spending.

He also accused Western nations of fueling a massive exodus of Syrians that, added to migrants fleeing other Asian and African countries, has created the largest crisis in Europe since World War II.\nAssad said the Russian air campaign could succeed because it is supported by Iran and has international, if not Western, support.\nHe said the Russian intervention is open-ended and was coordinated with the Syrian military.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that it struck Islamic State command posts, training camps and ammunition depots, flying 20 sorties in a single day.\nStill, most of the sites listed in the Russian attacks are in central and western Syria, while the Islamic State largely occupies eastern portions of the country.

{"idx": "20446", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A recent landmark transfer pricing ruling, pronounced on 2 November 2007 by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, reaffirmed the principle that transfer pricing is not an exact science in which mathematical certainty is possible and that some approximations cannot be ruled out.\nHence, the tribunal ruled that it needs to be prima facie shown that the related party transaction was properly examined and that comparable prices were objectively fixed in a bona fide or honest manner, as required by law.\nThe ruling also makes it clear that taxpayers need to undertake a detailed analysis while setting and documenting their transfer prices with related parties. Further, the ruling gives a direction to tax officers that once taxpayers undertake appropriate due diligence, their analysis cannot be rejected arbitrarily during audits based on inferences and presumptions.\nThe subject case related to the transfer pricing of captive software development services rendered by an Indian entity to its US parent.\nThe primary issue involved was the methodology used to select appropriate comparables for benchmarking the profits of the Indian taxpayer, in order to evaluate the adequacy (or otherwise) of the transfer prices between the Indian entity and its US parent.\nIn this particular case, the tax authorities made an upward adjustment to the taxpayer\u2019s income by not accepting the comparability analysis documented by the taxpayer.\nSimply put, a comparability analysis is made by comparing a related party transaction with an unrelated party transaction to demonstrate that the related party transaction meets the arm\u2019s length standard.\nThe matter reached the tribunal where certain fundamental principles relating to the Indian Transfer Pricing Code were decided. Among other things, the tribunal held that a proper study of all the specific characteristics of the transaction needs to be undertaken, including analysis of functions, assets and risks.\nThe comparison needs to take into account economically significant activities and responsibilities of the enterprises. A mere broad comparison is not enough. Risks are an important consideration in any transfer pricing analysis, which are related to the economic principle that the greater the risk, the higher the return. In the case of material differences in risks between the controlled enterprise and comparables, the identified comparables are not correct if appropriate adjustments for differences are not possible.\nAs per Indian regulations, appropriate adjustments are required to be carried out to sustain comparability. Where the adjustments do not necessarily bring the proposed comparable nearer to the taxpayer, comparability cannot be made. The tribunal emphasized that these regulations have the force of law.\nThe tax officer\u2019s order had several major and minor errors, which led to unsustainable results and thereby, upward adjustment to the taxpayer\u2019s income.The tribunal disregarded certain inferences and presumptions made by the audit officer and constructed a smaller set of companies from the taxpayer\u2019s set.\nWhile preparing such a reconstructed set, the tribunal mentioned that it was not selecting high-profit or high-loss companies in the set, as the taxpayer worked in a no-risk environment, being a captive.\nThe tribunal also concluded that the entire range of such a reconstructed set is representative of an arm\u2019s length range, as in the open market, buyers and sellers would settle for a price anywhere in the range. Accordingly, the tribunal held that as long as the taxpayer\u2019s profits fall in the complete range of comparables, it was sufficient compliance by the taxpayer.\nThe tribunal held that the average/mean of results of comparables applied where multiple transfer pricing methods were being used, and not where the application of a single method resulted in multiple prices.\nAccordingly, the tribunal concluded, in favour of the taxp"}

{"idx": "20452", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The way we approach business is changing. As we continually pivot to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology, individual departments within an organization are becoming as agile as the larger companies themselves. IT departments are experiencing tremendous changes as their roles expand to impact customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organizations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business.\nOne thing to understand when managing the growing pains of IT is that it\u2019s no longer the work of a single department. Research from Accenture found that 34% of companies see the IT department as the main driver of innovation, which is down from 71% two years ago. I see the reason for this as a change in IT infrastructure itself. The modern IT worker is a tech-savvy innovator who creates change across the organization\u2019s entirety, not just a single department. As employees create change across all levels of an organization, the new face of IT defies boundaries.\nIT workers aren\u2019t just facilitating business goals; they\u2019re driving change at an organizational level. CEOs are leaning on IT to deliver a competitive advantage as much as they do for a marketing strategy. It seems to me that this shift is directly related to \u201cThe Internet of Everything\u201d movement, which refers to the near future in which nearly every aspect of our lives will be connected to the Internet. Since our reliance on technology increases with each passing day, IT is steadily moving to the front end\u2014not the back\u2014of business.\nThe IT world is experiencing a need for upskilling in its employees, especially as the role of IT continues to evolve into a more interdisciplinary field. Machines are becoming increasingly intelligent, so we need to train our employees working alongside them to remain agile.\nJust as workers across the enterprise must become more tech-savvy, workers in the IT department must understand the nuances of marketing. CIOs must increasingly hire employees with business acumen, not just good technology support skills. Enterprises will need to adjust in response to a changing talent ecosystem.\nA few months ago, I expressed every brand\u2019s need for continuity among marketing, sales and customer service. It\u2019s clear that IT has a finger or two in all these pies. For a company to embrace these connections, it must see IT not as the lone geek pack, but rather as a field that supports the ebb and flow of business.\nIT departments are now the linchpin of agile organizations. Their influence is spreading within the organization, and CIOs must transform the workforce along with it. Consider how you\u2019ll construct a workforce and culture that drives innovation, as well as one that will facilitate the customer experience and encourage business growth. It seems like a tall order, but CIOs are confronted with these issues as the world around us becomes smarter. As CEOs realize their role in successfully launching new products, I believe we\u2019ll rely on IT with increasing frequency.\nSourcing so-called \u201cjack-of-all-trade\u201d talent for the new business ecosystem is one thing, but CIOs must also consider legacy systems as they relate to company goals. Reskilling existing teams will be necessary to maintain agility, so it\u2019s important to construct a team of employees who can handle the peaks and valleys of business.\nThis all sounds easier said than done, but there\u2019s one prevailing attitude in business that will never change: adapt or fail. Current employees must be on board with the changing face of IT in business, while new talent should enter a role with clear expectations. It\u2019s the CIO\u2019s role to facilitate these processes by reskilling legacy processes and seeking out adaptable talent. Collaboration with the C"}

MSRT is not an AV program, but instead a clean-up utility designed to eradicate malware that has already wormed onto a Windows PC.\nAround the same time, AV-Test, a German company that regularly evaluates antivirus products for Windows, said it had surveyed the major AV vendors, and found that most were going to continue providing customers with up-to-date signatures long after Microsoft pulls its XP patch plug.\nTencent and Qihoo, China\u2019s two largest AV providers, were on AV-Test\u2019s list.\nHowever, some readers interpreted the IDG News story differently, and came away with the impression that Microsoft was going to patch Windows XP systems in China after 8 April.\nAccording to the latest statistics from web analytics company Net Applications, Windows XP powered 29.5% of the world\u2019s personal computers in February.\nChina will not be getting special treatment, Microsoft confirmed today. \u201cThere\u2019s some confusion this morning based on statements from Microsoft China and third-party AV vendors,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nIn her email, she again repeated the standard Microsoft pitch to customers still running XP: Upgrade. \u201cOur advice is for customers to move from Windows XP to a modern operating system such as Windows 8.1,\u201d she wrote.\nThat advice has been blasted by customers and experts alike. Today, Microsoft reacted to some of that criticism by saying it would offer a free file transfer tool for Windows XP upgraders later this week.

Well, she\u2019s seen it and apparently she isn\u2019t all that impressed.\nWagner began playing tennis pro Jaime Sommers in episodes of ABC\u2019s The Six Million Dollar Man back in 1975. She was the perfect mate for former astronaut Steve Austin (Lee Majors) and became bionic after a tragic sky-diving accident. Steve pleaded with his boss Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) to save her with bionics and their romance was able to continue. Unfortunately, it all came to an abrupt halt when Jaime\u2019 body rejected her bionics and she died.\nFortunately, the audience loved the character and ABC asked that she be revived. We learned later that Jaime had been secretly cryogenically frozen until doctors could find a way to repair the cerebral clot that had ended her life. The surgery was a success except that it left Jaime with some brain damage which included the loss of most of her memories of Steve. Sad as that was, it was the perfect way to launch The Bionic Woman spin-off series with Wagner and Majors making occasional appearances on each other\u2019s respective shows. There was a happy ending to the story years later when Jaime regained her memories, rekindled her romance with Steve, and married him in a trio of reunion movies.\nThe new Bionic Woman series was generally well-reviewed and had the most online buzz of any new series this season. After a strong opening episode of 13.9 million viewers, the ratings have slipped in subsequent installments. The second episode dropped to 10.9 million viewers while the third came in at 10.1 million. The ratings would have to drop quite a bit before the peacock network would consider canceling it, especially considering the network\u2019s disastrous season last year. The network recently ordered three additional scripts but doesn\u2019t have enough faith just yet to give a greenlight for more filming. The original Bionic Woman series lasted three seasons (two on ABC, one on NBC). Despite being \u201ccooler,\u201d will the new version last as long as the original? Time will tell. Stay tuned!\nAfter the Writers Strike, Who\u2019s Not Coming Back?\nIt is too bad that anyone would make such a reckless and actually quite lazy attempt to pirate a very popular character from the 70\u2019s.\nI mean, if they had changed this new character\u2019s name and left the idea of \u201cthe 1st bionic woman\u201d to Lindsay Wagner\u2019s character (the only legitimate Jaime Sommers on TV), they would have had a better chance to recapture some of the original show\u2019s following (and maybe its related product marketing fanfare).\nToo bad the concept has now been destroyed with this insipid 2007 hack job.

With a loud \"psssssss\" the air escaped from the ballast tanks and the small craft suddenly tilted forward.\nWithin seconds, aquanaut Robert Carmichael and I were enveloped by a vibrant shade of blue, watching streaks of sunlight pierce the water's surface. Soon a large manta ray appeared from the darkness below, gently gliding toward our small craft before vanishing into the distance.\nThe dive took place off a coral atoll called St. Joseph in the outer islands of Seychelles on a mission to explore the Indian Ocean. This body of water is poorly studied and few scientists have ever ventured deeper than the maximum scuba depth of 100 feet.\nFor more than a month researchers from Nekton, a British-led scientific research charity, have been using submersibles to dive deep below the waves to document the ocean's health.\nWe arrived at St. Joseph Island in the early hours of the morning, and this was the first submersible dive at the new site. The sea bed suddenly appeared beneath our craft, a landscape no one had ever seen before.\nI quickly scribbled down in the mission report the depth and time at which we sighted the bottom: \"165 feet, 1144 UTC.\" Carmichael, a veteran of the sea, relayed the information to the surface via an underwater telephone. Its loud static noise would be a constant of our dive.\nWe moved across a seabed of rock and sand and scattered soft coral until a great darkness opened ahead. Carmichael lowered us over the side of an underwater cliff. Our target depth was 400 feet.\nOceans cover over two-thirds of the Earth's surface but remain, for the most part, unexplored.\nTheir role in regulating our climate and the threats they face are underestimated by many people, so scientific missions are crucial to take stock of the health of underwater ecosystems.\nAble to operate down to 1,000 feet, these manned submersibles give scientists a unique understanding of changes in habitats as sunlight diminishes through the different layers of ocean. We glided with the current as six cameras mounted around the craft recorded its journey. In the months to come, researchers at Oxford will comb through the footage frame by frame, noting each species encountered.\nSuddenly a drop of cold water landed on my arm, triggering alarm. Water is best kept on the outside of a submersible. Carmichael quickly put me at ease: The difference in temperature between the water around us and our submersible had created a layer of condensation on the hatch. We quickly soaked it up with towels.\nIt was curiosity that drew Carmichael to the ocean. \"I just wanted to know what was down here,\" he said. \"It's stunning in so many ways.\"\nThis curiosity has attracted mankind for centuries. \"The human mind is naturally drawn to grandiose notions of supernatural beings, and the sea is the ideal medium for them,\" wrote Jules Verne, author of \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\" possibly the greatest submarine novel of all time, which opens with fears over a mysterious sea monster sinking ships and harvesting the lives of sailors.\nThirty years after reading the novel as a child, I'm sitting in a tiny glass bubble observing the underwater world like Captain Nemo on board the novel's submarine, Nautilus.

Results from the Phase 2-A trial, released in January, showed that Koronis\u2019 experimental drug does increase the frequency of mutations in the HIV genome.\nMore trials have to be done to determine if the Koronis drug can essentially take down the HIV virus, but at least one analyst believes it could be a game changer. Katherine Xu, a biotech analyst for William Blair, said in a report earlier this year that the Koronis drug has \u201chuge potential for disruption.\u201d One scenario she paints: that the Koronis drug be given in combination with an existing drug like Atripla and \u201cafter a year or so, the viruses could be mutated out of existence and the patients could achieve a cure,\u201d Xu wrote in a report for Wedbush Securities, where she worked until recently. \"If it were to be successful, it would be great news for the field,\" Xu told me last week in a phone interview.\nScientists at Koronis have been able to eradicate HIV in a petri dish. Doing so in humans is likely to be much more difficult, but worth a try. Traditional HIV drugs attempt to block viral replication. Koronis CEO Donald Elmer explains that the Koronis drug uses the viral replication process to induce additional mutations in the HIV genome by mismatch base pairing. \"These additional mutations progressively debilitate the virus, which ultimately results in collapse of the viral population,\" he says.\nThis month marks 30 years since the virus now called HIV made its first horrific emergence among gay men. Incredible progress has been made in the decades since, but almost all of that is evidenced in the U.S. and Europe. Of the 33 million people living with HIV, 25 million are not currently being treated; 90% of the $14 billion a year spent on treating HIV is focused in North America and Europe.\n\u201cOutside the U.S., HIV is still a pandemic,\u201d says Koronis CEO Elmer, who adds that treating HIV is complicated and requires regular monitoring \u2013something that just isn\u2019t happening in poor countries. Thus the urgent need for a new kind of treatment. A lurking concern \u2013and another reason to pursue new kinds of drugs -- is the rise of drug-resistant HIV.\nThe next step for Koronis is to come up with $15 million to $20 million to perform a clinical trial that would combine its drug candidate with an approved drug that is currently used for HIV treatment. The company has raised $43 million since it was founded in 2002 but is in need of outside cash. It\u2019s in discussions with the six big companies that operate in the HIV sector \u2013 Gilead (GILD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Viiv (which is a joint venture between Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline), Johnson & Johnson and Merck -"}

They are wholly dependent on powerful people and institutions and that means they must tell lies on a constant basis. Because BAR provides analysis from a black left perspective we must wade through their falsehoods in our attempt to make sense of the world.\nBAR\u2019s commitment has not gone unnoticed. Our team is proud to be on a list of outlets accused of being purveyors of Russian government propaganda. The website Is It Propaganda or Not suddenly appeared in August of this year. No one owns up to having created it but that mystery is frankly unimportant. The site is clearly doing the work of the Democratic Party, which unsuccessfully used charges of Russian interference in American politics in the recent presidential election.\nIs It Propaganda or Not is a sad attempt to continue a losing effort in the waning months of the Obama administration. The United States brooks no opposition anywhere in the world. Russia\u2019s determination to uphold its right to self-determination made it an enemy of the voracious American appetite for control of resources and governments. When Barack Obama often said that America was the indispensable nation he meant it. George W. Bush was less eloquent when he declared \u201cyou\u2019re either with us or against us.\u201d Obama said the same thing as he cajoled and bullied nations to join the American imperialist effort or be run over.\nThe president harps on \u201cfake news\u201d out of desperation. He hopes to continue his imperialist legacy right up until January 20, 2017 when Donald Trump becomes president. Actually, he wants to make the case for it after Trump takes over. Obama is doing whatever he can to drum up support for the endless wars and regime change policies he ultimately failed to solidify. Trump got enough votes to claim electoral victory in part because no one except dead ender Democrats are buying what Obama is selling.\nInstigating a coup in Ukraine certainly struck a blow in the 25-year long American effort at Russian subjugation and/or regime change. But Ukraine is now a shell of its former self, broke and suffering from a deadly civil war. Syria limps along after the United States, NATO, gulf monarchies and Turkey thought they could carve it up easily. It isn\u2019t surprising that the BAR team or anyone else who called out the scoundrels would themselves be targets of official wrath, no matter how foolishly carried out.\nThe creation of this list is a bizarre effort to keep Donald Trump from making good on some of his campaign promises. It isn\u2019t clear if he will act to improve relations with Russia or put an end to regime change. He also says that America should \u201cgrab the oil\u201d but any mention of ditching years of foreign policy orthodoxy is considered a heresy that must be stamped out.\nThe foolishness of the Is It Propaganda or Not stunt shows why the Democratic Party has been consigned to loser status. It isn\u2019t interested in being a political party at all. It is a gigantic marketing scheme meant to keep fearful progressives in line. The Democrats want the presidency so they can cut deals with Republicans and curry favor with elites around the world.

Products containing imazaquin are also effective, but that particular material can delay greenup in centipedegrass if applied after the first of February, so at this point the safest approach would be 2,4-D.

Transformed ex-gay leaders are the best argument for their movement. Likewise, those who've left the ex-gay movement in despair and disgust are the best counterargument. The debate continued this June, when Exodus International held its 32nd annual conference in Irvine, California, featuring dozens of speakers and seminar leaders who have quit homosexuality. Down the road outside the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, a news conference featured three former Exodus leaders saying \"ex-gay\" is a delusion.\nNew research may change the terms of debate.

{"idx": "20484", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 Under California\u2019s new cap-and-trade program, the state is considering allowing a controversial form of carbon credits that have been rejected by the European Union as ineffective and potentially harmful to rainforests in developing countries. Now an international coalition of environmental groups including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Sierra Club California is urging Gov. Jerry Brown to reject the so-called REDD credits, which could endanger the lives and livelihoods of indigenous forest peoples.\nSince California signed a memorandum of understanding in 2010 with Chiapas, Mexico and Acre, Brazil, the state Air Resources Board has been working to forge an agreement to allow California industries, under the Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), to offset their pollution by purchasing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation credits that supposedly promote rainforest conservation in those areas.\n[The] proposal is not only unlikely to deliver real, additional and permanent emission reductions, but it would also prevent Californians from getting the benefits of AB 32 at home. By allowing enterprises to buy international forest offsets, the amount of industrial emissions within the state would be greater than otherwise allowed by law, exposing people here in California to greater health and environmental risks, and preventing progressive Californian companies from benefitting from new technologies and innovations.\nEurope\u2019s emissions trading system, the largest carbon market in the world -- itself beset by scandals and failure to reduce emissions in Europe -- does not accept REDD credits. The EU says reductions in carbon emissions from forest preservation are impossible to verify accurately, that preserving one forest in one place may only drive deforestation to another area, and that industrial pollution remains in the atmosphere for centuries while forests are more vulnerable to short-term changes.\nTropical forests have unique social, economic and cultural significance to those who live in and depend on them for their livelihoods. But REDD projects like the one California is considering raise serious concerns about violations of the rights of forest dwellers.\n\"Forest carbon projects are causing grave human rights abuses, including evictions, land grabs, jailing, persecution of activists and violations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d said Alberto Saldamando, a spokesman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. \"California should not repeat its mistakes of the past with regard to indigenous peoples, in order to let polluters continue to pollute.\"\nEnvironmental justice advocates also pointed out that communities in the shadow of polluting industries, like Chevron\u2019s refinery in Richmond and Shell\u2019s in Martinez, see REDD as a failure to address their concerns as well.\n\"We have struggled to ensure that ARB addresses the needs of low-income communities and communities of color in AB 32 implementation,\u201d said Strela Cervas, coordinator of the California Environmental Justice Alliance. \u201cBut they have continued to pass harmful and ineffective offset programs that only benefit big polluters. ARB has shown little concern for communities of color here at home-- how can we expect them to ensure a California REDD program will protect the rights of communities abroad?\"\nFind more from Friends Of The Earth on InfoPages."}

Central linebacker Mohammad Kamara signed to Temple on Dec. 19, but is in the process of being released following the team\u2019s second coaching change in a month, according to his brother, Amara Kamara.\nA 6-2, 205-pound senior, Mohammad committed and signed to Manny Diaz, who was announced Temple head coach on Dec. 13, after former coach Geoff Collins took the Georgia Tech job on Dec. 7.\nSoon after Kamara, a three-star, and other Temple commits signed, things changed. Diaz was offered the University of Miami head coaching job after the Hurricanes' 35-3 loss to Wisconsin in the Pinstripe Bowl. Diaz had just accepted the Temple job 17 days before, but would return to Miami, where he\u2019d served as defensive coordinator since 2016.\nTemple then appointed Rod Carey as head coach on Jan. 11. Carey spent six years at Northern Illinois.\nThe second coaching change led to a mutual separation. Temple has agreed to send Mohammad\u2019s waived letter of intent to the NCAA.\nKamara will be cleared to talk to other schools once he receives his waived contract back from the NCAA.\nBefore signing to Temple, Kamara held offers from Rutgers, Boston College, Colorado and others. Some of those opportunities dried up as his recruitment continued into the fall.\nMohammad isn\u2019t yet allowed to talk to coaches from other schools because of the terms of his national letter of intent. However, according to Amara, who played for Temple from 2007 to 2010, Mohammad should be free to talk with coaches from any school within a week.\nIn the meantime, Amara, who serves as Mohammad\u2019s assistant coach at Central, is handling his brother\u2019s search.\nKamara was one of New Jersey\u2019s top defensive performers in 2018, with 132 tackles, 11 sacks, six forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and one interception in 10 games. He added seven catches for 126 receiving yards and three TDs, 55 rushing yards and a rushing TD."}

Research into the condition is largely focused on the development of new therapies. However, new therapies need diagnostic methods which are affordable and minimally invasive and can be used to screen large populations,\u201d Dr Engel explained.\nAlzheimer\u2019s is one of the most devastating brain diseases, affecting 48 million worldwide and an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 people in Ireland, with an associated cost of up to \u20ac400 million per year to the healthcare system.\nNo new therapy has passed clinical trials in 20 years, and much of the failure in clinical trials has been attributed to application of therapies at advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, where damage to the brain becomes irreversible.\nFor treatments to be successful, early stages preceding full onset of Alzheimer\u2019s need to be targeted. At present there is no blood test available to clinicians that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s, though many researchers throughout the world are seeking to develop reliable options. The challenge is to be able to distinguish from symptoms that are part of the natural ageing process or other neurodegenerative diseases similar to Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe unique aspects of the RCSI test is that it enables prediction of who will develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and the ability to identify those likely to develop related conditions, notably vascular dementia, Dr Engel said.\nThis study was carried out by scientists from Ireland and Spain, including the work of PhD student Aidan Kenny, based at RCSI Department of Physiology and Medical Physics. The test was developed based on evaluation of 1,000 patients in Madrid. The next step is to extend it to patients in Ireland and other locations, Dr Engel said."}

Who would have guessed a country that can't afford tractors would fail to reach space?\nThe launch was first announced by South Korea's YTN television network.\nThe upper stage of the launcher is designed to carry a lightweight satellite-about 100kg-so it's not clear that structurally it could carry a 1-ton (1000kg) nuclear warhead. But if it could, we estimate this technology could theoretically launch a one-ton warhead to about 10,000-11,000 km ( 6500 miles).\nThey could certainly launch a 1-ton warhead on the first two stages, and that would have a range of about 7.500 km (5000 miles).\nWe have not seen North Korea flight test a heat shield for a long-range missile. Because the reentry heating increases with the square of the warhead's speed, the heating would be about 10 times worse for an ICBM than for North Korea's Nodong missile. Heat shield technology is well understood, but you would expect to see a flight test of it if North Korea wanted to have confidence that it could both launch a warhead and get it back to the ground.\nAnd now it's flying through the air.\nUpdate: NBC News reports the White House will issue a statement on the launch shortly.\nUpdate 2: The Aviationist's David Cenciotti points out that there's currently a Korean Airlines plane on the rocket's project flight path.

We had such high hopes this time around.\nUpdate 8: The AP, also citing \"US officials,\" is now saying the rocket may have failed.\nUpdate 9: Japan's defense minister now agrees the rocket broke up faster than 3LW.\nUpdate 10: CNN relays Japan's report that the rocket flew for \"about a minute\" before falling to pieces.\nUpdate 11: This image is currently being broadcast on North Korean state television, which is a pretty accurate representation of today's grand failure.\nDespite the failure of its attempted missile launch, North Korea's provocative action threatens regional security, violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments.

It lists his holdings \u2014 stocks, mutual funds and retirement accounts.\nSo when Drury filed to run for the Democratic nomination for attorney general, he filed a receipt, a move that he said the law permits, that indicated his economic interest statement was already online and available to the public.\nThomas Rottman, a business agent for Operating Engineers Union Local 150 in Chicago, challenged Drury's ballot standing because Drury failed to file a new form that was identical to the one already on file.\nAn ISBE hearing office recommended Drury be thrown off the ballot, while the board's legal counsel said Drury had met the legal requirements to remain a candidate.\nThe board voted 5-3 \u2014 all three members who voted to oust Drury are Democrats \u2014 to reject the challenge.\nIllinois courts have made it clear that technical violations \u2014 not filing a copy of a statement already on file is pretty technical and not even a violation \u2014"}

I learn something new every single time I complete the process.\nThis time, I really tried to strike a balance between keeping things I need, love and will use again ... and winding up on an episode of Hoarders.\nSince this isn't my first rodeo, I've picked up some wisdom along the way. Gather around and let me share some tips with you.\n1. Start preparing before the move. On the front end of our move, I purge things that I don't want to bother unpacking on the back end. Need cash? Start a few months ahead of time and sell on eBay and Craigslist, or have a yard sale. Feeling flush? Give it to Goodwill in one fell swoop. If you don't feel like unpacking it, don't let them pack it in the first place.\n2. Plan where things are going to go ahead of time. Do you have pictures or a floor plan of your new house? Then you can plan where things are going to go ahead of time. The movers totally appreciate not moving the piano around while you decide where you want it, too.\nBut I will admit even though I try to plan where things will go in the new house ahead of time, at the end of our unpacking period, I am usually still left with items that just won't fit in this particular house.\nQuick tip: An unbreakable rule of moving is that two houses, even if they are exact same square footage, will not hold the same amount of furniture in the same configuration. It is what it is.\n3. Impose a two-week deadline. My goal is to get all of my boxes unpacked within two weeks of the unload. By then, I usually know what fits and what doesn't.\nIn the past, I used to try to get rid of everything that didn't work in this particular house, and then I'd wind up re-purchasing the same item when I needed it in the next house.What a waste of time and money!\nIf you love a piece and intend to use it again, try with all your might to make it fit. I currently have a dresser in my closet, a table in my hallway, and a bookshelf in my bathroom. I promise it all works -- it even makes me decorate more creatively.\nIf all else fails, I stash things in my garage, attic or pool shed. If I used it in the last house and will use it in the next house, it's not hoarding!\n4. Beware holiday decor! I donate unused holiday decorations when I pack up after the fact. If I haven't used them in two years, they are gone. Sometimes, they get the ax after one year -- I'm trying to simplify.\n5. Impose the one-year rule. It's OK not to ditch my sweaters and scarves if we're spending a few years in the Deep South. However, if I haven't worn a piece of seasonal clothing in my closet in a year, it's outta there! I also have a strict one-in-one-out rule for shoes, mostly because I keep them in nice plastic bins and I have a set number. Sad, but true.\n6. Create memory boxes for the kids. My kids get to have a few boxes of \"memories\" that we drag all over the place, no questions asked. \"Normal\" people have basements, attics, garages etc. and don't have to throw away their childhoods; my military brats should be able to do the same.\n"}

Concurrently, the vitriolic anti-Sri Lanka Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu considers the invitation as being \u201ctantamount to rubbing salt into the wounds of the already deeply injured Tamil psyche\u201d\u009d. Not to be left out, Ramadoss too has joined the protestors. The Congress Party has sided with the Tamil parties, probably with the hope that the Tamils in the Southern state will help it to come back to power at some future date, after having faced a humiliating drubbing by the voters at the just-concluded election.\nClarifications by the authorities in New Delhi that the foreign policy of the government of India is a matter for the Central Government and is not a decision left to be made at the state government level has clearly fallen on deaf ears, especially of those in Tamil Nadu. Not only are the latter deaf, but they are completely blind as well: the venomously racist Tamil supremacy that they hold dear to the hearts prevents them from seeing what exists in the real world as far as Sri Lanka and its Tamils are concerned.\nThe war that culminated in May 2009 was not a civil war, nor was it a war waged by the Sinhalese (government) against the Tamils living in Sri Lanka. It was a war of liberation that was forced upon the legally elected government of Sri Lanka by a band of ruthless terrorists in the Tamil ethnic group. The LTTE that was instrumental in implementing the armed aggression in the pursuit of its mono-ethnic Tamil Eelam has been categorized as a terrorist group in nearly 32 countries worldwide.\nIf one were to read only the statements and the lamentations that Jayalalitha, Karunanidhi, Vaiko, Ramadoss and others of their ilk keep on dishing out to the gullible Tamil Nadu voter and look at the bucketfuls of tears that the Tamil Nadu big boss keeps on shedding on behalf of the \u2018suffering\u2019 Sri Lanka Tamils, one can be excused for running away with the idea that LTTE was a bunch of innocent babes that were massacred by Sri Lanka\u2019s armed forces. If the reader cares to venture beyond that, he or she will then see how the blood thirsty LTTE killers, which included women as well as the young, cut to death or blew to smithereens innocent farmers, monks, worshippers, schoolchildren and other members of the public that belonged to all ethnic religious groups.\nWhen someone invites another for an event, it is simple and traditional politeness to accept the invitation, unless the two are mortal enemies of each other. Therefore, it is natural to expect the President of Sri Lanka to attend the swearing-in ceremony. Vaiko has got hold of the whole issue at the wrong end when he says \u201cRajapaksa should be prevented\u201d\u009d from attending the event. The President of Sri Lanka is not barging in or gate"}

Assistant U.S. attorneys are appointed by the U.S. Attorney General to serve under the U.S. attorney in the district, who is, in turn, appointed by the U.S. president. Assistants are assigned cases by the U.S. attorney and are responsible for litigating civil and criminal matters in which the United States is named as a party. Assistant U.S. attorneys often handle high-profile cases with strong precedent implications.\nU.S. attorneys and their assistant attorneys serve as the principal federal litigators under the U.S. attorney general. The mission of this position is to conduct trial work in which the United States is a party. This trial work falls within three general categories: prosecution of criminal cases commenced by the federal government, prosecution or defense of civil cases to which the U.S. is a party and the collection of debts owed to the U.S.\nThe appointed U.S. attorney in a given district is responsible for delegating cases and supervising assistant attorneys. Assistants are given prosecuting authority consistent with that of the head U.S. attorney and have great discretion in making decisions related to each case. In the criminal context, assistant U.S. attorneys have the authority to file charges, request an indictment, decline prosecution or negotiate plea bargains. Civilly, assistant U.S. attorneys are permitted to initiate complaints, participate in discovery and negotiate a settlement.\nSpecial assistant U.S. attorneys are appointed by the U.S. attorney general to assist in the preparation of cases requiring extra attention. This is sometimes required in cases of complex litigation that raises legal questions or issues not often litigated. Special assistants are usually chosen from private practices and possess highly specialized legal knowledge in a particular area.\nAssistant U.S. attorneys must live within 25 miles of the district represented by their supervisory U.S. attorneys. There are 93 U.S. attorneys serving 94 districts. The assistant U.S. attorney only prosecutes or defends cases arising out of transactions or incidents taking place within the district. Some states are comprised of just one district, while other, larger states are made up of two, three or four districts.\nSalaries for assistant U.S. attorneys are set by the U.S. Department of Justice. Attorneys hired by the U.S. attorneys' offices are set by statute under an administratively determined pay scale. Beginning assistant attorneys with a law degree are paid a GS-11 step one salary, which is approximately $50,287, not including locality pay. Assistant attorneys with a law degree and one-year judicial clerkship or advanced degree are paid GS-12 step one, or $60,274, not including locality pay. Attorneys working in areas with a higher cost of living are paid higher salaries. For example, a GS-11 step one salary in New York City is $64,729. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job growth outlook across the entire attorney profession is 10 percent, or about average. The BLS speculates that government budget constraints will moderate growth for federal attorneys.\nReid, Stephanie. \"The Role of the Assistant U.S. Attorney"}

The beauty of dialogue is that it can deepen discovery.\nSo in one of his letters, Einstein was enlisted with an opinion that the word God pointed only to an image made in man\u2019s own likeness \u2013 simply a commonly shared figment of the imagination; and as such, implying that God does not exist.\nI had not known that such an eminent scientist had expressed such an opinion, although I was once intrigued to hear that the same scientist, who was able to use his own imagination so well as to discover that space and time are interchangeable and that time curves \u2013 something that I myself can neither understand nor imagine, but am nonetheless intrigued by the idea, because I did read somewhere that this same great scientist was very interested in the Eucharist.\nIn fact, I\u2019m grateful to him because I can imaging as a present reality that if time and space are interchangeable and Jesus Christ is alive in heaven, then the Eucharist is the perfect future derivative that delivers what it promises.\nSo scientific hypotheses, including the big bang and now quantum realities, are helping me appreciate more completely eternal life through the death, resurrection, and the mystical nature of baptism therein.\nIt\u2019s in this context that the general method of scientific thinking, when careful and unbiased, can help through human experience to come back to the God-question.\nSo my feeling for science have brought me to agree completely with the Bible where it says \u201cthe fool says in his heart, there is no God\u201d (Psalms 14 and 53) from personal experience.\nAt point of death I realised that this was a perverse thought imagined for the comfort in the mind of not admitting to one\u2019s own prideful errors deep in our souls and deciding that these errors are not our fault but are due to God himself being unjust.\nThis is the height of pride as a result of which we disagree with God\u2019s justice that we will have nothing to do with him in eternity, choosing to be lost in matter in purposeful isolation for ever, even if he is the winner in life, so to speak.\nYou can avoid this hellish decision simply by saying to yourself in your heart that God does not exist and your life will be snuffed out completely like the flame on the candle.\nThank goodness that your mind can rescue you even at the last breath of your life on earth.\nIn my case, many years ago I was perverse enough to await my last moment after a serious accident with this foolish comfort when a cry from the very essence of my being called out for mercy, which I felt immediately and understood that God is so good that his mercy is greater than his justice.\nThank God our intellect can finally see how false it is to imagine that its okay for everybody to be snuffed out like candles irrespective of the good and unrepented evil in their lives.\nThis is science and faith in perfect harmony. With regard to your idea that God is evil because of natural disasters, or even for permitting what appear to be natural material aberrations from the norm, to say nothing of human evil itself, the general empirical methodology of thought can help us because science will help us arrive at the reflection of the reflection of the intimate nature of God as Trinitarian in our soul and the purpose of freedom to reach out to one another in our troubles in him in a natural way.\nThis is because he is perfect, almighty, just,"}

Sabry thought it was better than covering up with a shawl or using a bottle, as most Egyptian women did when feeding their infants in public. But the covers were uncommon, and the few who knew about them had to depend on someone bringing the apron-like wraps from abroad. Sabry, the new mother, approached her old friend Doaa Zaki with the question: Why not make a nursing cover in Egypt?\nThis ties in with their hope of creating employment opportunities, the 27-year-old Zaki says, especially in a period of Egypt\u2019s struggling economy. At the same time, they say they\u2019re defying stereotypes of women who wear the niqab, as they choose to do, showing that rather than being mute, they are active in their pursuits and in their desire to impact their surroundings.\nNeither Sabry nor Zaki intended to go into business. They met a decade ago during a religious lecture given by a sheikh. While most of the crowd was straight-faced, the two were giggling teenaged girls. From then, they became inseparable. Sabry later went to study architecture, and Zaki went into dentistry. Sabry married first and had two daughters; Zaki wedded after and now has two sons. When the idea of the nursing covers first emerged, Zaki, then in her final year at Ain Shams University, went to the teeming textile district around Al Azhar Street in old Cairo to collect material for their prototype. Working with a tailor, they made four nursing covers modeled after the one Sabry had gotten from overseas, and then sold those to friends in one sitting. They spent a lot of time (not to mention their own money) getting the end product right, visiting numerous shops to narrow down the appropriate fabric, and testing samples on themselves and their friends. \u201cThere were many mistakes at first,\u201d Sabry says. \u201cWe learned the textile was very heavy; then we knew we should make it soft.\u201d They opted for 100 percent cotton, which they say is better for babies. It also took them time to find tailors, and tried out many until they found the ones who could deliver the high standards they sought.\nMeanwhile, Best Mums had to explain the utility of its product to prospective consumers and sellers. \u201cIt took time to be known,\u201d Sabry says. The women created a logo and took out ads in magazines, went to baby fairs and bazaars and family sports clubs, and created a popular Facebook page. A relative of Sabry\u2019s whose father owns the Love and Care chain of stores, initially took a dozen nursing covers for the shops. Sabry and Zaki spread the word first among friends, and soon the chain started asking for larger quantities to stock up on. The women also got help from a friend\u2019s husband who sells breast pumps to stores; he took some of the nursing covers along with him to his clients. And when the women passed by shops selling baby supplies, they would approach the owners and pitch their product.\nBeing business owners who happen to wear face veils in public, Sabry and Zaki say they are turning perceptions upside down.\nBesides being a product, nursing covers seem to serve a higher purpose, too.

A federal District Court judge in that lawsuit found that the ski area had immunity because collisions with other skiers is considered an inherent risk.\nThey should be held responsible if they are negligent in their maintenance of resort infrastructure, as was the case when Vail failed to properly mitigate a piece of metal sticking out from a skier bridge that was due for replacement at the end of the season, resulting in the injury of a season pass-holder.\nAnd the legislature should spell out that additional waivers like those signed by season pass-holders are against public policy, as the Utah Supreme Court has determined.\nFinally, recent contradictory lower-court rulings over whether an avalanche is an inherent risk of skiing also should be reconciled.

Three states \u2014 Texas, Iowa, and Illinois \u2014 will be home to over half of the wind capacity additions for the year.

In 2018 the winter was colder and the summer hotter than in 2017, and the economy grew by almost 3 percent - contributing to higher CO2 emissions.\nThe agency goes on to say that if the weather returns to something closer to normal and economic growth moderates, then we should see a decline in CO2 emissions.

The dentist was later forced to give up his practice after suffering from neurological and autoimmune symptoms.\nEvidence presented by Northwestern Mutual was insufficient and did not address the \u201cspecific insurance policy at issue in this case,\u201d the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in a 2-1 decision earlier this month.\nThe dentist, Douglas G. Weiher, had applied on May 4, 2010, for a Northwestern Mutual policy that agreed to pay $8,400 in monthly benefits. Northwestern Mutual argued that Weiher promised he would cancel a disability policy he had with Great-West within three months of applying for the Northwestern Mutual policy.\nWhen Northwestern Mutual discovered that the dentist had never canceled the contract with Great-West, it went to court to rescind Weiher\u2019s policy. The district court ruled in favor of Northwestern Mutual. Weiher, who claimed he forgot the cancel the policy, appealed the judgement.\nIn a majority opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Kelly wrote that under Wisconsin law, the question wasn\u2019t whether \u2014 as Northwestern Mutual argued \u2014 the carrier would not have issued the policy had it known Weiher would continue coverage under his Great-West policy.\nThe question is whether the failure to cancel the Northwestern Mutual policy \u201cincreased the risk at the time of the loss, i.e., when Weiher became disabled and made a claim for benefits in 2012,\u201d three years after taking out the Northwestern Mutual contract.\nEven if Northwestern Mutual had shown that Weiher schemed and intentionally overinsured himself in 2009 to collect from as many as three disability policies \u2014 one from Unum, another from Great-West and a third from Northwestern Mutual \u2014 Northwestern Mutual never addressed whether insuring Weiher in 2009 meant that the risk to the company had increased by 2012, the court said.\n\u201cWeiher, on the other hand, offered evidence showing that, based on his income in 2012, he was not over-insured at the time of loss,\u201d Judge Kelly wrote.

I felt it was touching every single line,\" Azarenka said. \"She took a medical timeout but she rips winners all over the place and I was like, 'Can I have a back problem?' I'm feeling great, but I'm missing every shot.\"\nAfter wasting two set points on Azarenka's serve late in the second set, Hampton had to leave the court for nine minutes to have treatment on her back.\nAzarenka practiced her backhands and serve while Hampton was in the locker room, but the break didn't help her immediately. Hampton returned and held in the next game and needed more treatment in the break at the end of the set.\nEven with the pain of two herniated disks, the 23-year-old Hampton, from Auburn, Ala., went down swinging - making 47 unforced errors to go with the winners that caught Azarenka off guard and had her asking, loudly at one point, what she could do to counter them.\nSensing an upset, and stirred by the obvious pain, the crowd on Rod Laver Arena got right behind the No. 63-ranked Hampton, who had never gone past the second round at a major.\nAzarenka had her share of supporters in the stands, too, including friend and musician RedFoo who was wearing a shirt emblazoned with \"We Go Hard\" across the front.\nAzarenka's potential semifinal rival, Serena Williams, had the next match on Rod Laver Arena against Ayumi Morita of Japan.

But success arrived only after everything almost fell apart.\nOn Feb. 15 the Somerset County commissioners held a press conference to announce that funding for Route 219 was in jeopardy. The project was deemed vital to the economic development of Somerset County. But changes to federal law meant the state's plan for accessing federal funds would no longer work.\nThe community rallied behind the project in response to the commissioners' announcement. Community support peaked as hundreds gathered at the courthouse in support of the project.\nIn May the commissioners met with Gov. Ed Rendell to stress the importance of a completed Route 219. Two months later, the commissioners announced that the state had approved $35 million for the project. The road would be the only highway project approved in the state for the year.\nDuring the Somerset County Chamber of Commerce's annual banquet, U.S. Reps. John Murtha and Bill Shuster, state Sens. Richard Kasunic and John Wozniak, and state Reps. Bob Bastian and Tom Yewcic were commended for their efforts in helping to get the funding.\nAt year's end the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was making plans to acquire rights of way and perform utility work in 2009.\nGas prices took a major leap, reaching $4 a gallon on June 8, just in time for the peak summer travel season.\nOil prices neared $140 a barrel. All Americans felt the pinch, with increased prices also translating into higher costs for food and other goods that have to be transported. Diesel fuel costs were even higher. It was doubly difficult in Somerset County and other rural areas without mass transit.\nMunicipalities were looking for ways to reduce costs. State police troopers were told to avoid jack rabbit starts and to travel at or below the speed limit whenever possible. Somerset Borough police used a motorcycle and bicycles to reduce fuel expenditures. A number of fire departments decided to send fewer trucks to area parades.\nPrices began to come down in November. Home heating oil was up 10 cents from November 2007, but down significantly since the summer. In July oil was $4.49 a gallon. In November it was $2.79.\nGasoline prices also fell, reaching $1.69 just before Christmas.\nThis ongoing story was the No. 1 story as voted by readers of dailyamerican.com.

The President has now no choice but to wait for the formal report the UN would release on Monday to expose the real culprit behind the use of chemical weapons in Syria which reportedly killed 1500 people, among them, women and children.\nBut does it really matter what the UN report would be?\nObama has already said that beyond a reasonable doubt, Assad is to blame for the chemical massacre and any claim to the contrary would be bizarrely detrimental to the interests of Washington.\nBesides, war-thirty Obama may have to wait until September 9 when the Congress recess will be over. But what of that? He has already said he does not need anyone else\u2019s permission though he\u2019ll go to Congress for approval before launching a strike against Syria.\n\u201cWhile I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger \u2026 and our actions will be even more effective\u201d if the strike is authorized by Congress,\u2019 Obama said Saturday in a televised address from the Rose Garden.\nWhilst the western media are brandishing the blade of blame at the Syrian government, other independent sources claim the rebels are to blame as they improperly used the chemical weapons provided to them via Saudi intelligence boss and mastermind of political mayhem in the region Bandar bin Sultan AKA Bandar Bush.\nAccording to a recent report published by Mint Press News, the rebels and local residents in Syrian Ghouta claim that Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan is behind providing chemical weapons to an al-Qaida-affiliated group.\nCertain rebels received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the dealing gas attack.\nAbdel-Moneim said his son and 12 other rebels were killed inside a weapons tunnel provided by a Saudi militant known as Abu Ayesha. The father described the weapons as having a \u201ctube-like structure\u201d while others were like a \u201chuge gas bottle.\u201d Abdel-Moneim said his son and the others died during the chemical weapons attack.\nIn consideration of the fact that the government of Assad could possibly reap no benefits in using chemical weapons on its own civilians, it would be a rather fair judgment to believe that the Takfiris fighting against the government of Assad and who have a long history of brutalities from beheading the Syrians to eating their innards would be held accountable for the chemical attacks.

The authors of the study, published in August in the American Journal of Infection Control, recommend that hospitals and doctors minimize the use of these products pending further research into their effect on patient safety.\nNo infections have been linked to the drops thus far. The study only suggests that they could heighten the risk of contamination. \"Finding residual fluid in scopes that should be dry would be troubling alone,\" says Cori Ofstead, the study's lead author. \"The finding of fluid containing simethicone suggests we have more serious problems. It could explain why we are having more trouble getting these scopes clean.\"\nInfant gas relief drops, which are available over the counter, contain sugars and thickeners to make the liquid solutions more palatable for babies, the researchers say. Ofstead said those ingredients \"could provide the perfect habitat for the growth of bacteria\" inside scopes.\nThe liquid drops contain silicone, which doesn't dissolve in water and can't be removed using detergents or disinfectants. The researchers said that silicone could add an impenetrable coating to blood, tissue and other organic material trapped inside scopes. It can also foster the growth of biofilm, a slimy material that protects bacteria and other microbes from being removed during cleaning.\nOfstead, an epidemiologist and chief executive of the medical research firm Ofstead & Associates in St. Paul, Minn., said these findings were \"absolutely surprising\" and that her research team stumbled upon them during a broader look at scope cleaning techniques.\nThe seven-month study was conducted with physicians and a surgery center affiliated with the University of Minnesota Health system. There was also funding for the study from 3M Co.; Medivators Inc., which sells scope cleaning equipment; Healthmark Industries, which provides cleaning products and accessories; and Ofstead & Associates.\nFederal prosecutors, lawmakers and government regulators have been investigating a series of outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" across the country tied to a device known as a duodenoscope, which is used in about 700,000 procedures annually. As many as 350 patients at 41 medical centers worldwide were infected by or exposed to contaminated duodenoscopes from 2010 to 2015, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nRegulators and medical experts have said the complex design of the tip of the duodenoscope can make it difficult to clean even when following the manufacturer's instructions. The infant gas relief drops are used occasionally with duodenoscopes, doctors say, and it's unclear what role, if any, those products might have had on patient infections.\nThis"}

This payment was part of a 2014 sentence.\nHowever, the government believes \"Tonawanda Coke does not intend to make its final community service payment of $2,037,291,\" and is asking for Tonawanda Coke for its financial records.\nLast month, Judge Skretny found Tonawanda Coke guilty of violating its probation by having a higher than acceptable opacity of its emissions.

The engineer also raised environmental concerns.

The guitar is actually an opera singer with a long neck. If you're not making it sing, you might as well go home.\"\nEveryone who loves \"This Is Spinal Tap\" has a story about how many times they've seen it, or how stoned they were when they first saw it, or something. Before a recent screening, the last time I saw \"Spinal Tap\" was in the dentist's chair -- my dentist is one of those progressive types who has kindly installed a video-hookup contraption over the seat of torture. Somewhere between the point at which my tooth was ground down to a nubbly stump and the moment where a temporary crown was popped on with some stinky glue, Spinal Tap lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel babbled on to documentary filmmaker Marti DiBergi about his special amp, the one \"wot goes to 11.\"\nAnd I had to laugh -- but I could only use my eyes.\nThere's really no point to that story, but I told it because it somehow sums up the abstract wonder, and clear genius, of Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary about a heavy-metal band that many fans have grown to love so much they want desperately for it to be real. But for a cult favorite, \"This Is Spinal Tap\" -- which, beginning Friday, will enjoy a theatrical re-release to coordinate with a brand-new special edition DVD -- is surprisingly subtle. You almost can't blame its legions of faithful followers for memorizing huge chunks of it, and for turning many of its jokes (especially that bit about the amp) into permanent fixtures of rock 'n' roll vernacular. How else do you grab hold of \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody that's so close to its target, so spot-on and elusive at the same time, that it almost -- almost -- isn't even funny? How is it that a heavy-metal spoof can be as light as a soap bubble?\nIt's a mystery more baffling than Stonehenge.\nThe band's stage performances in the film are delectably overblown and hugely satisfying, featuring absurdities like checkered Spandex pants and stage props that include giant transparent pods.

Spinal Tap's stage antics cover all the usual heavy-metal clichis -- splayed legs, horrifying Pat Metheny-style facial contortions during guitar solos -- so perfectly that the group's members come off more like real musicians than parodists.

That sounds like good progress, until you consider that it's only about one-third of the 25,000 such space rocks that are thought to zoom around in Earth's neighborhood.\nA near-Earth object (NEO) is anything that comes within about 30 million miles (50 million kilometers) of our planet's orbit. The overall NEO population is almost incomprehensibly large; there are likely tens of millions of such space rocks between 33 feet and 65 feet (10 to 20 meters) in diameter, Johnson said.\nAsteroids of this relatively small size can cause damage on a local scale. For example, the object that exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in February 2013, smashing thousands of windows and wounding more than 1,200 people, measured about 62 feet (19 m) across, scientists have said.\nIn 2005, NASA got some further instructions from lawmakers: Spot 90 percent of all NEOs 460 feet and larger by the end of 2020. It's clear at this point that the agency will not meet that ambitious deadline. And getting such a detailed handle on the NEO population will require the launch of a dedicated asteroid-hunting space mission, according to a& NASA-commissioned study that was published in September 2017.\nThe space telescope for such a mission would ideally set up shop at the sun-Earth Lagrange point 1, a gravitationally stable spot about 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) from our planet, and scan the heavens in infrared light using a telescope at least 1.6 feet (0.5 m) wide, the study found. Such a mission's observations, combined with the contributions of ground-based telescopes, could probably bag the required number of 460-footers in a decade, Johnson said.\nNASA is already working on such a space project \u2014 a concept mission called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam). NEOCam was one of five finalists for the next launch opportunity in NASA's Discovery Program, which funds relatively low-cost and highly focused missions.

They discriminate against us,\" Webster said, referring to his race.\nMaintenance department employees are paid based on what level they are designated.

Despite the difference in pay \u2014 which is about $800 a month \u2014 the work is the same for all four men, Webster and two others familiar with the department said.\nThe workload is divided by each employee being assigned between 15 to 17 schools to take care of, not by the type of job that needs to be done.\nWebster's hope was that he would be able to go before the board and plead his case. He believes he is owed a promotion to level 5, along with back pay for the past three years since taking over the responsibility of driving a truck that was previously driven by a former level 4 employee.\nThe added duty of driving the truck means being responsible for supervising and training the level 2 employee who periodically rides with members of his team, Webster said, along with maintaining the truck and keeping it stocked with supplies. When he took on that role, he inquired about being promoted to level 4 like his predecessor, but it never happened.\nDuring the Thursday board meeting, District 4 Board Member Mary Briers said the board should respect MPS Chief of Staff Kim Gillis and the human resource department's decisions.\nPointing to the size of the system, with about 4,000 employees, Briers said \"if we start second guessing our HR department, we could be here forever.\"\nDistrict 1 Board Member Lesa Keith disagreed. She was the only board member that voted in favor of having the hearing.\n\"Our employees in our system, they have a right to come before the public or us and have their voices heard.

She did not acknowledge the part of his grievance focused on discrimination.\nIn response, Webster wrote to Gillis: \u201cThere is no difference in what we do, that is why I filed a discrimination grievance.

Shane, Conor, Rory and sister Katie as teenagers outwardly answered the call typical of their generation... rock and roll. But, held inwardly, the undeniable inherent gifts of Tommy Makem and of Makem matriarch Sarah awakened during the brothers' college years. The sons of Tommy carry on a tradition born into to them... telling, through song, the stories of their Irish heritage with its roots in the ancient County of Armagh.\nYears ago, Michael Spain introduced his brand of music, Irish folk songs, to bars and clubs in Manchester. He transferred his love for the songs of Tommy Makem to his sons Mick and Liam. When the Makems met the Spains, the connection was strong. The Brothers soon joined together to form an Irish folk band, rich in harmonies and unmatched in musical talent. Among the five, there is a mastery of a dizzying number of instruments; guitar, five string banjo, tenor banjo, bouzouki, mandolin, octave mandolin, bass, flute, concertina, bodhran, whistle, harmonica and more.

The Industrial Revolution concentrated manufacturing power in the hands of capitalist oligarchs, but technology and innovation always finds a way to level the playing field. With the advent of 3D printing, inexpensive electronic components, and other tools, a whole new generation of engineers and builders have started creating in their garages, spare rooms, and backyards.\nWhile some of these creations are small enough to fit in your pocket, other makers go big. Really big. We\u2019re talking working vehicles, giant robots, and other enormous functional structures. In this feature, we\u2019ll spotlight eleven enormous projects that show how epic maker culture can get.\nIf you ask us what technology we want to see in the future, we\u2019ll probably say \u201cgiant fighting robots\u201d before you even finish your question. The team at MegaBots are making our dreams come true with their enormous battling droids, which made their debut at the San Mateo Maker Faire last year. These 15-foot-tall piloted mechs are armed with guns that fire three pound paintballs at 120 miles an hour. That\u2019ll leave a mark! The creators are aiming to make robotic warfare America\u2019s next hot spectator sport, and they\u2019ve already challenged a team in Japan to come up with their own design and meet them on the field of battle.\nThere\u2019s a sizable overlap between the maker community and Burning Man, that yearly desert freakout where odd souls from all over the world converge. Installation art is a major part of the Burning Man experience, and one of the coolest recent pieces we saw came out of maker culture. The Celestial Mechanica is an enormous moving sculpture by Jessika Welz inspired by a scene from The Dark Crystal, where a mechanical model of the solar system ticks away inside an orrery. Welz\u2019s construction boasts 40-foot orbits and a massive propane-powered sun in the middle, burning brightly as its satellites continue their merry rotation.\nThere\u2019s pleasure in creation, true, but there\u2019s nearly as much pleasure in destruction. The robots devised by Bay Area native Justin Gray are some of the most beastly things we\u2019ve ever seen come out of a workshop. Take Boris, pictured above. Built around the chassis of a \u201970s trencher, this beast wreaks havoc on anything in its path using its chain bar and jets of flame. Not all of Gray\u2019s creations are designed for chaos \u2014 his ROEBL unit is designed to be a low-cost remote-controlled loader for farms and other industries.\nOne of the coolest things about maker culture is how designers and builders embrace the fanciful. Take the Aquatrope. There have been plenty of pedal-powered devices in human history, but none quite like this. The device, built by artist Richard Wilks, features an enormous rotating spheroid composed of eight massive discs, each of which is carved with graphics representing our complex relationship with water. They all spin independently, making a visual spectacle that\u2019s incredibly compelling.\nSome of the coolest maker projects are interactive, allowing spectators to express themselves with the device. One of the neatest we\u2019ve seen is Paint By RGB, a massive installation of 2,500 LED lights mounted into a board the size of a wall. Att"}

The history of the medium is relatively short, so influences abound, some more inescapable than others.\nSuch is the case with Violet, the debut feature from Belgian filmmaker Bas Devos, which carries the cinematic DNA of Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park. That latter film \u2013 quiet, enigmatic, haunting \u2013 followed the exploits of bored teenage skaters in America skirting the boundaries of adulthood and the violent trauma of adolescence; Violet focuses on bored teenage BMX bikers in Belgium faced with essentially the same existential drama. The similarities shouldn't be interpreted as a knock of Devos, though \u2013 Van Sant's influence clearly looms large, but Violet acts as more than its own artistic statement.\nAt times alternately surreal, raw and serene, Devos's work will linger just as long as Van Sant's \u2013 a fact that's all the more scarily impressive considering it's his first film.

We played with the device on the show floor, and here are our first impressions.\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet (10.1-inch) released in February 2014 and the Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact released in November 2014 were the predecessors of the Z4 Tablet. The Z3 offers a more compact body and is a hair thicker (6.4 mm vs. 6.1 mm), and the Z4 is 50 g lighter than the Z2 for the same 10.1-inch display size. Just like the previous models, the Z4 is water resistant and dust tight (IP65 and IP68 \u2013 1.5 m submersion) and features a 8.1 MP rear camera.\nThe front shooter has been bumped from 2.2 MP in the Z3 to 5.1 MP, probably to to address the ever growing selfie trend. On the processor side the Xperia Tablet Z4 gets the top of the line octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, a great upgrade from the Snapdragon 801.\nThe Z4\u2019s 10.1-inch 2K display is the star of the show, and a great improvement over the 8-inch WUXGA (1920\u00d71200) display featured in the Z3 Tablet Compact and the Z2 10.1 inch tablet.\nThe battery capacity has been increased from 4500 mAh in the Z3 Tablet Compact to 6000mAh for the Z4, the same capacity found in the Z2 Tablet. This is mainly due to the return to a larger form-factor.\nThe Sony Xperia Tablet Z4 is impressively thin and light, a key feature for a tablet that motivates me to hold it just like another (paper) folder filled with a few documents. The small weight calls for an additional thin keyboard, an accessory that Sony designed greatly, and that provides additional battery life as well. Their compound weight would still be considered as ultra-light.\nAs Sony says, the Xperia Z4 Tablet is surely the thinnest and lightest tablet in the world: the body 6.1 mm thin body weighs only 389 g (WiFi only version) !\nSony maintained the water resistant feature despite the super compact body and even managed to remove the flap cover on the micro USB connector, which is better for the user experience.\nA tablet is a content consumption device and as such the display is a key component for a good user experience. On that side Sony does not disappoint in the Z3, the 2K (2560\u00d71600 ) IPS multi-touch panel delivers a stunning image quality.\nThe IPS technology provides good viewing angles and Sony\u2019s Triluminos technology delivers more vivid colors, two features that enhanced greatly the viewing experience. According to Sony, the display is 40% brighter than the Xperia Z2 Tablet.\nProtect"}

But they buckled in the second half as Kansas, playing just 40 miles from its campus in Lawrence, turned up the pressure.\nThe Jayhawks wound up outscoring North Carolina 49-28 after halftime, sending them into the South Regional semifinals against fourth-seeded Michigan on Friday in Arlington, Texas.\nP.J. Hairston scored 15 points and James Michael McAdoo finished with 11 for the Tar Heels (25-11), who advanced out of the tournament's opening weekend each of the last two years.\nWilliams has always had a fond place in his heart for his former school, but the Southern charmer was booed heavily by the pro-Kansas crowd during pre-game introductions.\nThe barbs didn't quiet in the second half, when things spun out of control for North Carolina and Williams earned a warning from the officials for being outside the coaching box.\nIt was hard to blame him for being frustrated.\nThe 7-foot Withey shut down the paint, forcing the Tar Heels' new-look, four-guard offense into hanging out around the perimeter. And when their perimeter shots quit falling, and the veteran Jayhawks started to get into transition, North Carolina was powerless to stop them.\nKansas has now won at least 31 games four straight years, and improved to 6-1 in games against No. 8 seeds. The Jayhawks have also advanced to the second weekend for the fifth time in six years.\nEven the most loyal fans would have hardly believed it during the first half.\nEverything switched again toward the end of the half, with the Jayhawks clanking just about every shot they put up off the Sprint Center's cold rims, and the up-tempo Tar Heels going on a 14-2 charge that helped them carry a 30-21 lead into the break.\nKansas shot just 25 percent in the first half - just a bit better than the Tar Heels, who went at a 26-percent clip - as the teams combined to miss a staggering 52 shots.\nOnce the second half began, it was all Jayhawks.\nWithey got the crowd inside the Sprint Center stirring with a put-back, and then after the Jayhawks had missed 13 straight 3-pointers to begin the NCAA tournament, Releford hit one from the wing to bring more than 18,000 fans - the vast majority Kansas fans - to their collective feet.\nWithey kept the charge going by driving the lane for a dunk, and then got isolated in the post for another dunk.

The group was introduced by the episode's host, Emma Stone\u2014who's herself a big K-pop fan\u2014and pulled off note-perfect performances of their songs \"Mic Drop and \"Boy With Luv.\"\nBut the appearance was far from the first American history-making moment for the seven-piece band, who\u2019ve been at the forefront of the global explosion of South Korean pop, a style marked by an irresistible fusion of pop, hip-hop, and EDM, all sung largely in Korean. BTS was the first Asian act to win a Billboard Award, and earlier this year became the first K-pop group to serve as presenters at the Grammys. The band's video for \"Boy With Luv\" broke Youtube records by racking up 78 million views just 24 hours after its debut last week. And America's love for BTS is part of a broader trend: After decades of largely ignoring non-English language music, US audiences are listening to international hits more than ever.\nBTS's 2017 album Love Yourself: Tear was only the 5th non-English album to top the Billboard charts, and the only release in that tiny group not sung in a Romance language. Only 17 non-English language songs have ever made it to the American top ten. But that seems to be changing\u2014after a 16 year drought between \"The Macarena\" in 1996 and Psy\u2019s \"Gangnam Style\" in 2012, there were four non-English top ten hits between 2013 and 2018. According to The Guardian, only four Spanish-language tunes landed in the top 100 in 2016, while 19 charted the following year.\nPart of K-pop's American success is due to the advent of social media, which has allowed artists to bypass some of the usual gatekeepers that have historically prevented global music acts from reaching listeners Stateside. And BTS has mastered social media more than any other artist\u2014the band topped Billboard's year-end Social 50 ranking of musicians' social media clout in both 2017 and 2018.\nWhile BTS is the first Korean pop act to gain musical guest status, they\u2019re not the first K-pop artist to appear on SNL\u2014that distinction goes to Psy, who made a cameo at the height of \"Gangnam Style\" mania. That the track and its endlessly watchable music video were satirizing K-pop tropes could easily elude audiences unfamiliar with the genre, and it was sometimes hard to tell whether Western audiences were laughing with or at Psy.\nIn that regard, BTS is making history yet another way: They've cultivated an American audience that treats the group with the same sort of devoted boyband worship that has usually been reserved for groups composed of white, Western men. Members of \"The Army,\" as the group's fanbase is known,\" camped outside NBC for up to a week in hopes of snagging tickets to see BTS perform on SNL.

A.M. Strong\" campaign is a proud sponsor of the Soldier Show which contains three motivational \"I. A.M. Strong\" commercials during each performance, featuring songs written and performed by Soldier/rap artist Sgt. Daniel \"Danny Bee\" Bullock. Soldiers, their family members and Army civilians can also enter a sweepstakes - just visit the SHARP website and complete a survey. After completion, patrons can enter for a chance to win a grand prize vacation at the Shades of Green Resort in Orlando, Fl.\nThe Army Concert Tour consists of six performances between May 29th and September 4th and features such headline acts as Toby Keith, Miranda Lambert and Sammy Hagar. With the help of installation BOSS Soldiers, the \"I. A.M. Strong\" campaign is extremely visible with tents, banners, posters, cards, brochures and T-shirts -- all intended to raise awareness among all patrons and encourage them to intervene, act, and motivate others to prevent sexual assault.\nThe Army's goal is to eliminate sexual harassment and sexual assault from the Army and make the Army sexual assault prevention program a model for the rest of the nation. Leaders must establish a command climate of prevention predicated on mutual respect and trust, that recognizes and embraces diversity, and that values the contributions of all of its members. Above all, leaders at all levels must charge their Soldiers to Intervene - Act- Motivate!\nTo integrate the program across the Army, a SHARP concept plan is currently under review that will provide deployable, government civilian full-time manning down to the brigade level.\nAlso, the Army G-1 has authorized a military training team (MTT) to begin training SHARP personnel in all Army organizations. The MTT has a very aggressive timeline to train over 17,000 personnel between Sept. 10 and Aug. 11.\nAll Army commands, Army service component commands, and direct reporting units have been directed to immediately appoint a command-level SHARP point of contact for the training and ensure all subordinate commands also provide a representative to attend the MTT 80-hour course.\nOpinion: How about a leaner and meaner intelligence system?\n\"This is clearly a long-term endeavor.

{"idx": "20617", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: One of the more important conservative beliefs about Obamacare, running right alongside the certainty that the law is a disaster that will fail in every respect, is the belief that Americans share their antipathy to the law. It certainly is true that the Affordable Care Act has a bad reputation, and the latest poll showing that support for Obamacare has dipped prompted the same wave of conservative gloating that results from every such poll. But looking even an inch beneath the surface reveals a public more frustrated and confused by Obamacare than opposed. Its specific elements poll well, though they\u2019re the least known elements. Four out of ten Americans don\u2019t realize the law hasn\u2019t been struck down. A new poll out shows that the public, by a ten-point margin, trusts Democrats over Republicans on health-care issues. By a 52\u201334 percent margin, they want Congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it. The nearly ubiquitous conservative belief that the public shares its passion for repealing Obamacare is a spate of self-delusion.\nA few conservative lawmakers have speculated that the law will crash so badly that the Democrats will themselves demand repeal in the next couple of years.\nA few Republicans who believe that these effects should not be put off: that Americans should suffer them so as to see the failure of Obamacare with their own eyes. Only then will they turn against the law and its supporters with the requisite passion to undo it.\nPonnuru argues that Republicans must also get serious, finally, about replacing the law with something other than the status quo. But there\u2019s a reason Republicans don\u2019t make repealing Obamacare contingent on an alternative plan: Alternative plans that do anything are hard. People get attached to what they have and suspicious of change. Republicans killed Bill Clinton\u2019s health reform by raising the specter that people who have insurance would get something different, which they didn\u2019t trust. The GOP\u2019s only real health-care traction in the 2012 elections came by assailing Obama for cutting Medicare.\nRepublicans have wisely decided to attack Obamacare without committing themselves to an alternative because the alternative would be easy to attack. Ponnuru, for instance, suggests changing the tax code and stripping regulations to create \u201ca market in which almost everyone would be able to purchase relatively cheap, renewable insurance policies that protected them from the risk of catastrophic health expenses.\u201d Telling tens of millions of Americans they\u2019ll lose their insurance that covers basic medical expenses and get bare-bones policies with thousands of dollars in deductibles is not a winning play.\nThe tiny kernel of truth is that a handful of people \u2014 mostly young, male, and healthy \u2014 will have to buy into some kind of regular insurance plan that covers stuff, not only plans that cover your costs if you\u2019re injured in a car crash and make you pay for just about everything else. The scare campaign could work, at least to some extent. But if it works, it won\u2019t work because Americans are dying to be converted to an all-catastrophic, high-deductible system.\nWhat Republicans have going for them is that health care is really complicated, people don\u2019t spend hours a day boning up on public policy, and those who have insurance understandably fear losing what they have. But the vast majority of the public is not going to see any changes under the new law. Even if the Obamacare exchanges collapse, they only bring in people who don\u2019t have Medicare or employer coverage anyway and are already suffering through a dysfunctional individual insurance market.

Josh Richardson did and missed a three-pointer shortly before the buzzer sounded, dropping the Heat to 2-6 at home.\nMiami entered Saturday night\u2019s game 3-0 when it scored 100 points, but 0-9 when it went into the fourth quarter when it didn't have a lead. Those numbers are now 3-1 and 0-10, respectively.\nThe teams entered the fourth quarter tied at 82 before Conley took over late. The $153 million point guard drove to the basket with two minutes to play, hit a layup and drew a foul on Hassan Whiteside to extend the Grizzlies lead to 105-100. Moments later, Conley buried a three-pointer to extend Memphis\u2019 lead to 108-101 with 1:25 remaining.\nWhiteside finished with 15 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks.

{"idx": "20619", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Why Does God Allow Tragedy and Suffering?\nA preacher reflects on a local mass shooting.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Originally published in 2012, the following is adapted from a sermon preached in response to the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado by author and apologist Lee Strobel on Sunday, July 22, at Cherry Hills Community Church in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.\nIt's already being called the worst mass shooting in American history: 70 people shot by a gunman, 12 of them killed, while they were watching the midnight showing of a new movie. It all happened just 21 miles from where we're sitting. There are no words to describe the anguish being felt by those who are suffering today; our heart and prayers have, and will, go out to them. There are so many tragic stories, so much pain. And many people are asking the question, \"Why? Why did God allow this?\"\nThis has been a heart-rending summer for Colorado. First came the wildfires, which ravaged the houses of hundreds of our neighbors, prompting many of them to ask the same question, \"Why?\"\nAnd those two tragic events are just added to the everyday pain and suffering being experienced in individual lives. There's illness, abuse, broken relationships, betrayal, sorrow, injuries, disappointment, heartache, crime and death. And perhaps you've been asking the question too. \"Why? Why me? Why now?\"\nThat \"why\" question is not a new one; it goes back thousands of years. It was asked in the Old Testament by Job and the writers of the Psalms, and it was especially relevant during the 20th Century, where we witnessed two World Wars, the Holocaust, genocides in the Soviet Union and China, devastating famines in Africa, the killing fields of Cambodia, the emergence of AIDS, the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. And the 21st Century didn't start any better. There was 9/11 and now the Syrian slaughters, and on and on. Why do all of these horrific things happen if there's a loving and powerful God? Why do bad things happen to good people?\nSeveral years ago, I commissioned a national survey and asked people what question they'd ask if they could only ask God one thing. The number one response was: \"Why is there suffering in the world?\"\nMaybe you've never asked why our world is infected with pain and suffering, but my guess is you will when they strike you or a loved one with full force. And Jesus said they are coming. Unlike some other religious leaders who wrote off pain and suffering as mere illusions, Jesus was honest about the inevitability of suffering. In John 16:33 he said, \"You will have suffering in this world.\" He didn't say you might\u2014he said it is going to happen.\nBut why? If you ask me, \"Why did God allow the gunman to spray the Aurora movie theater with gunfire just two days ago?\" the only answer I can honestly give consists of four words: \"I do not know.\"\nI don't have God's mind; I don't share his perspective. In 1 Corinthians 13:12 we're told, \"Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity.\"\nSomeday we'll see with clarity, but for now things are foggy.

Those detainees were released for no other reason than the fact that they no longer constituted a danger to the security of the IDF units currently withdrawing from South Lebanon.\nThe temporary transfer to Israel of detainees who still constitute an immediate and real danger to the security of the IDF became imperative because of material reasons arising from the particular circumstances currently prevailing in South Lebanon. The assertion in the Lebanese letter that such a temporary transfer violates provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 is equally groundless, since the Convention explicitly authorizes such measures \"when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement\" (article 49, second paragraph).\n1.\tKeeping the detainees at Ansar would have complicated and prolonged Israel's ongoing withdrawal from South Lebanon.\n2.\tReleasing the detainees would have added to the instability and bloodshed in South Lebanon and the likelihood of attacks against the IDF troops.\n3.\tBuilding an alternative detention centre capable of providing adequate facilities for those detainees in the area being evacuated was not possible in the time frame of the ongoing withdrawal.\nEfforts are now being made to establish a smaller facility in Majidiyah in South Lebanon designed for holding some of the detainees by the IDF pending its withdrawal from the area.

They are also entitled to petition an Appeals Board, in accordance with Israeli law.

In January 2011, the Chilean-American author Ariel Dorfman wrote about how Mandela expressed concern, in his newly published memoir Conversations With Myself, about being remembered as an otherworldly ethical actor totally separate from difficult, still-unsettled political questions.\nThe end of the racist South African regime is simply inconceivable without the moral capital and charisma Mandela had accumulated during his prison years. As a symbol of dignity and resistance he was, well, irresistible; but the compassion he showed once he was released, the ability to speak to his enemies and bring them to the table, his disposition to forgive (but never to forget) the terror inflicted on him and his people, his willingness to see the good in others, to trust their deepest sense of humanity and honor, turned him into the sort of ethical giant that our species desperately needed in a petty era of devastation and greed. Such a halo can, however, be just as confining as an island where every move and word is guarded.\nLawyers, teachers, ministers, factory workers, trade unionists, liberals and radicals have been exiled, banished, banned, imprisoned. Their voices cannot be heard, and they are prevented from hearing the voices of others. Books in which great men expressed noble ideals throughout the ages are prohibited, to publish the words of any person who is or has been banned is a criminal offense. Criticism is communism, thought is sabotage. South Africa has become a vast and terrifying prison.\nThe Nation, like the rest of the world, more or less lost sight of Nelson Mandela for many years after his imprisonment, as more radical\u2014and more violent\u2014opponents of apartheid came to the fore. But all that time Mandela was accruing support (or \u201cmoral capital,\u201d as Dorfman later put it), and after rejecting at least one offer of release in exchange for unequivocally rejecting violence\u2014Mandela argued that \u201ca prisoner cannot enter into contracts\u201d\u2014he was finally freed in February 1990. After several fits and starts, he entered negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk, struggling to maintain a broad coalition in the ANC while establishing friendly relationships with government figures. To the same extent that Mandela\u2019s immense political gifts enabled him to successfully\u2014and, to a large extent, peacefully\u2014end minority rule and de jure segregation in South Africa, he also struggled to satisfy the disparate elements in fighting for those goals.\nThe sense of disappointment over Nelson Mandela\u2019s statement in Kenya is all the more acute because, though he consorted with heads of state and other important personages elsewhere, he did not seem to lose his bearings. It would be comforting to think that he will reflect on his experience in Nairobi and that he will come to realize that, despite his reluctance to turn his back on the black African leaders who supported his struggle all these years, it is not the likes of Kenya\u2019s Moi, Zaire\u2019s Mobutu, Somalia\u2019s Siad Barre and Eth"}

But it\u2019s still a tragedy.\nIt will be quite some time before we know the outcomes from a host of inevitable lawsuits filed on behalf of those who lost their lives in the Branson duck boat tragedy a few weeks back.\nAnd of course, it will be even longer before those families can get back to some sense of normalcy (if they ever do) in their lives and back to what they would call a regular routine.\nBut much like the fires that have been ravaging California \u2014 as well as a few other states \u2014 this particular tragedy was not a mentally ill person intent on doing harm. This tragedy was not the result of a former employee with a grudge or someone who had pledged allegiance to ISIS and sought to do Americans harm.\nThis local tragedy was born out of what some are calling carelessness or sloppiness, others are calling greed, and others are calling simply a weather event that could have happened at any amusement area in any part of the world if the weather quickly turns bad.\nThis tragedy in our own backyard hits us especially hard, in many ways because it\u2019s a reminder that some tragedies are hard \u2014 if not downright impossible \u2014 to prevent. In fact, there are no terrorists to blame in an incident like this. And while there may or may not be someone or some entity to legally blame, no mentally ill person set out to do others harm.\nIn short, these tragedies are, in some ways, even tougher for us to collectively process because there is no obvious \u201cbad guy\u201d to blame for the senseless ending of life and no enemy to go after in order to pursue justice.\nInstead, this tragedy reminds us that even with the best of intentions, life can go horribly awry in the blink of an eye. After all, Branson, Springfield and most all of the Ozarks are the perfect destination for what should be safe family fun over the summer \u2026 but this time people lost their lives on a short tourist ride that was supposed to be fun and relaxing.\nPerhaps our takeaway as residents of southwest Missouri is that we are a resilient and caring people. Perhaps we learn \u2014 whether a tragedy made by nature or by a crazed gunman \u2014 that we are stronger together. We are stronger when we support those who lost family, whether here in the Ozarks in a duck boat tragedy or somewhere else due to another cause. We join those who are suffering because it\u2019s only through support, care and concern that we heal.\nAnd whether a local accident or a horrific event farther away, may we choose to support healing rather than finger-pointing."}

What would John Paul II say?\nHAVANA\u2014The ripped corner of a faded banner from Pope John Paul II\u2019s 1998 visit to Cuba hangs from a crumbling stone wall in Old Havana. Whether someone hung it anew to herald the visit of Pope Francis this weekend or if it has truly stood the test of time is anyone\u2019s guess, but there is little question that the two papal visits are very different, and the earlier one feels as if it\u2019s from a very distant past.\nWhen John Paul II visited this strange and wonderful island 17 years ago, he kissed a tray of Cuban soil held up by children at his airport ceremony and held Fidel Castro at arm\u2019s length telling him in no uncertain terms that he was there to pray that Cuba would become a land of \u201cfreedom, mutual trust, social justice and lasting peace.\u201d It was a kind of victory lap for the great Cold War crusader against Communism, given credit by many for vanquishing Fidel\u2019s sponsors in the by-then quite defunct Soviet Union.\nThe elder Castro was just as rigid, using his time at the podium to say Cuba was fine just the way it was, thank you. \u201cWe choose a thousand deaths rather than abdicate our convictions,\u201d he told John Paul as a way of greeting.\nNothing could be more different from the welcoming ceremony when Francis landed here on Saturday night, not least because Pope Francis shares many of the convictions that Fidel and Raul officially say they stand for: identifying with the poor, calling for greater income equality.\nOn Friday evening, Francie and Fidel\u2019s younger brother, Cuban President Raul Castro, greeted each other like old friends, embracing in such a warm way one can almost imagine them sitting down over a glass of rum (and a cigar?) in the old city center like old compa\u00f1eros de lucha, comrades in the struggle.\nThis time, Raul welcomed Francis by repeating his gratitude for the pope\u2019s role in thawing relations with Washington. \u201cThe reestablishment of relations has been a first step in the process toward normalization of the relationship between the two countries, which will require resolving problems and correcting injustices,\u201d he said.\nFrancis then asked Castro to greet his ailing brother and \u201cconvey my sentiments of particular respect and consideration\" to Fidel. After delivering his Sunday angelus in Revolution Square, Francis spent about 40 minutes visiting with Fidel at the former leader's private residence in Havana for what Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters in Havana was an \"intimate and familial\" conversation with around 10 people in attendance.\nWithout giving much specific detail, Lombardi said that Castro discussed \"the situation of humanity today, the great problems\" and Castro reminisced fondly about the last papal visit and his conversation with Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. The two then exchanged gifts. Francis gave Castro a series of books and CDS including some by Fidel's former Jesuit tutor. Castro gave the pope a signed copy of a bound interview called Fidel and Religion.\nIt was no secret that John Paul II\u2019s relationship with Castro was strained, but in many ways marked the beginning of a turning point for Cuban Catholics. It was just after Castro had relaxed the rules on religion, turning Cuba from being officially atheist to becoming secular nation. Almost immediately after the visit, Castro reinstated Christmas"}

There was no explanation for the Treasury Department keeping the individual transactions under $100 million.\nThe money settles a dispute over a $400 million payment made in the 1970s by the U.S.-backed shah\u2019s government for military equipment. The equipment was never delivered because of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah and ended diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran.\nOn Jan. 17, the administration paid Iran the account\u2019s $400 million principal in pallets of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency, raising questions about the unusual payment. The $1.3 billion covers what Iran and the U.S. agreed would be the interest on the $400 million over the decades.\nThe deal has faced increased scrutiny since the administration\u2019s acknowledgment this month that it used the money as leverage to ensure the release of four American prisoners.\nPresident Barack Obama and other officials deny such claims, though they\u2019ve struggled to explain why the U.S. paid in cash. President Obama said it was because the United States and Iran didn\u2019t have a banking relationship after years of nuclear-related sanctions, but that wouldn\u2019t rule out using intermediary banks that maintain relationship with both.\nBriefing reporters last week, a senior U.S. official involved in the negotiations said the interest payments were made to Iran in a \u201cfairly above-board way,\u201d using a foreign central bank. But the official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to be quoted by name and demanded anonymity, wouldn\u2019t say if the interest was delivered to Iran in physical cash, as with the $400 million principal, or via a more regular banking mechanism.\nThe money came from a little-known fund administered by the Treasury Department for settling litigation claims. The so-called Judgment Fund is taxpayer money Congress has permanently approved in the event it\u2019s needed, allowing the president to bypass direct congressional approval to make a settlement. The U.S. previously paid out $278 million in Iran-related claims by using the fund in 1991."}

Chelsea chose to remain silent when asked if Arnesen had made any approaches for the youngsters via their agent.\nHowever, they are treating most of the rumours emanating from the under-17 competition in Peru as pure speculation. The current Premiership leaders expected to be linked with a host of youngsters because of the Dane's presence at the tournament.\nFor example, Borussia Dortmund have rejected suggestions that Chelsea are the latest Premiership side to make a bid for starlet Nuri Sahin. The hugely talented midfielder, who has just turned 17, is already a member of Borussia's first team.\nSahin, who has come through the junior ranks at the club, has just returned home from the World Championship in Peru - where he helped his native Turkey to fourth place with a string of impressive performances.\nArsenal have since kept close tabs on his situation and progress while Manchester United and Chelsea are believed to have stepped up their interest.\nBut Hans-Joachim Watzke, Dortmund's managing director, said: \"So far we haven't received an offer yet. He is our future and will soon take the Bundesliga in storm, we don't really plan to sell him.\"\nChelsea's quest to eclipse Arsenal's record of 49 unbeaten Premiership games has been given a further boost by the release of statistics which show the Blues have been more entertaining on their way to 37 matches without defeat.\nAt the same stage during their unbeaten run, Arsenal had scored three goals fewer than Chelsea's total of 82.

Comey in a tweet Friday morning.\nFor a guy who has spent the past week being compared to Richard Nixon for firing a man who was investigating his campaign, it was an odd threat to level. Nixon, of course, was undone in part by the things that he recorded himself saying in the Oval Office. Which raises an interesting question: Do presidents still record those conversations? Does Trump?\nNixon didn\u2019t start the tradition of recording conversations in the Oval Office. That honor belongs to President Franklin Roosevelt, according to a detailed history from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Roosevelt\u2019s system included a microphone hidden in a lamp that connected to a recording device in the basement under the office. He used it to record news briefings, after an incident in which he felt the New York Times misquoted him.\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower had a recording system, too, activated by a button that would turn on a microphone hidden in a fake telephone he kept on his desk. The Post wrote about Eisenhower\u2019s recordings two decades ago, noting that the conversations he chose to tape didn\u2019t seem to have any consistent theme.\nWhen John Kennedy took office in 1961, he increased the number of recording devices, according to the IEEE history, adding microphones behind the curtains in the Cabinet Room and in the White House study. Lyndon Johnson focused on recording telephone calls, include one infamous call in which he ordered some new pants.\nJohnson apparently also asked for daily transcriptions of his conversations that he reviewed. He also increased the number of microphones in the Cabinet room, having a number of microphones installed under the table in the room.\nWhich brings us to Nixon. The Nixon Library details the setup he relied on: seven microphones in the Oval Office, two in the Cabinet room, four in his office in the Executive Office Building and a recording system at Camp David. Few White House employees knew that the system was in place until, of course, the existence of the taped conversations rose to national attention in July 1973 when a staffer revealed their existence to the Senate committee investigating the Watergate break-in.\nHistorian Michael Beschloss notes that this was supposed to be the end of surreptitious recording.\nBut there\u2019s some reason to think that it wasn\u2019t.\nIn 2012, journalist Mark Bowden gave a talk at the Pritzker Military Museum in Chicago about his new book, \u201cThe Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden.\u201d As part of the research for that book, Bowden spent 90 minutes interviewing President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. The interview went well \u2014 until it didn\u2019t.\nThat anecdote speaks volumes about the subject at hand: A recorded, transcribed conversation that was apparently conducted without the subject knowing.\nUpdate: A former official with the Obama White House contacted The Post to incdicate that the transcript provided by Rhodes came from a stenographer in the room during the interview. He added that the Obama administration did not secretly record private meetings. This article has been updated throughout to reflect that statement.\nJournalist Yashar Ali reported Friday morning that, according to a source within the Secret Service, the ability to record conversations in the Oval Office still exists.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, if it does, there\u2019s good reason to think that Trump would embrace its use.\nBuzzFeed has reported several times on alleged use of recording devices by Trump at his homes and properties.

{"idx": "20659", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer wiped the floor with Wall Street's third-quarter estimates, but one comment made by CEO Ian Read during the earnings call suggests weakness on the horizon.\nPharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) dazzled Wall Street once again by reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Wednesday.\nFor the quarter, Pfizer delivered $12.09 billion in revenue, a 2% year-over-year decline, while its reported net income dropped 20% to $2.13 billion from $2.67 billion. Pfizer's EPS dropped a similar 19% to $0.34 from $0.42.\nHowever, these headline numbers include the negative effect of currency movements, as well as the acquisition costs associated with buying Hospira. If we exclude the $1.1 billion in adverse currency effects and other non-recurring expenses, Pfizer's apples-to-apples operations actually grew revenue by 6% on a year-over-year basis -- its fourth straight quarter of adjusted operational growth. Profit per share on an adjusted basis also rose by 5% to $0.60 from $0.57. Wall Street had anticipated just $11.49 billion in total revenue and a mere $0.51 in EPS.\nAdditionally, Pfizer boosted its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.16 to $2.20. For reference, Pfizer lifted its guidance in early September to a range of $2.04 to $2.10 in adjusted EPS. The recent surge in profit expectations for the full year likely has to do with the completion of the Hospira buyout and the official recognition of revenue and profits from its purchase.\nA lot went right for Pfizer in the latest quarter, as evidenced by its substantial profit beat and full-year guidance boost. However, what's most notable is the continued strength in its recently approved breast cancer drug, Ibrance.\nIf you recall, Ibrance was approved in early February by the Food and Drug Administration after nearly doubling the progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients who are estrogen-positive and HER2-negative. The doubling in PFS over the placebo group was extremely encouraging and lent to the idea that Ibrance would become one of the motors that would help drive Pfizer out of its multiyear revenue decline. After two full quarters on pharmacy shelves (and a partial quarter), Ibrance's uptake looks promising. Sales leaped from $38 million in its partial first quarter to $140 million in Q2, and then jumped once more to $230 million in Q3 on a global basis. On an extrapolated basis, it's likely that Ibrance will become a blockbuster drug (i.e., one that generates $1 billion or more in annual sales) by 2016. With the potential for label expansion, Ibrance looks poised to challenge Wall Street's peak annual sales targets of $3 billion-$5 billion.\nPfizer's global oncology division as a whole deserves a nod, too. Ibrance was a substantial reason why the division's sales rose by 54% on an operational basis to $786 million, though operational increases of 18%, 13%, and 10% from Xalkori, Inlyta, and Sutent, respectively, also packed some punch.\nVaccines were also insanely strong for Pf"}

The earth there is a deep, raw red, and the olive trees that punctuate it are green and gray and very old. The cemetery wall is high and long, the same color as the earth, and it is crowned with rough clay tiles.\nTwenty feet or so along the wall from its southwestern corner, there are egg-size gouges in the plastered brick. The marks are impacts from bullets. In the summer of 1936, more than a thousand people were brought to the cemetery in open trucks, day after day, to be shot against the wall by firing squads. American tourists who were staying in the little hotels down the lane later told of their horror at being awakened before dawn by the grinding gears of the trucks as they went uphill, and then, minutes later, hearing the volleys of gunfire. On August 16th, thirty people were shot at the cemetery, while down in the city the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was taken into custody. Two days later, Lorca was murdered, along with two bullfighters and a schoolteacher.\nLorca was handsome and dark-haired, and walked with a curious, flat-footed gait that made him instantly recognizable in Granada, where he had grown up.

But, in what was a conservative, provincial city, the family was also associated with the Spanish Republic and its liberal values; one of Lorca\u2019s sisters was married to Granada\u2019s Socialist mayor, who was among those killed on August 16th. With his 1928 book of poetry, \u201cGypsy Ballads,\u201d and his 1932 play, \u201cBlood Wedding,\u201d Lorca had become Spain\u2019s most renowned poet and dramatist. Among his closest friends were Salvador Dali, with whom he had a turbulent love affair, and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the film director. Lorca had toured Spain since 1931 with his own theatre group, La Barraca, for the Republic\u2019s Ministry of Education. At the age of thirty-eight, and more or less openly gay, Lorca was a highly visible figure with known Republican sympathies. And that, in the Granada of the summer of 1936, was enough to get a person killed.\nOn July 17, 1936, a forty-three-year-old general named Francisco Franco had launched a military rebellion against Spain\u2019s left-leaning government. A cabal of military officers seized control of Granada three days later. In the three-year civil war that ensued, Franco and his ultranationalist Falangists received military assistance from Hitler and Mussolini, and more than half a million Spaniards were killed before the Republic finally succumbed. In April, 1939, Franco formally initiated his dictatorship. It lasted until his death, in 1975.\nA moment later, D\u00edaz cursed. \u201cThey have taken the plaque.

According to the team, Youkilis has a lower back strain. Youkilis was placed on the DL, with catcher Ryan Lavarnway promoted from Pawtucket to take his spot on the active roster.\n\u201cStructurally, I think he came out [of the examination] pretty sound,\u2019\u2019 manager Terry Francona said before the Red Sox\u2019 4-3 win. \u201cTake some time to kind of let that recover. His body was so beat up anyway. This was like the last straw. It just kind of put him over the edge.\nIt has been a rough season for Youkilis, who has missed games with injuries to his left shin, left hip, left ankle, upper back, and right hamstring. Despite the physical issues, he is hitting .266 with 17 home runs and 78 RBIs.\nFrancona said he was hopeful Youkilis would return after 15 days, which would make him eligible Sept. 2.\nWhen Clay Buchholz went on the disabled list June 19 with a lower back strain, it was not expected to be a long-term problem. He has not played since.\nOrtiz \u2018a little better\u2019 David Ortiz reported to the clubhouse wearing a black medical boot to take pressure off the bursitis in his right heel.

That would put him out 7-9 days.\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping that will knock it out,\u2019\u2019 Francona said.\nFrancona said having Ortiz and Youkilis out of the lineup is a problem, but not an excuse.\nRoyal treatment Mike Aviles started at shortstop in place of Marco Scutaro. Aviles was drafted by the Royals in 2003, made his major league debut in 2008, and played in 301 games for Kansas City before being traded to the Red Sox July 30 for Yamaico Navarro and a minor league pitcher.\nUntil yesterday, Aviles had never been in the visitors\u2019 clubhouse at Kauffman Stadium.\nAviles said the Red Sox have made him feel a part of the team since the day he arrived.\nAviles received some applause from the crowd when he came up in the third. He singled to center and scored.\nScutaro was out for the fifth straight game because of a sore back, but he hopes to play today.\nAs for Navarro, he played two games for the Royals before being sent to Triple A Omaha, where he is hitting .205.\nCrawford scuffling Carl Crawford was in an 0-for-15 slump with eight strikeouts before hitting a leadoff single in the fourth inning.

Feds say Reynolds lied about having cancer.\nIt looks like prosecutors weren't the only ones miffed by former Clinton Township Trustee Dean Reynolds' story of having cancer.\nA day after federal prosecutors wrote a scathing memo accusing Reynolds of lying about having cancer in an effort to get bond, his attorney asked to withdraw from the case.\n\"There has been a breakdown in the attorney/client relationship to the extent that said relationship cannot continue,\" attorney Stephen Rabaut wrote in a Friday filing in U.S. District Court.\nProsecutors also said Reynolds lied to his lawyer and the judge about his mother being in hospice care, and urged his father to help him cover up the fact that she was really in the hospital. Rabaut didn't get into specifics in his request to withdraw beyond saying he couldn't represent him anymore.\nIn his filing, Rabaut said that he met with Reynolds on Thursday at the St. Clair County Jail to discuss the breakdown of their relationship. He also wrote that he discussed the issue with the government and that prosecutors don't object to his request to be off the case.\nMeanwhile, the judge granted the government's wishes to deny bond to Reynolds, who was ordered immediately jailed in June after a jury convicted him on 14 bribery counts for his role in a widespread corruption scandal. Reynolds asked to be released on bond, saying he had kidney cancer and needed to be with his dying mother, who he said was in hospice.\nBut the prosecution said none of that was true, noting the FBI listened to hundreds of Reynolds' jail phone calls which, they said, contradicted his claims.\nIn denying Reynolds bond, the judge made no mention of the fake-cancer allegations, stating only that he saw no reason to change his mind about bond.\n\"The court sees nothing new presented in defendant\u2019s request for reconsideration, and nothing that would change its conclusion that defendant\u2019s bond was properly revoked,\" U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland wrote in his Friday order.\nReynolds' bond was revoked after the government argued he was considered a flight risk given that he was facing 20 years in prison for his bribery crimes.\nReynolds was targeted in a widespread federal corruption probe that started in Macomb County, took down a trash empire and charged 18 people with various crimes. He was accused of taking bribes that included cash, a free divorce lawyer and a trip to Disney World and was the first person to stand trial in the probe that has netted more than a dozen guilty pleas and the sentencing of former trash kingpin Charles Rizzo Jr.\nReynolds is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 25 in Port Huron."}
{"idx": "20666", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: BAGRAM AIR FIELD, Afghanistan (AP) - The traumatic brain injury that Army Staff Sgt. Isidoro Castillo suffered when a suicide bomber attacked his unit in Afghanistan could have meant the end of his deployment.\nInstead, Castillo's doctors handled his injury without sending him back to the United States, part of a military effort to better treat and track brain injuries that have become a signature affliction of the war.\nCastillo, originally from Fayetteville, N.C., described the bombing days later while he was recovering in a new specialized housing unit for soldiers being treated for brain injuries.\n\"He was in my peripheral vision. I heard a pop and I hit the ground and the explosion went off,\" Castillo said. Five soldiers from his 18-member mentoring team were killed during an April meeting with Afghan soldiers at an outpost in the eastern province of Nangarhar.\nThe Army has had to rethink the way it deals with traumatic brain injury in Afghanistan and Iraq because U.S. soldiers often are targeted by roadside or suicide bombs. Not treating the sometimes hard-to-spot injury can lead to physical and emotional problems that linger long after the soldier returns home. But sending troops out of country for treatment can leave battle units short-handed.\nMedical evacuations from combat zones for traumatic brain injury have been growing, from 194 in 2008 to 303 in 2010, according to statistics provided to The Associated Press from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. Last year, the military implemented a strict new policy on treating and tracking soldiers with concussions right on the front lines of war.\nMedical officers in Afghanistan say the new approach, which required opening seven new rehabilitation centers called Level II clinics throughout Afghanistan, is allowing more soldiers to go back to their units rather than be evacuated for treatment. Soldiers who are sent home for treatment generally don't come back.\nCastillo was treated under the new guidelines. After diagnosis in the field, he was sent to the rehabilitation clinic the 101st Airborne Division set up at Bagram Air Field for about a week before returning to his unit.\nOn the hot and dusty military base, Castillo had his own room in a cool, quiet housing unit near the hospital, where he could watch movies on a flat-screen TV, play video games or toss a volleyball around on the sandy court outside. Medical crews use these leisure activities combined with military fitness tests, such as running with body armor or maneuvering around obstacles, to determine whether the soldier is fit to return to duty.\nThe clinics are also stocked with card games and Wii video games, which help occupational therapists look for memory loss or balance issues.\nCastillo and other soldier patients meet daily with doctors and have dedicated occupational therapists who monitor symptoms like concentration, balance, headaches and dizziness. The care they are receiving in Afghanistan is similar to TBI rehabilitation programs at military hospitals in the U.S.\n\"It makes you feel like the stress is gone,\" Castillo said. \"You have nothing to think about but how am I going to get better, what's my next appointment. They just let you breathe.\"\nClinics that opened last year in eastern Afghanistan returned about 1,000 soldiers to their units, said Maj.

Hence, it is natural that users will look to move to LTE sooner than later. This makes it essential for all service providers to offer LTE services. However, with all the advantages that LTE has in store for the users, the technology presents several challenges to the operators, who need to address the business challenges of migrating to LTE. This is especially relevant in the case of the smaller carriers (Tier II and Tier III) for whom the hardware setup and operational costs of offering LTE services would be more demanding financially compared to the larger players.\nHaving the EPC in a cloud, which could be shared by several small carriers, will help to reduce the capital investment and operational expenditure. By not hosting the EPC themselves, the smaller carriers do not have to incur the infrastructure expenses and will also not have to address the network maintenance and management issues. This means that several operators will turn to the Cloud based Hosted Services to minimize the risk while migrating to providing LTE services. This will further enable the operator to scale up the services seamlessly.\n\u201cOur focus with the NetEPC\u00a9 has always been the small service providers and in keeping with this we decided to optimize the software for a cloud based deployment\u201d, said Aditya Saraf, VP, Sales and Marketing. \u201cThe Polaris NetEPC\u00a9 has been tested on different virtualized environments like VMware, Virtual Box etc. It has also been demonstrated successfully on Amazon EC2 Infrastructure as a Service. As part of our services, we shall also make the NetEPC available on the hosted service providers\u2019 private cloud, if necessary. Going forward we plan add load balancing /management software which will allow the EPC to scale based on dynamic load conditions\u201d.\nApart from the NetEPC\u00a9, Polaris also has a range of Test and Measurement tools for LTE which are used by leading vendors for pre-deployment testing and evaluating the performance and stability of the network nodes.\nPolaris will be demonstrating the NetEPC\u00a9 as well as the LTE Test Solutions at the CCA Global Expo which is to be held in New Orleans from April 17-19, 2013.\nPolaris Networks is a leading provider of Test tools and Carrier-grade software solutions for LTE. These solutions are used world-wide by equipment manufacturers and operators.

He's under team control through next season, while Sanchez, who's been limited to just 28 starts over the past two seasons, is under team control through 2021.\nPhillips told First Up on TSN Radio 1050 Toronto on Monday that even if Stroman and Sanchez pitch well this season, the Blue Jays are unlikely to be in position to compete for a playoff spot and he believes they would be best off dealing the two starters.\nTSN baseball analyst Steve Phillips joins First Up with Michael and Carlo to discuss Blue Jays spring training, the home opener, lack of ticket sales, the possibility of trading Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez, Devon Travis' injury and more.\n\"I don't think this year [the Blue Jays are] going to be as competitive and I think that the best thing for the Blue Jays, and best thing for Stroman and Sanchez, is that those two guys pitch well,\" Phillips said. \"Because then it opens up the door to a multitude of options. If they pitch well, then the organization can consider signing them to an extension and the players get a payday. If they pitch well and the Jays decide we're not going to lock them up, we're going to trade them, then the players get traded to a team that's probably in a pennant race that may have some financial flexibility that may give them that sort of payday in the future. So, I think it opens up doors for both sides.\n\"Even if Stroman is great in that first four months, he's also been the guy that had a 5.5 ERA last year. He's been the guy that's had some shoulder issues and I just don't see that he is a long-term part of it. And for Sanchez, as well, it's hard to see where a deal would make sense because he's been hurt so much that, unless it's a bargain basement for the team, they probably don't make the deal and Sanchez probably waits and plays it out too.

It is currently found mainly in southwest Florida.\nBetween 2004 and 2013, 190 individuals ranging in total length from 67.1 centimetres to 3.81 metres were sampled, tagged, and released in the Caloosahatchee River, Peace River and Ten Thousand Islands regions.\nRoutine testing of the fish's DNA showed several markers that would normally contain a lot of variability were homozygous, or contained the same DNA sequence, says lead author Andrew Fields, a doctoral student at Stony Brook University's School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.\n\"We were conducting routine DNA fingerprinting of the sawfish found in this area in order to see if relatives were often reproducing with relatives due to their small population size,\" says Fields.\n\"What the DNA fingerprints told us was altogether more surprising: female sawfish are sometimes reproducing without even mating.\"\nSeven of the sample fish -- or 3 per cent -- were found to be produced through parthenogenesis.\nVertebrate parthenogenesis is thought to occur when an unfertilised egg absorbs a genetically identical sister cell.\nThe resulting offspring have about half of the genetic diversity of their mothers, so the genetic diversity of the wild population is reduced, says Fields.\nParthenogenesis is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrate animals, the researchers say in the paper.\nFields says this unusual reproductive process has been known to occur in captive animals, including birds, reptiles, and sharks who gave birth despite the fact that they'd had no opportunity to mate.\nThe 'virgin birth' smalltooth sawfish are all female and appeared to be healthy and the appropriate length for their age, which was estimated around one year.\nFields says this suggests individuals produced in this way can survive in the wild. Previously it was thought these offspring would be unviable.\nThe discovery suggests that parthogenesis does occur \"at a low frequency in nature\", says Fields.\n\"We normally do not see it because females mate and then there is no chance for this process to occur,\" he says.\n\"However when individuals are at low density -- for example endangered or in an aquarium by itself -- and cannot find a mate, maybe parthenogenesis has the opportunity to take place.\"\nUse these social-bookmarking links to share First 'virgin birth' fish found in the wild."}

The turnout was the worst in France for 50 years, and the indications are that the majority of those who stayed at home were Socialist voters.\nFar from being a rightwing \"tsunami\", the election results were more akin to the effect of a vacuum, with the rightwing parties simply pouring into the hole left by disillusioned leftwing non-voters. There may be a partial exception to this in the case of the National Front, which under Marine Le Pen has shown considerable tactical shrewdness in its choice of urban targets and assiduous cultivation of local activists. But it is going too far to suggest, as she does, that France now has a three-party system. First, the Front's victories were mostly Clochemerle triumphs in little towns. Second, all that the Front has done in recent years is to demonstrate that it can run up toward what seems still to be its fixed limit of between 15% and 20% of the vote. In municipal votes, it can take a few cities, and then lose them, as it did in the 90s, through a combination of extremism and incompetence.\nIt will face the same test with its trophies this time, and may well once again fail it. We will only know whether the Front has burst through the line between being a nuisance and being a real player when France votes in parliamentary and presidential elections in 2017. The mainstream right will face a similar challenge in providing good local governance in the many more places in which it suddenly finds itself in power. The right in France does not have a good story at the moment, offers only vague or unconvincing alternatives to Socialist party policies, and has serious leadership problems. The French remember, too, how Nicolas Sarkozy also pledged reform and economic growth and then delivered less than he had seemed to promise.\nMr Sarkozy became the least popular president in recent history, until he lost that title to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Their similar position suggests that France has structural political problems which transcend party differences. One is, as elsewhere in Europe, the near impossibility of combining austerity with a defence of the social state. Another, especially marked in France, is the readiness of citizens in principle to embrace necessary reforms but a refusal in practice to support them when they touch on established rights and privileges.\nJust as Mr Sarkozy did, Mr Hollande has made some progress in changing the ways of both employees and employers. The responsibility pact he persuaded employers and unions to sign, if it genuinely brings jobs, something yet to be proved, could change things for France. But so far unemployment has gone up not down, and growth has been minimal.\nThere remains the question of personality. Mr Hollande has sometimes gained from being seen as rather more normal than most leading politicians, but has as often lost by being tagged as vague and indecisive.

The capability will help women keep track of when their cycle occurs, as well as the frequency and severity of their symptoms, like cramps or headaches. Several existing apps serve similar purposes, but Fitbit wanted to make it possible for women to view this data in the same place as their other health stats.\nFitbit is enriching its interface for viewing health data on the wrist as well. The Fitbit Versa\u2019s new dashboard view includes info that wearers could previously access only in Fitbit\u2019s smartphone app, such as exercise summaries, resting heart rate trends over time, and wellness tips. Fitbit plans to add more features this year that can remind wearers to take their medication at specific times during day, congratulate wearers for completing fitness-related challenges, and allow them to log their meals.\nUpdates like menstrual cycle tracking and the redesigned dashboard will also be coming to the Fitbit Ionic in a software upgrade, the company says. The Versa will also include many of the health features Fitbit introduced in previous products, like its PurePulse heart rate monitor, a virtual coach that guides wearers through exercises, various exercise modes and more. But the Versa does not have a built-in GPS sensor like the Ionic; it uses your phone\u2019s GPS to track your runs and other outdoor workouts.\nFitbit\u2019s app store is still far behind Apple\u2019s when it comes to selection: Fitbit offers more than 550 apps from companies like Starbucks, Yelp, and Nest, while the Apple Watch had thousands of apps in 2015. But Fitbit does offer some worthwhile advantages. Its newest smartwatch is less expensive than the Apple Watch, it works across both iOS and Android devices (unlike Apple\u2019s smartwatch), and Fitbit claims it can last for four days on a single charge, whereas the Apple Watch usually needs to be charged nightly.

But the annual \"upfront\" advertising market, when marketers place their orders for commercial spots for the coming year, was unexpectedly weak.\nBroadcast networks ABC, CBS and Fox collectively booked $600 million less this summer than during last year's market, according to estimates by network executives and analysts.\nCable network executives also struggled to find buyers for their commercial time.\nAnalysts have speculated on various causes, citing the migration of advertising dollars to the Internet and a retrenchment by two major advertisers. Others might be on the sidelines gambling that prices will be lower later in the year.\n\"The broadcast networks took the biggest hit, but cable networks also had trouble getting to their goal,\" said Ed Papazian, president of Media Dynamics Inc., which has analyzed the TV ad market for more than 30 years. \"The marketplace is down; advertisers are being more cautious.\"\nNew Jersey based Media Dynamics estimated that broadcast and cable networks accepted $18.1 billion in prime-time commitments during this summer's upfront market, a 6% decline from last year's total of $19.3 billion. The annual auction held in June and July is called the upfront because advertisers place their orders in advance of the new fall season.\nDeclining ratings at Fox, ABC and cable channels TBS, TNT and MTV contributed to the lower hauls. A Cowen & Co. media analyst Wednesday downgraded stocks of 21st Century Fox, Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., in part, because of declining ratings.\n\"Advertising trends clearly worsened in the second quarter,\" Cowen media analyst Doug Creutz wrote in his research report. \"While we do not necessarily believe recent softness signals the start of something more serious, our caution level has increased.\"\nNot everybody took it on the chin during the upfront market.\nNBC increased its haul for next season by $750 million, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke said during parent company Comcast's earnings call Tuesday. The peacock network came roaring back to life during the just-ended TV season after a decade in the ratings cellar. NBC was able to hike its ad rates 8% during the upfront market, Burke said.\nTwo major sporting events \u2014 the Sochi Winter Olympics in February and this summer's FIFA World Cup in Brazil \u2014 also soaked up more than $1.5 billion in advertising dollars this year, leaving fewer dollars in the upfront market.\nNBCUniversal took in $1.1 billion in ad revenue for its broadcasts of the Olympics. Advertisers sometimes adjust their budgets to save money following a big expenditure, such as the Olympics.\nFor example, Spanish-language Univision Communications, which took in $174 million in ad revenue for its World Cup broadcasts, said that it expects third-quarter advertising to be lower than its second quarter because some advertisers spent big on the World Cup \u2014 and that money has to come from somewhere.\nMedia Dynamics' Papazian said major sporting events, including the World Cup, wouldn't entirely account for the current softness.\nIn a nutshell, he said, \"this year, the demand was low.\"\nRandy Falco, another 30-year veteran of TV advertising and chief executive of Univision, agreed.\n\"Advertisers see they have more options now than they ever have had in the past,\" Falco said.\nUnivision and its main"}

Anyone who's visited the pools is aware of both the beauty and the smell, but even veterans can appreciate the photos' meditative effect.\nYellowstone's thermal pools and mudpots are accessed via raised walkways, often just inches above the water's surface, allowing Reichert to get right over the hyper-color dance of liquid and minerals.\n\"You're right there in the thick of it: improbably lurid, bubbling fields of algae and muck,\" says Reichert.\nAs much as the natural show is a treat for the eyes, it can abuse the nose. Hydrogen sulfide, which has the odor of rotten eggs, rises deep from within the Earth and pervades at the hot springs and mudpots.\n\"When the wind is in the right (wrong?) direction, the smell can be overpowering,\" Reichert told WIRED via email. He describes himself as an environmentalist by nature and lives in the Santa Fe National Forest with his family, a mile from their nearest neighbor.\n\"Surrounded by a forest, and sharing our property with all sorts of wildlife, it's only natural that we would be concerned with the health and preservation of the environment,\" says Reichert.\nPrior to his move to New Mexico, Reichert spent his younger days in New York City. When he left the bustle of the Big Apple in the early '80s he also left behind his darkroom. What followed was a two-decade hiatus from producing photographs for public audiences.\nThe birth of a daughter in 1998 and the awesome Western landscapes reignited Reichert's latent passion. In 2004, Reichert got his first digicam and a couple of years later bought a camera that accommodates his old lenses at the field of view for which they were designed. With old skills he sees the world with fresh eyes.\n\"My photography is for me. It's my way of sorting things out. If it works for others, that's just icing on the cake,\" he says."}

The website presents photo galleries as well as articles showing his personal life and views on different issues.\nFollowing the launch of the podcast, political scientist Sirote Klampaiboon pointed out that Thaksin remained one of the few living Thai ex-PMs who remained popular among a section of Thai people.\nAnother political scientist from Rangsit University, Wanwichit Boonprong, also said that Thaksin was showing his superiority via the podcast, and it would lead to people make comparisons between him and the ruling junta and the pro-junta Palang Pracharat Party.\nThis move will force the pro-junta camp to come out and criticise the former PM, he said. But at the same time, all eyes would also be on Thaksin and his move via his website and the podcast, he added.\nAside from direct competition with the ruling junta, Wanwichit also viewed the launching of the podcast now, with the elections fast approaching, as proof that Thaksin was ready to fight.\nIf some parties or political groups get involved, Wanwichit said they might risk getting dissolved because the charter prohibits outside influence.\nHowever, another way to look at it is that Thaksin may want the dissolution to happen to add fuel to the fire. He may expect his supporters to take to the streets and fight the ruling junta, Wanwichit observed."}

But his views on foreign policy, and particularly the Middle East, appear to be in lockstep with his staunchly pro-Israel backers, including the casino-owning billionaire who is one of Gingrich\u2019s most generous supporters.\nLas Vegas Sands Corporation chairman Sheldon Adelson is likely to open his wallet anew for Gingrich, already telling friends he\u2019ll do what he can to make sure the surging GOP presidential candidate has the money to succeed. The largesse would follow years of Adelson\u2019s generosity to Gingrich\u2019s political and nonprofit efforts that included seven-figure checks to the political think tank that returned Gingrich to the policy arena after his fall from House speaker in the late 1990s.\nAdelson\u2019s office refused to comment on Gingrich. \u201cMr. Adelson\u2019s thoughts on politics and elections are his personal views and he prefers not discussing them publicly,\u201d it said.\nAdelson is a whale of a donor, listed by Forbes as the eighth-richest man in America with a net worth of $21.5 billion, and his company controls the Venetian, the Sands, and the Palazzo along the Vegas Strip, as well as three gambling resorts in Macao. He also owns his own share of controversy. His company acknowledged earlier this year that it is under federal investigation as to whether it ran afoul of federal anti-bribery laws in its dealings in Asia.\nAnd Adelson\u2019s support for Israeli causes here and abroad has, from time to time, garnered headlines, too, like the time he started a newspaper from scratch in Israel that has backed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nAn Israeli-American friend of Adelson, who also advises Netanyahu, recounted Adelson\u2019s role but would speak to The Daily Beast only on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to speak on behalf of the prime minister.\nIn 2006, Adelson launched a newspaper called Israel Today, or Israel Hayom. It was to be a high-end product, not a cheap tabloid. But it was also to be less critical of Netanyahu.\nAt first, he had trouble selling ads. \u201cSo,\u201d the person close to Netanyahu said, \u201cSheldon said, \u2018Screw it, lets just give it away for free!\u2019\u201d The formula worked: it\u2019s now the most widely distributed paper in Israel.\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition brings together influential Jewish fundraisers.

Yet, the magnitude of the losses and especially the recovery are being calculated daily. Indeed, Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently claimed: \"As we look back on the past decade, and as the picture of what has happened here comes into sharper focus, I believe the re-birth and revitalization of Lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the greatest comeback stories in American history.\"\nOther aspects of the impact of the tragedy also can be measured. Here we use demography to look at the victims, the neighborhood and the financial businesses -- the so-called FIRE or Finance, Insurance and Real Estate, sector -- to gauge the magnitude of the loss and extent of the recovery from 9/11 for Manhattan and the city. As we will see though Lower Manhattan has come back in certain respects, Manhattan no longer accounts for over half of all employment in the FIRE sector. Perhaps, this is not surprising given the magnitude of the attack.\nInformation provided by the medical examiner and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and unearthed by the New York Times helped fill in the picture of this unprecedented catastrophe. Census information on businesses and those working in lower Manhattan before the attack throw into high relief the stark dimensions of the direct toll.\nAll of New York City and the United States lived through the attack, but those who died came from very narrow slivers of space, both actual and socio-economic. Indeed, more than two thirds of the 2,753 victims, or at least 1,946, died on the upper floors near or above where the planes crashed: the top 19 floors of the North Tower and the top 33 floors of the South Tower. When one adds the firefighters (343), police and other rescue workers (about 90) and the victims from the two planes (157), one has accounted for almost 90 percent of all victims.\nThe bond trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees; Marsh and McLennan, an insurance firm, 295; Aon, another insurance firm, 176; Fiduciary Trust International, a financial firm, 87; the Port Authority, 75; Windows on the World Restaurant, 73; Carr Futures, a brokerage firm that is now part of Newedge, 69; Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, a security brokerage firm, 67; and equity analysts Sandler O\u2019Neil and Partners, 67.

Risk magazine, the trade bible of the derivatives industry, which defined much of finance in the last two decades, was having a conference at the top floor restaurant Windows on the World. Everyone in attendance, including many high executives, perished.\nGiven the firms for whom many of those in the World Trade Center worked, as well as the large number of firefighters and other rescue workers, the other demographic facts should not be that surprising. The victims were overwhelmingly male (about 75 percent), young (many under 40, most under 50) and white (about 75 percent).

Or did the early practitioners of farming migrate, carrying their technology with them, and displace native hunter-gatherers? In the American Southwest, at least, a tentative answer may be in hand, stored in some of the most banal artifacts held by Harvard\u2019s Peabody Museum: prehistoric wads of chewed leaves called \u201cquids,\u201d and thong-like \u201caprons,\u201d fashioned from shredded juniper bark, stained with what is presumed to be menstrual blood.\nIn an unusual cross-disciplinary collaboration funded by the provost\u2019s office, the museum\u2019s director of collections, Steven LeBlanc, teamed with Harvard Medical School\u2019s Thomas Benjamin, a research professor in pathology whose lab normally studies mouse cancer, to recover DNA thousands of years old from the artifacts. They focused on mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child for generation after generation, and which exists in a thousand copies per cell, and extracted it successfully from about a quarter of the quids they sampled, and from a smaller fraction of the aprons. What they found in their small sample from an early corn-growing culture suggests that in this part of the New World, at least, migrating Uto-Aztecans from Mexico probably did not pass their technology to the indigenous hunter-gatherers, but instead out-reproduced and replaced them.\nLeBlanc says this theory\u2014that farmers spread north from central Mexico\u2014was advanced by Peter Bellwood of Australian National University in a controversial 2005 book, First Farmers. \u201cBellwood argues that this is a worldwide pattern of how farming spreads: by migration, not diffusion,\u201d he explains. There were exceptions: places where \u201cthe foragers were either dense enough or close enough socially and technologically to the farmers that they were able to adapt. In Europe, it looks like the Basques are an example, and Scandinavia is an example,\u201d LeBlanc says. Different geographical conditions\u2014high altitude, or cold climates not conducive to growing crops\u2014may have momentarily checked the farmers\u2019 advance, giving hunter-gatherers on the other side of the pause line a chance to react. In the American Southwest, he notes, there is a Zuni-speaking population on the Arizona-New Mexico border that took up corn farming without being swamped by an Uto-Aztecan influx.\nLeBlanc describes his study as \u201cone little piece of a very large chain of investigation,\u201d but the work has nevertheless demonstrated the efficacy of using DNA analysis on objects held in museums. \u201cThe FBI does it all the time,\u201d he says, \u201cbut archaeologically, this is the first time that anybody has ever done such a thing.\u201d The earliest artifact LeBlanc and Benjamin studied was about 2,400 years old; whether the methodology is directly transferable to answer similar questions in Europe, for example, where farming\u2019s spread began thousands of years earlier, remains unknown. An answer will also depend on what sorts of objects have been saved from excavations there."}

But in Shanghai, such families will now be actively encouraged to use what was previously seen as a privilege.\n\"We just hope more people can have a second child because for Shanghai, as a city which started family planning quite early, the process of ageing is fast,\" said Zhang Meixin of the Shanghai population and family planning commission. \"If eligible couples have two children, it might help to relieve the pressure.\"\nHe said the authorities would not introduce new policies as such and stressed that the nationwide rules still stood. Officials have long feared that China cannot support a rising population \u2013 already over 1.3 billion and not expected to peak until it reaches 1.5 billion in about 2033.\nThe change reflects the differing needs of China's modern cities and its countryside, and growing acknowledgement by officials that birth restrictions are a blunt tool with unwanted side-effects.\nEarlier this year the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies warned that China would have more than 438 million over-60s by 2050. Each would have just 1.6 working-age adults to support them, compared with 7.7 in 1975.\nThe problem is particularly acute in Shanghai. Zhang said its fertility rate was 0.88 in 2008 \u2013 far below the national average of around 1.8 \u2013 and that which is needed simply to keep the population at the same level.\nFertility rates tend to drop with economic development. China's is still above that of Britain and many European countries.\nXia Xueluan, a professor of sociology at Peking University, said family planning had many advantages, but applauded the new policy. \"They should have done this earlier, and it should be promoted all over the country, not just in Shanghai.\"\nBut he added that additional incentives \u2013 such as child benefit \u2013 may be necessary to persuade urbanites to have more babies.\nBut while rural dwellers in particular chafe at restrictions and heavy-handed enforcement \u2013 which has included forced abortions \u2013 many in cities are used to the policy and seem largely indifferent, or like the idea of increasing their families but worry about the financial impact.\nResentment is often sparked by the variation in the policing of the rules rather than the law per se \u2013 with many complaining that the rich are unaffected by fines that can cripple poorer households.\n\"I don't want a second child. One is enough, and I hope it is a girl, said expectant mother Yu Nan, 25. \"It is very nice to be the only child; you don't need to share or grab things from others.

{"idx": "20714", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Wireless doorbells are available that allow you to install a doorbell and button without running wires. Many doorbells offer you the opportunity to change the chime tones. Currently, the chime tone on your wireless doorbell might only ding a one-note tune, or it might produce a ding-dong two-note tune. It could be capable of much more, though. Your doorbell might have other chime tones, such as an eight-note Westminster, or odd noises, such as a foghorn or gong. If your doorbell has this option, you can change the tones to something more entertaining.\nRemove the decorative cover from your wireless chime by unsnapping it from the doorbell base. Some wireless doorbell brands are single-piece units that mount on the wall. If you have a single-piece wireless doorbell, remove it from the wall and turn it face down on your work surface.\nLook for the pin-setting jumpers on the front of the door bell base, or look for a small door covering the jumpers on the back of the doorbell base you removed from the wall. The pin-setting jumpers are eight double pins, numbered one through eight, surrounded by jumpers that look like two U-shaped pieces of black plastic connected with a piece of metal. When you install a jumper around both pins, it creates an electrical connection. After you locate the pin-setting jumpers on the doorbell base, locate the pin-setting jumpers on the doorbell push button.\nPush a small, slotted screwdriver into the small opening in the bottom of the doorbell push button. Push the screwdriver against the tab inside the opening. Lift the cover from the doorbell push button. Remove the battery from the doorbell push button to access the pin-setting jumpers.\nFind the jumper pins numbered as seven, eight and nine. Note how the jumpers fit over both pins. Use needle-nose pliers to slide the jumpers off these pins on both the doorbell push button and the doorbell base. Slide one jumper back onto pin number eight, making sure the jumper slides over both of the number eight pins on the doorbell base. Slide one jumper onto pin number eight on the push button. Do not replace the jumpers on pins seven or nine. This will change the chime tone. Be aware, not all wireless doorbell brands will have the same jumper pin configuration to create different chime tones.\nExperiment with different configurations of the three jumpers on both the doorbell button and the doorbell base until you are satisfied with the chime tone. For example, you can leave the jumpers off pins seven and eight, only placing a jumper onto pin nine to create a different tone. Make sure the jumper pins on the doorbell base and button match.\nSnap the decorative cover over the wireless doorbell base or hang the single piece unit on the wall. Replace the battery in the doorbell button and snap on the cover.\nSome wireless doorbells have a chime-tones select button on the face of the doorbell base. Push the button, and the chime tones sounds. Continue to push the button until you hear your desired chime tone, replace the cover and your chime tone is changed.\nHarsch, Cecilia. \"How to Change Chime Tones on a Wireless Doorbell.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/change-chime-tones-wireless-doorbell-37948.html. 27 December 2018."}

{"idx": "20716", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This summer I made the unconventional decision for a Film & TV major and accepted an internship that was \u201ctechnically\u201d a Public Relations internship. I spent my summer as a Social Media Intern for Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\nEvery time someone in the office asked me what my major was they would expect me to say \u201cCommunications\u201d or \u201cPR.\u201d They were even more surprised when they found out that what I actually wanted to do in Television was to write and produce for comedies.\nSo why did I do it?\nI, like many others in the industry, have noticed just how Social Media has taken the world by storm. Every single show you see on television has a twitter or Facebook or instagram or all of the social media platforms. I also had done social media for COM and for some groups on campus so I had enough experience to get the job in the first place.\nCurrently, there are no classes for Film & TV that really focus on social media so I knew that this opportunity would expand my knowledge base and understanding. And isn\u2019t that what internships are for in the first place??\nSo what did I learn?\nI learned A TON. Don\u2019t fret- I DID get to go on shoots and actually help film a lot of the videos that BCH uses on their Media Platforms. However, when I look at Social Media now, I understand the marketing and analytics behind it. I also understand the process it takes to create media content and advertise it online. These are processes that can be directly applied to the Television industry.\nOne example is a project that I got to work on my own. One of the Directors had informed me that the Boston Police Department was coming to visit a patient and bring him gifts while he was recovering from his 17th surgery. Owen is 6 years old and loooooooves the Police Department. So this was going to be a big deal.\nAll I had to do was go to the Hospital and get iPhone footage of the visit and then come back to our offices in the Landmark Center and get the story ready. I edited the footage together in FinalCut and sewed together the story I wanted to tell. I also had to contact his Mom and get some information so I could write the social copy for the video.\nOnce I got the story together, the video went live. It turned out to be our most successful post of the week, receiving 140,000 views, 4,000 likes, 1,086 shares and 140 comments. The story was also picked up by all of the local news affiliates and on Littlethings.com, which filters media through a multitude of platforms such as NBC News and the Today Show. So cool right????\nThrough this I understood the importance of telling stories like Owen\u2019s. I also got to have a hands on experience of finding a story, producing the story and telling the story.\nAnother jobs of mine was to go through all of the comments on my video and respond to the many viewers. As a producer this was amazing because I got to see first hand what my viewers were responding to my content.\nBy the end of the summer, I couldn\u2019t have imagined myself in a better position. I learned so much about how video is taking over the internet and it gave me a perspective on the industry that will help guide me through my entire career. So no matter what your major is, if there\u2019s an experience that you think will help shape you as a person then go for it! Don\u2019t be afraid to branch out and try new things. If you want to work in Comedy like me, when else are you going to get to work for a Children\u2019s hospital??\nPosted on"}

Wars in Yemen and Syria are still burning hard, the feud between Qatar and the so-called Quartet of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain trundles on with no apparent end in sight, Iran continues to flex its military muscles, and both Iraq and Egypt struggle to contain terrorist attacks.\nOnce again, all but forgotten are the Palestinians.\nIsrael, buoyed by Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, continues, in flagrant disregard of international law and UN resolutions, to build settlements in the West Bank. And Trump threatens to cut off US aid because the Palestinians refused to meet his Vice President Mike Pence after the president had provocatively named Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\"They disrespected us a week ago by not allowing our great vice president to see them,\" he said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The president said he was prepared to withhold \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in aid, adding \"That money is on the table and that money's not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace\".\nThe peace proposal that Trump likes best - and that his son-in-law and special Middle East adviser Jared Kushner is reportedly pursuing together with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - looks remarkably like a real estate transaction. Unsurprising, given that the 36-year-old Kushner has no previous experience in diplomacy, but an awful lot of it in wheeling and dealing in the high-stakes world of New York property ventures.\nIt has been called \"the sanctuary plan\". It involves the Palestinians surrendering some 50 percent of the West Bank to Israel. Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank that are encircled by Israeli settlement projects would fall under the administrative control of Jordan. For their part, the Egyptians would agree to cede North Sinai to a new Palestinian entity contiguous with Gaza. The capital of this strange agglomeration would become a Palestinian town on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Abu Dis. Jerusalem whole and undivided would then become the capital of Israel.\nIt is, of course, a madness. What would cause the Palestinians to give up their rights in the West Bank in return for a piece of Egypt riddled with terrorism? Why would Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi turn over more of his land, having already been roundly attacked for giving up two small islands in the Red Sea to the Saudis?\nBut if one year of the Trump presidency has taught us anything, it is that the most extreme and ludicrous of positions can morph quickly into a crude and ugly reality.\nNow two stories are helping to nudge the sanctuary narrative along. The first was broken by the New York Times on February 3 about military support the Israelis have been providing Egypt in its fight against Ansar Beit al Maqdis (ABM), an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) on the Sinai Peninsula.

It\u2019s her first solo set since 2013\u2019s similar sounding Warp & Weft (also produced, as is this one, by husband/percussionist/multi-instrumentalist Tucker Martine) and a follow-up of sorts to her successful 2016 collaboration with k.d. lang and Neko Case. As the least well known of those three, Veirs likely acquired plenty of new fans from that project. They, as well as her established base, will find plenty to love on this glistening and often mysterious folk/pop jewel.\nVeirs explains that the album\u2019s title stems from the importance of looking out for each other in what she sees as the political and social chaos created since 2016\u2019s presidential election. Fair enough, but it\u2019s hard to believe that even after close inspection to the wistful, woozy, often existential lyrics to these dozen tracks, many listeners will come away with anything concrete in that regard. What they will experience is a beautifully crafted set of sometimes offbeat, melodically sensitive and wonderfully conceived tunes that linger in your head long after the final track, the obliquely titled \u201cZozobra,\u201d whose verse name-checks Neil Young\u2019s \u201cHeart of Gold,\u201d fades out.\nThese tunes float, drift and glide with Veirs\u2019 picked guitar lines weaving between pedal steel, synths, occasional viola and even clarinet on one tune, along with sympathetic backing vocals from Jim James and Sufjan Stevens, among others. Veirs\u2019 words are often textured with colors; \u201craised under rays of gold/ and under sapphire skies,\u201d she sings on the country-tinged \u201cSeven Falls. Elsewhere, there are mentions of \u201cyour turquoise beams,\u201d \u201c\u2026 desert domes all cold and green,\u201d \u201cher opalescent gaze,\u201d \u201cyour eyes of green and steel,\u201d and \u201csignatures stamped in silver.\u201d Her words are evocative, often haunting and poetic. She implies concepts rather than explaining them as in \u201clost is the long and loneliest town/ fairy sybil flying\u201d from \u201cMountains of the Moon.\u201d Song structures are similarly unusual, eschewing traditional verse\u2014chorus\u2014verse\u2013bridge constructs for more unusual, interesting arrangements.\nWhat could be a convoluted jumble is instead a beautifully fashioned collection of sounds that flow and shift from the ornate qualities of \u201cWhen It Grows Darkest\u201d to the stark piano and voice of \u201cThe Meadow\u201d; one that drifts with the pensive, thought provoking vibe of a foreign film or the undulating of the ocean tide. Viers\u2019 voice \u2014 similar to that of Case \u2014 is hypnotic, even trance-inducing, tying the melodic threads together, creating vistas far too alluring and challenging to snooze through, even on an album that feels like a waking dream."}

Her career breakthrough came with the popularity of her song 'Jar of Hearts'.\nChildhood: Christina Perri was raised in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, along with her brother Nick Perri, who was a guitarist in the bands Shinedown and Silvertide and with Perry Farrell.\nChristina taught herself how to play guitar, mainly by watching tapes of Shannon Hoon of Blind Melon. She attended Archbishop Ryan High School.\nMusic Career: Christina Perri moved to Los Angeles on the day that she turned 21. She married, but divorced her husband 18 months later and moved back to Philadelphia. During this period, she wrote 'Jar of Hearts', which would become a hit for her. When she returned to Los Angeles, she spent her days working as a waitress at Melrose Caf\u00e9 and spent the evenings recording music.\n'Jar of Hearts' was first featured on the US TV talent show So You Think You Can Dance in June 2010. This came about after one of Christina's friends had passed the song to the choreographer Stacey Tookey. Both Christina and her friend were in the audience watching the performance. Following its use in the show, the track sold 48,000 digital copies, debuting at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100. Within a month, it had sold over 100,000.\nPerri then recorded a video for the track, which ended up in the VH1 Top 20 music video countdown. Her live TV debut came in July on CBS' The Early Show. As a result of the attention she had attracted, as well as her online sales, Christina Perri signed a deal with Atlantic Records in July 2010, whilst Roadrunner Records continued to promote 'Jar of Hearts' on US radio.\nChristina Perri continued to make a number of high profile TV appearances, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Conan.\nIn November 2010, Perri released an EP entitled The Ocean Way Sessions, featuring the tracks 'Bang Bang Bang', 'Black & Blue', 'Daydream' and 'Tragedy', as well 'Jar of Hearts'.\nThe debut full-length album from Christina Perri, entitled lovestrong, was released in May 2011.The lead single from the album, 'Arms' was released on March 15 2011 and she performed on The Late Show with David Letterman in support of its release.\nAnother track from Perri, 'A Thousand Years' appeared on the soundtrack to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Perri is a self-confessed fan of the novel and movie trilogy. In January 2012, she announced that the song had been certified Gold, meaning it had sold 500,000 copies or more.\nShe performed 'Arms' on the November 1st results show for ABC's Dancing with the Stars. That month, she also performed 'Jar of Hearts' on Strictly Come Dancing.\nChristina Perri's image has led to her being featured in tattoo magazine, such as Inked. She has 38 tattoos in total and says that she has been getting tattooed since the age of 15. Her family were reportedly unhappy with them at first but now that she has found success in her music career, they think they are '"}

This isn't a terribly hard course for her.

If you were among those who stood behind her yesterday and watched her draw back a driver and belt a tee shot, you would know to file away that question and never ask it again.\nIs she, at 16, good enough to play on the women's tour?

The heck with that. She is so original she is probably thinking about playing - and winning - the Masters. She is so gifted she reduces even old-school golfers like Leadbetter to wild spins of the imagination.\nAsked if Wie would eventually need to settle down and grind it out on the LPGA Tour to give her game depth and consistency, Leadbetter basically said people needed to start thinking outside the box.\n\"I don't see any reason why she couldn't do that [grind it out] on the PGA [men's] Tour one day,\" he said. \"As far as she hits it already, and she's going to hit it 15 to 20 yards farther as she develops, who's to say she couldn't compete on an equal basis?\"\nSuch comments are what fuel the indignity Wie routinely faces, especially from those in the women's game who want her to pay her dues like everyone else and eventually focus on helping their sport. But while she might, in fact, need to play the women's tour regularly one day to add maturity to her game, she's not about to commit to that now, when so many other accomplishments seem possible.\n\"She's very much a pioneer, a person who seems to be comfortable breaking down barriers,\" Leadbetter said. \"It's hard to say where this is all going, because nothing like it has ever been attempted before.

From Wang Wei (the famous 8th century Chinese poet) to Matsuo Basho (Japanese Haiku master poet), from Rabindranath Tagore to Tu Fu (one of the greatest Chinese poets) and from Yehuda Amichai (famous contemporary Israeli poet) to Pulitzer Prize-winning Carl Sandburg, not even one of them has been able to remain unaffected by the allure of rain.\nDeepened colors grace thatch homes for a moment.\nHalf a mountain \u2014 and lingers on past noon.\nWho has run away from his mother to tease her.\nEarly from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.\nRain resonates within us all some really blissful emotions, in fact it has come to stand as a motif for a spectrum of sentiments. With the ecstasy of meeting and mating on one end and the agony of separation from a loved one on the other, rain and by extension monsoon, moves hand-in-glove with varied forms of human emotion and has become a loyal companion in our moments of grief and joy.\nTo trail the route of Indian literature and mythology with respect to monsoon, one can find rains playing a pivotal role. Right from Rig Veda to Ramayana readers can find due importance being accorded to the phenomenon. In the Rig Veda, hymns have been dedicated to Prajanya, a cloud, and a godlike status conformed to it.\nThere is a sense of celebration and rhapsody associated with the season. On the other hand, in Ramayana rain stands as a motif of separation as Rama has to cease his search for Sita during the rains.\nOne of the best dedications to monsoon and rains that can be found in Indian literature is Kalidasa\u2019s Meghdootam. This epic poem most beautifully captures the journey of a cloud, both literally and metaphorically (as a messenger for Yaksha\u2019s wife) and is considered to be the most celebrated poem on this theme.\nBut this sentimentality is not just reserved for poets. The soft caress of the falling drops has made many writers wax poetic about them and at times even chase them. Alexander Frater literally"}

How much sugar does each brand of cereal contain? How much salt? What is the \"nutritional quality\" of cold cereal as compared to hot cereal? Does vitamin \"fortification\" help?\nFifty-seven boxes of cereal decorate the magazine cover in the form of a labyrinth, symbolizing our national search for the Perfect Food, as if in brans and fibers we hoped to find eternal life -- or at least a flat stomach while it lasts.\nThe diet-obsessed American consumer, shopping for the ideal morning bowlful -- this is one way to look at a wheat field.\nFor a second perspective, the eye must get down to the level of the american prairie -- the nose, close enough to smell the earth -- adopting the farmer's view. What an expanse of soil still remains! There are 1,017,030,357 acres of farmland in the United States, according to the census, although that figure is said to be dropping by three million acres a year.\nSomewhere in the middle of all those acres, like a tiny figure on an enormous graph, the American farmer sits upon his harvester. The population of the United States has more than doubled since 1920. At the same time, the number of farmers has declined from 13,432,000 to 3,774,000.\nBut oh my, is the incredible shrinking farmer getting efficient! This year, according to World Business Weekly, the American farmer will account for 46 percent of the wheat traded in world markets, an increase of more than ten percent in ten years.\nWhy, then, is he a vanishing American? More statistics. During the same decade the farmer's expenses have grown 11.5 percent a year while his income rose at a rate of just 10.5.\nThe American farmer has gotten richer only in terms of real estate, if he sells the farm. Both native and foreign investors -- French, Japanese, Arabs -- wait at the edge of the wheat fields with ready cash and blueprints for shopping centers and a full crop of condominiums.\nIn corporate farming -- the agriconglomerate -- the only hope for keeping arable land arable?\nThe American farmer who can't win for winning -- here is another way to look at a wheat field.\nWashington, of course, provides a third perspective. From the Capitol steps and the windows of the White House those stalks of grain bending in the wind sometimes look like voters. Sometimes they look like whips, waiting to be lashed. The new Secretary of Agriculture, John Block, speaks for many when he refers to food as a weapon -- indeed America's most powerful diplomatic weapon. \"A bushel of wheat for a barrel of oil,\" as the saying goes.\nThe waving field of grain as America's OPEC -- this is still another way to look at a wheat field.\nThe eye in search of a fourth perspective moves even further away -- out of the country altogether. In 1930 there were two billion human beings on earth. That figure has more than doubled. According to the United Nations, at least one out of six of the human beings alive today is undernourished. Food may be a disposable temptation to the American dieter. Fodd may be a poor profit risk for the American farmer. Food may be a reward-and-punishment device for the American official faced with a recalcitrant third world.\nFor the one in six human beings"}

Is the country that got used to imposing its values on feebler client nations \u2014 bailing out southern Europeans with their oversized public sectors, rampant tax avoidance and long lunches \u2014 in trouble? The Germany described by this Frankfurt School professor is a basket case \u2014 post-growth, post-democratic, with the first fascists in the Bundestag since the Third Reich. Despite being Europe\u2019s richest country, it has higher numbers of working poor than any other EU state; almost one in four of its workers is paid less than the \u20ac9.30 minimum wage, many requiring state support.\nSociologist Ulrich Beck in the giddy 1980s called Germany an elevator society, in which millions of skilled workers upgraded from VWs to Audis and expected their children to rise still further in social status and wealth. The elevator may have seized up for a while after reunification, but only five years ago Germany seemed unstoppable. Every German, Beck thought, was in the same lift. No longer. Not only has downward mobility become more evident but the poor get poorer, the rich get richer, the older get tenure, the younger join the precariat. Sure, greater equality of opportunity means more women work than ever before, but of all German women in work only one in three earns the minimum wage. \u201cSo while German women are more equal in terms of rights, inequality between women has never been greater than it is today,\u201d Nachtwey argues.\nThis is symptomatic of what he calls regressive modernisation and of the following paradox: \u201cThe more a society is based on equality of opportunity, the more unequal it becomes, and the more legitimate its inequalities\u201d. Legitimate? The losers are perceived to be those who deserve to lose, the winners those who deserve to win. And the losers are the usual suspects \u2014 women, immigrants, those who have no qualifications. A Germany that once prided itself on social mobility, and whose sociologists once crazily imagined class distinctions were over, has become, in terms of class, as sclerotic as Britain. In any case, equality of opportunity can only ever be an aspiration, never a reality.\nNachtwey coins a new term to exemplify this situation. \u201cHomogamy\u201d isn\u2019t the German answer to Scottish New Year celebrations, but the phenomenon whereby couples wed those of similar economic status. Surgeons no longer pursue nurses as they did when the former were most likely men and the latter women; now they go for anaesthetists or other surgeons. In one sense homogamy is desirable, because it means women are less dependent on status-asymmetric marriages; in another, it\u2019s dismal because it constitutes a form of social closure where fear of the plummeting downward escalator haunts Germans\u2019 dreams and determines life partners.\nFear determines career aspirations too. Nachtwey notes that one third of all German university students are so terrified of joining the precariat that they aspire to government jobs. Better counting unemployment figures in a secure post with a decent state pension than risking redundancy at BMW. Germans with good degrees are becoming part-time kindergarten teachers.\nWhen did it all go wrong? Nachtwey goes back to August 15, 1971, when Richard Nixon buried the postwar order by taking the US off the gold standard. This was the day, Nachtwey"}

This season, they haven't lost at home and another win would clinch the AFC East after they missed last season's playoffs despite going 11-5.\n\"It doesn't matter what everybody else does,\" coach Bill Belichick said. \"If we win on Sunday, then we've achieved one of our goals this year.\"\nJacksonville needs help from others to have a shot at the playoffs after losing three of four games following a 6-4 start.\n\"They can't be must-wins and you keep losing,\" quarterback David Garrard said. \"They've got to be must-wins and you win one. That time is here and hopefully it happens this weekend, but there are no guarantees.\"\nDenver and Baltimore lead the crowded race for the two AFC wild-card spots at 8-6. Jacksonville is one of six teams at 7-7. The Jaguars missed the playoffs last year with a 5-11 record after getting eliminated the previous season when Brady threw for three touchdowns and two incompletions.\n\"Their defensive identity has changed quite a bit,\" Brady said. \"They have a new coordinator who's brought, definitely, a different style to their defense and they're much more of a blitzing defense.\"\nBrady, whose 2008 season ended with a knee injury in the opener, has played far below his level of 2007, when he threw an NFL-record 50 touchdown passes. In his last two games, he has totals of 307 yards passing with two touchdowns and two interceptions, but the Patriots won both to take a two-game lead in the AFC East with two games left.\n\"Our goals are still ahead of us and we have some great opportunities. Like all of us, I've battled some adversities,\" Brady said. \"A lot of it is being mentally tough and bouncing back from things that don't necessarily go our way and then being able to just continue to respond.\"\nThe Patriots (9-5) have bounced back from three losses in four games. But their latest wins were against two of the NFL's weaker teams, 20-10 over Carolina and 17-10 over Buffalo.\nBrady has been dealing with injuries to his ribs and a finger on his right hand. The running game, behind Laurence Maroney, has been productive, and the young defense has come through after some mediocre performances.\nThe Jaguars could be just the opponent for Brady to regain his old touch. They're last in the NFL with 14 sacks and have three rookie starters on defense, including cornerback Derek Cox. He'll have to stop Brady from completing passes to Randy Moss, who is tied for fifth in the league with 1,144 yards receiving and has 74 catches, 10 for touchdowns.\n\"It's not like I can get away from that,\" Cox said. \"I've seen these guys before on TV."}

The first percentage is for the 2015-16 school year. The second number is for the 2005-06 school year.\nIn the wake of high-profile school shootings, superintendents and school board members have been forced to wrestle with the cost-benefit analysis of how much taxpayer money to spend on transforming schools from so-called soft targets to hard ones.\nHow much is enough? And how much is too much? Safety-focused consulting firms that help school officials answer those questions are flourishing.\nEach school shooting brings a new surge of spending \u2013 with the education sector of the market for security equipment and services reaching $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, according to an IHS Markit analysis.\nSo are companies profiting from fear?\nMike Harmon, chief sales and marketing officer for Indianapolis-based Esco Communications, consults with clients across the country and spends more time talking to health care providers, senior living centers, industrial companies and higher education leaders than public school officials.\nInstead, he walks clients through the Safety and Security Guidelines for K-12 Schools drafted last year by the Partner Alliance for Safer Schools. Harmon is an alliance board member.\nThe goal is to address vulnerabilities related to procedures, drills, video surveillance and emergency notification. Other specific areas of potential weakness include the property and parking lot, the building and individual classrooms.\nThe alliance checklist breaks down four tiers of security, with the first tier being the least secure. The guidelines list what measures must be taken to meet each level of safety.\nFor example, the section on parking lot safety lists the first tier as including signs that designate student and faculty parking areas and exterior lights in strategic locations. Tier two calls for parking decals or stickers. Tier three calls for a parking lot attendant. And tier four calls for gated lots accessible only with electronic entry cards.\nHarmon readily admits the fourth level of security isn't necessary everywhere and not all of Esco's products make sense for all customers. For example, the company offers a system that will trigger an automatic school lockdown and contact first responders if the sound of a gunshot is detected.\nDottie Davis, Fort Wayne Community Schools' director of security, said the district has seen an increase in vendors offering products related to school safety and security.

Singer would set up a proctor and bribe test site coordinator, often a principal.\nThe man accused of taking or replacing student\u2019s exams is identified as Mark Riddell, a Florida resident.

Borden was struck and killed by a train after a police chase Monday in Pennsylvania.\nPolice declined to discuss a motive, citing the ongoing investigation, but they laid out Wednesday a clearer picture of the victim and the suspects.\nBennett and Trappler, who weren\u2019t married, were fighting over custody of their daughter, Lily. A custody hearing was scheduled for the day after the homicide in Steuben County Family Court.\nTrappler was previously married to Borden, who, with his stepbrother, allegedly went to Bennett\u2019s home between 10-11 p.m. Thursday. During that time, Borden allegedly shot and killed Bennett with a 12-gauge shotgun. Trappler was not at the scene at the time of the killing, police said.\nPolice did not describe how the homicide unfolded or how many times Bennett was shot. Autopsy results are due back today.\nWhile the events point toward a conspiracy, authorities declined to say what, if any, type of planning went into the alleged crime, and investigators are still looking into the suspects\u2019 and the victim\u2019s background. Additional arrests are possible, but police do not believe there are more suspects directly connected to the homicide.\nPolice investigated the homicide through the weekend, and early Monday morning, a warrant was issued for Borden\u2019s arrest.\nLater Monday morning, authorities in Pennsylvania located Borden in suburban Philadelphia. It wasn\u2019t clear why Borden, who was living with his stepbrother in Corning at the time of the homicide, was in Pennsylvania, but he used to live near Philadelphia.\nWhen police attempted to make contact with Borden, he fled in his pickup truck, then on foot. As police closed in, Borden jumped in front of a commuter train in Jenkintown. He died soon after at a hospital.\nHand was arrested in Corning just hours after his stepbrother was killed by the train. Trappler was taken into custody Tuesday in Addison, and Lily was turned over to Trappler\u2019s mother, police said.\nTrappler and Hand are currently being held without bail at the Schuyler County Jail.

On March 13, 2019, the Texas Senate announced $100 million in new funding for improving the security of our schools.\nAccording to the Texas School Safety Center, \"Time barriers or measures taken beforehand to 'harden the structure' can be an invaluable asset to safety.\" Furthermore, the Center continued by saying, \"the most powerful time barrier in an active assailant event is a locked classroom door.\"\nHistorically, most classroom doors haven't had a lock on them, which is why teachers and students have resorted to shoving furniture against the doors to prevent intruders from entering. A better and best-in-class solution is for classroom doors to be secured by RhinoWare Connect\u00ae. This unique product's simple design allows even a 4-year-old to secure the door in under one second. As soon as the door lock is engaged, an alert is immediately sent to the school's administrators about the lockdown. The alert is a critical component because it also can notify law enforcement, even before anyone on campus has the ability to report the incident. The alert also shares the exact location of the first classroom in lockdown mode.\nThe notification from RhinoWare Connect also protects students from bullies, who intend to physically harm others in a locked classroom. Since school officials are notified immediately when the door barricade is engaged, administrators can respond quickly to students needing help.\nTexas-based Premier Wireless is a nationwide distributor of RhinoWare Connect\u00ae and president Lea Bogle is passionate about bringing proven safety solutions to schools.\nFor over 25 years, Premier Wireless, a Sprint Mobility Solutions Partner, has been delivering innovative solutions that enable safety and transformation through technology for schools, governmental agencies and businesses of all types.

As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re a jack-of-all-trades. But can you count coding as one of the skills in your toolbox? Even if you\u2019re never going to be a full-time programmer, there\u2019s a lot of value in knowing how to code.\nLearning to code gives you a \u201cprogramming brain\u201d \u2013 a rational, logical approach to problem solving. As a programmer, writing lines of code is highly detail-oriented work which requires precision and tenacity as you issue commands to make the technology do what you want. You can take your \u201cprogramming brain\u201d and the skills you use when you code and apply it to other situations in your career or your business.\nThere\u2019s a wide, gaping chasm between developer teams (dev teams) and more business/operations teams. That gap leads to misunderstandings, frustration and ultimately, mistakes. As an entrepreneur, with a team of entrepreneurial-minded individuals under you, a basic understanding or programming can provide enough shared understanding to start bridging that gap. Smoother communications between your dev team and your marketing team, for example, can go a long way towards stronger sales as the marketers have a better understanding of how the product functions and what it\u2019s capable of.\nSo you\u2019ve got an idea that could be the next Facebook or Google.

We know this because we ourselves make judgments about others based on their number of connections. As it stands, you can have 20,000 connections and your profile will still say 500+. Getting to the magic 500 needs to be the goal if you want to be taken seriously.\nThere are many ways to get to 500+ and they are all surprisingly easy to implement. Even if you are a more selective networker and don\u2019t want to open up your network to people outside your industry or area of expertise, you can still rack up the connections.\nHere\u2019s how to put them into action.\nThe best way to grow your connections is to take charge of it yourself. Use these tried-and-true methods to expand your network with the right people \u2013 from the past, present and future.\nPast - Get up-to-date: Link the past with the present. Add to your existing contacts by reaching out to people from your previous companies, schools, internships, volunteer activities, and other formative experiences. Next, make LinkedIn your contact hub. Connect your email addresses and iPhone contacts through LinkedIn. This will allow you to reach out to a large number of contacts at once, no matter how long you\u2019ve known them.\nPresent - Feed it to the LIONs (the relevant ones): LIONs are LinkedIn Open networkers. This is not a designation that was bestowed on them by LinkedIn. Members decide for themselves whether they want to be a LION or not. LIONs \u2013 as their name implies \u2013 are delighted to accept connection requests from virtually any other member. To find LIONs, perform an advanced search on individual people and enter \u201cLION\u201d in the last name field. (I can hear what you are thinking right now: \u201cBut I don\u2019t want just anyone in my network; I only want relevant people.\u201d Not to worry. Read on.) To get to just those LIONs who are relevant to you and your career or business, add content to the keywords, title, company and/or location fields. Then your search will yield a list of open networkers who would be valuable to add to your network. Send connection requests to add them to your growing list.\nPresent \u2013 Build your network deliberately: To get the right people in your network \u2013 those who are decision makers or influencers and those in your community of thought leaders, begin by performing a gap analysis. Know who is in your network so you can identify missing links. You might identify these missing connections by name, job title, industry, etc. Then it\u2019s time to start building your network. In LinkedIn, you can do this by reaching out to individuals directly through a search, or connect with them through groups. When you reach out directly, send your connection requests through search instead of using the \u201cconnect\u201d button in their profile. If you connect through a person\u2019s profile, LinkedIn requires that you show how you are connected (via a company you worked for or a school you attended). That step is not required when use you use search. Search for the person you want to connect with, and then click \u201cconnect\u201d next to their name in the search results. Remember to customize all LinkedIn requests; avoid the generic one.\nFuture - Make it a habit: Every time you meet someone you would like to have in your network, reach out immediately. Or better yet, keep the LinkedIn app open on your phone and add them as soon as you meet them. Turn this into a ritual so you will always keep your network up-to-date.\nAsk people to link to you during presentations."}

Nike Training is producing a new documentary series, which launches Tuesday, to illustrate the unique ways that some of its top athletes train and what motivates them to keep challenging themselves.\nThe one key principle to keep in-mind is range. If individuals have range in their limbs, then they have stability. Without that range and stability, any high-end strength and power work will not only be more difficult to pursue, but it can be less efficient, no matter how hard one works.\nIn basic training, avoid moving too quickly to high-end strength training and focusing on individual body parts; don\u2019t train body parts, train function.\nWhen McIlroy appears in the documentary about his regimen, most of the time he is clad in Nike workout gear -- shirt, shorts and shoes -- not golfing attire. McIlroy regularly works out five to six times weeks, even during a tournament. Most average people have better chance of working out five to six times a week, even if the activity is something as simple as running around the block, than golfing, so there is also practical element to Nike's series."}

Such a task for a 14-year-old schoolgirl at an eight-nation Games would look even more difficult. But this little mermaid simply did not care about the previous records and experience of the mighty Indians and was the cynosure of all eyes at Sugathadasa Stadium pool.\nYes! That was Mayumi Raheem, the golden girl in Sri Lanka swimming, the one who made our little island nation proud at the recently concluded 10th South Asian Games. She won gold medals in women\u2019s 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke finals, all with new South Asian Games record timings. What a way to shine at the South Asian version of the Olympics!\nMany would have wondered what her expectations when the Singapore-based Lankan wonder girl flew to her motherland for the Games. But Raheem says she never focused on medals, but was merely concentrating on her timings. \u201cPrior to the Games, I was training really hard to achieve one goal; to do as many personal best times as possible. I never focused on the medals,\u201d she said.\nShe trains at the Singapore Swimming Club, under the elite coach, Jaan Murphy. But she has made many sacrifices because of her sports career. \u201cMy school and my teachers have been very supportive about the fact that I have missed school for a long period of time to compete. They have also made catching up as less stressful as possible, she said in an exclusive interview from Singapore.\nThis year\u2019s Singapore open meet made way for the little Lankan lass to show her capabilities before the SA Games. \u201cMy immediate highlight was my placings at the Singapore Open, where I set a meet record for the 200m Breast stroke. Prior to that, I went up to the semi finals in 50m breast stroke at the Commonwealth Games early this year,\u201d she added.\nBesides that Raheem has gained valuable exposure during the last couple of years. A few days after the Commonwealth Games in Australia, Raheem travelled to Shanghai for the Short Course World Championships.\n\u201cLast year, I competed in the World Championships in Montreal and the Asian Age Group in Bangkok. It was a good experience,\u201d says Raheem, whose family has been based in Singapore for the last six years. But she has often participated at meets back home. At the Sri Lanka national championships last year, she won all five events she competed and was adjudged the best female swimmer of the meet.\nHer dad is a pilot, working for Singapore Airlines and her mum is studying at a University. \u201cI have two very cool sisters the older one is Machiko who is 10 years old and is studying at UWC, the younger one is Kimiko who is 7 years and is also studying at UWC,\u201d said Raheem of her home front.\nBoth her sisters too are very talented at swimming, according to Mayumi Raheem. \u201cI hope they would bring glory to our country in future. My mum did athletics in the Southern Province and played netball for the school. My dad was an outstanding rugby player, and was also an athlete and a swimmer,\u201d she recalled her family connections to sports.\nRaheem\u2019s ultimate goal is the Olympics in sports and to make an academic career in medicine to be a doctor. Her dream swim recalled the sweet memories of Dipika Chanmugam who bagged a record seven gold medals at the 1991 South Asian Games in Colom"}

In the poverty that results, Rajghat has become a village of bachelors, with just two weddings in 20 years.\nAccording to an ambitious pledge by India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, every Indian will have electricity, and the education, health and business benefits that follow, by the end of 2018. But how Modi achieves that, and the development of what will soon become the world\u2019s most populous nation, matters to the entire world.\nOf all the most polluting nations \u2013 US, China, Russia, Japan and the EU bloc \u2013 only India\u2019s carbon emissions are rising: they rose almost 5% in 2016. No one questions India\u2019s right to develop, or the fact that its current emissions per person are tiny. But when building the new India for its 1.3 billion people, whether it relies on coal and oil or clean, green energy will be a major factor in whether global warming can be tamed.\nThis view is shared internationally: Christiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s former climate chief who delivered the landmark Paris climate change agreement says India is \u201cvery, very important\u201d for everybody, and the nation will play a key role at the UN summit that starts in Bonn, Germany next week.\nLord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist who has worked in India for 40 years, says a polluting, high-carbon development would leave India alone accounting for a huge chunk of the world\u2019s future emissions, making it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to keep the global temperature rise below the internationally agreed danger limit of 2C.\nWhat will happen remains in the balance. \u201cAnyone who claims to be able to predict India\u2019s emissions in 2030 doesn\u2019t have a lot of humility,\u201d says Navroz Dubash, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.\nIndia is embarking on one of the fastest rural-to-urban transitions in human history, with 200 million more city dwellers expected by 2030, all using new buildings, roads and cars. In this context, keeping the rise in emissions to just a doubling would be truly remarkable, says Stern, and leave India\u2019s emissions per person well below the current global average.\nBut India\u2019s vast population means that even small increases in emissions per person add up to a huge amount of carbon dioxide and India is likely to become the world\u2019s biggest polluter. \u201cThe sheer numbers of the population multiplied by anything makes it a big number \u2013 that is India\u2019s reality,\u201d says Saran.\nThere are signs of hope, however, driven by astonishing drops in the price of renewable energy in the last few years. Costs are falling faster than anyone predicted, with new record-low prices set this year for solar and wind. State governments can now pay less for clean energy than they pay for new coal power.\nThat awareness is growing fast \u2013 India\u2019s supreme court even banned Diwali festival fireworks in Delhi this year \u2013 and is putting heavy pressure on the government to act. In April, ministers announced that the sale of new petrol or diesel cars would be banned from 2030, a decade before the UK.\nCutting pollution also cuts carbon emissions, but filthy air is not the only incentive to act.

This trend is most evident when the company makes a memory or storage related breakthrough; it\u2019ll announce a new memory type or a faster, higher-capacity NAND flash storage device and it\u2019ll appear in the next Galaxy S or Note.\nIf you\u2019re the type of smartphone user that\u2019s constantly running out storage space, an announcement out of Samsung today will be of interest. The company just revealed a brand new Embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS) device with a capacity of one-terabyte (1TB) \u2013 yes, that\u2019s Terabyte, with T. That is 16x more storage capacity than a 64GB phone, which is a common capacity today.\n\u201cThe 1TB eUFS is expected to play a critical role in bringing a more notebook-like user experience to the next generation of mobile devices,\u201d said Cheol Choi, executive vice president of Memory Sales & Marketing at Samsung Electronics.\nSamsung's 1TB eUFS Chip Uses The Same Packaging As Previous-Gen Offerings.\nThe introduction of this new eUFS means next-gen smartphone will not only get a much needed boost in internal storage capacity, but a performance boost as well. Samsung is claiming its 1TB eUFS device is approximately 10x the speed of a typical microSD card. According to Samsung, sequential read speeds in the 1GB/s range are possible with the chip, with writes of about 260MB/s.\nSamsung\u2019s 1TB eUFS device employs the same package size (11.5mm x 13.0mm) as its previous-gen solutions, so any customer currently using Samsung NAND will likely continue to do so. Samsung managed to double-the capacity versus the 512GB device it introduced in 2017 by combining 16 stacked layers of the company\u2019s latest 512-gigabit (Gb) V-NAND flash memory and developing a new controller to optimize die area and performance.\nSamsung plans to ramp production of its new 1TB eUFS device over the course of the first half of 2019. That means the chip probably won\u2019t find its way in the upcoming Galaxy S10, which is due to arrive in a few weeks, but a 1TB Galaxy Note 10 is a good bet."}

The court heard from officers, Lancaster's mother and an emotional 911 call. It was revealed during the hearing that Lancaster has paranoid schizophrenia and was hearing voices in the weeks leading up to his father's death.\nLancaster has been charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing of his father, Parry Lancaster, 61, while he slept at his Brookrun Road home near Medical Center Parkway in Murfreesboro.\nElizabeth \"Libby\" Lancaster, Parry's wife and Tanner's mother, testified to the court about the aftermath of her husband's death.\nLibby Lancaster said her son had been having severe issues with his mental health in the weeks leading up to the stabbing. That day she had taken him to the doctor to receive a shot of medication to ease the voices he was hearing.\n\"He had hallucinations and heard voices for weeks,\" she said. She said the nurse who administered Tanner Lancaster's shot was \"quite worried about his mental health.\"\nLibby Lancaster detailed the \"alarming\" behavior she said her son displayed while he was suffering from side effects of schizophrenia. She said he'd take the clocks off the walls, attempted to \"baptize\" the cable box and would stand in the yard reading the Bible.\nAlthough Tanner Lancaster was hearing voices the day of his father's death, everything seemed normal between the father and son. They ate dinner, and Parry Lancaster, who was an early-to-bed, early-to-rise type, retired to his bedroom around 9:30 p.m.\nThen around 11:30 p.m., Libby Lancaster said she heard a commotion coming from their bedroom. She thought maybe her son was arguing with the voices that plagued his mind, but upon investigating, she found her son straddling her husband with a large butcher knife still inside her husband's neck.\n\"I saw (Tanner) on his knees with the butcher knife in (Parry's) neck,\" the wife said. \"(Tanner) had a look on his face that wasn't him.\"\nShe further stated she was afraid of her son after she pulled him off her husband. She testified that Tanner Lancaster was worried about his father shooting him with a gun.\nRutherford County Sheriff's Office Detective Derrick McCullough testified to the court about the scene when he responded to the Lancaster home shortly before midnight on Sept. 21. McCullough served as lead detective in the investigation.\nMcCullough said there was a \"large amount of blood\" on the bed in the master bedroom, the floors and the walls.\nHe discussed the autopsy results. Five stab wounds are noted in the report, including one that sliced through Parry Lancaster's larynx and another that punctured his liver. It rules the death as a homicide.\nSheriff's Deputy Evan Sharp, an arresting officer, also testified.\nUpon arriving at the Lancaster home, he cuffed and detained the 25-year-old suspect.

The northern half of the project from Francis Avenue to Wandermere Road on U.S. Highway 395 is scheduled to open in 2011. It will complement the two-lane section opened in 2009, and will have interchange access for the two major North Side highways \u2013 U.S. 2 and 395.\nNearly $570 million has been committed to planning, right-of-way and construction so far. That includes a $35 million federal economic stimulus grant awarded in 2010. DOT estimates it will need another $1.6 billion to finish the freeway from Francis to I-90 and could spend another 20 years on the job. By then, the total cost could swell to $3 billion.\nAs early as 1946, state officials called for building a companion roadway adjacent to Division Street to improve North Side traffic flow. The push for a freeway accelerated in the 1960s and \u201870s, but a route through the Logan and Lidgerwood neighborhoods ran into opposition and stalled.\nSelection of the current route on the east side of Hillyard occurred after BNSF Railway closed its facilities there in the 1980s, leaving behind large hunks of little-used property. Opposition to the current project has largely been limited to residents in the path of the freeway and a handful of activists.\nProponents see the freeway as means to increase efficiency of the region\u2019s roads, allowing freight and general traffic to move through the area more quickly and creating jobs and economic growth in the process.\nVern Ziegler was all smiles as he greeted old friends, mingled with long-time customers and talked about Ziggy\u2019s beginnings at the Market Street store in Hillyard.\nAn interactive timeline about the North Spokane Corridor project.\nThe Center for Justice\u2019s Spokane Riverkeeper project is alleging that the state Department of Transportation has violated the Clean Water Act during construction of the North Spokane freeway.\nA $35 million federal stimulus grant was announced this morning to extend work on a North Spokane freeway, according to the office of U.S. Sen.

What is more, it is worth mentioning the well-known word \u201cBitcoin\u201d. Besides, UX trends of 2017 included minimalism regarding layouts. No matter where you looked, you could see the pixel-perfect illustrations in combination with videos. Additionally, the last year\u2019s animations were quite well-done and functional. If we mention gradients, it is possible to say they were popular.\nWhat were the last year\u2019s trends?\nHowever, this year there are other UX best practices.\nThis kind of interface supports the idea of unification. Meaning, all the content should be put on the one page. There are not any transitions if the user clicks on it. Thanks to this, the user stays only on the main page. This is because there is no need to leave this page because all the information is present on this page.\nThis trend is quite useful. Especially, it is a good idea for such websites that are loading very slowly when the user is making transitions on the website. Consequently, this trend will help not only to save time but also leaves the user happy with the service of the website.\nOne of the top UX design trends is Gradient transitions. Today, Gradients are utilized to help connect the audience with the product by making a channel between the bold product and the potential customer. When the user is attracted by the transition of one shade or hue or another, they are being intrigued. As a result, the audience is becoming interested in the product more and more.\nHence, Gradient transitions are a very powerful UX trend of 2019. It is possible to conclude that it can be staying popular for a long time because it is very useful and effective.\nThe future of UX design is all about quality content plus visual elements. It means that all the distracting factors will be removed, and only engaging content with great imagery will remain. Consequently, it is possible to assume that the most important element of the website is content, but not a design. Meaning, the design depends on the content. So all the irrelevant element of the website in 2019 will be removed, keeping the reader focused on the content. Therefore, it is good news for those users who like minimalism, which has been a trend of 2017, to sum up.\nOne of the trends to follow in 2019 is a greater role of voice user interfaces. Nowadays voice interactions have become a common thing. For instance, they are used when you need to hear some news, get some translations, or look for some entertainment. Also, some banks already offer the possibility to use their service with a help of voice user interfaces. Besides, if you need timers, reminders, notifications about the weather, calendars, home automation, and more, you may utilize such an interface. It is becoming more and more popular nowadays and is expected to remain a UX trend even in 2020.\nFeature images are becoming an essential element of many websites. This is because their presence leaves a sense of human touch, making the content personal. Therefore, reading an article on the website, the user will think that he or she gets the information from a real human who stands behind the story.\nAll in all, such illustrations appeal to a human factor and make the user trust more to the writer of those texts, making the website seem more trustworthy.\nRelaxing colors are very useful in the UX design in 2019. They have to be soothing in order to prevent the user"}

Households paid down $50 billion worth of debt in the last quarter. Not much, but at least, they're doing what they ought to do. The feds, meanwhile, added about $500 billion worth of deficits.\nWhat Mr. Crook, and most of the elite economics professoriat, asks for is government intervention to short-circuit the process of de-leveraging. Their view of an economy is as simpleminded as Thomas L. Friedman. (More below\u2026) In their view, an economy is either growing at a healthy speed. Or it is not. If it is not, they have to do something.\nBut what can you do when an economy needs to unload debt? Well, you could help it out. You could raise interest rates and push all those millions of Humpty debtors off the wall. You could raise taxes; those suicidal householders\u2026now standing on the ledge\u2026could be encouraged to jump.\nAt least, those cures might help get de-leveraging over with faster.\nOr, you could declare a Debt Jubilee, as they did in ancient history\u2026cancelling all debts\u2026and re-starting everything at zero. Or, how about this\u2026 You could print up trillions of dollars and drop them from helicopters all over the country. That is the cure Mr. Bernanke himself, perhaps jokingly, suggested.

Among Mountain West schools, Boise State gets a lower percentage of its budget from the state than any other, Kustra said.\nThere won\u2019t be the need to take time to foster relationships with boosters as Coyle did.

Led by the agency\u2019s Tactical Technology Office, Blackjack is trying to prove the utility of commercial space mega-constellations and low-cost satellites in military systems. The plan is to take commercial buses and match them with military payloads. DARPA said its goal is to launch a small experimental constellation of up to 20 satellites to test the concept.\nDARPA already has awarded bus contracts to Airbus, Blue Canyon Technologies and Telesat. These companies will advance to the next phase, called \u201cpreliminary design review\u201d when they will integrate their bus designs with specific payloads. The first two payload awards were made to Raytheon in December and Trident Technologies in January. More awards are anticipated in March, a DARPA spokesman told SpaceNews.\nCommercial space companies regard Blackjack as a huge opportunity to break into the military market, and have urged DARPA to not allow Blackjack to turn into a typical plodding Pentagon procurement program. The issue was raised during a panel discussion at an industry conference this month, where Mandy Vaughn, president of Vox Space, had a few cautionary words fo Blackjack program manager Paul \u201cRusty\u201d Thomas.\nVaughn\u2019s comments appeared to be aimed at the upcoming phase of Blackjack, called Pit Boss, that seeks to demonstrate whether payloads on orbit can share and analyze data without any direction from the ground. During a meeting with contractors last fall, executives voiced concerns that this requirement for autonomous on-orbit data processing would make Blackjack too complex and delay its deployment. The Pit Boss solicitation was expected in October but has yet to come out, leading to speculation that DARPA is reconsidering the requirements. The spokesman did not respond to questions on when the solicitation might be released.\nThomas, reacting to Vaughn\u2019s comments, said DARPA does not intend for Blackjack to become a \u201crequirements program\u201d and that the project will continue to be the \u201cposter child for government leveraging\u201d of commercial technology."}

Both work well. Sign in via Twitter and use #eweekchat for the identifier.\nFacebook, at its annual F8 developers' conference a while back, introduced a new Messenger Platform for developers that includes bots and a Send/Receive API. Indeed, a beta program for so-called chatbots was demoed.\nBy providing these new bot components, Facebook basically opened up its popular Messenger platform to make it possible for users to message businesses and buy products or services\u2014not unlike messaging friends to arrange a night out at the movies.\nChatbots can provide anything from automated subscription content\u2014such as weather and traffic updates, to customized communications like receipts, shipping notifications and live automated messages\u2014all by interacting directly with the people who want to get them.\nChatbots will enable users to deploy Messenger to buy products and for businesses to sell items and offer customer support right on Facebook, instead of customers having to search for customer-service 800 numbers or find email support on specific Websites or apps.\nOther chatbots will allow users to interact with online services, such as messaging a Google delivery courier to buy your groceries at Target or Safeway. News articles from your trusted news outlets can be sent to you in messages; you can order takeout food and have it delivered using Messenger.\n\"We think you should message a business just the way you would message a friend,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. \"To order flowers on 1-800-Flowers, you never have to call 1-800-Flowers again.\nThese messaging applications replace Web or native apps on mobile devices. Facebook, and others sure to follow, want you to spend all your time on its site, bringing it ad dollars and enabling users to not have to bother downloading specific apps for specific buys.\nIs this a good idea for social networks like Facebook and others to control the path of least resistance (which humans fall prey to every day) and become the hub of business? Facebook certainly is looking out for Facebook--nothing wrong with that. But what does this do to the budding \"application economy\" that is feeding the IT world right now?\nWill this turn into the \"chatbot economy\" before we know it? Never underestimate the ability of people to take the simplest, easiest way to do anything, and if they can order food, flowers or a ride on their social nework, chances are they will.\n--What do you personally see as the No. 1 business advantage of using messaging as a primary way to buy and sell?\n--"}

For this project, the two brothers wanted to build a product for wall street traders, bankers. For years, the financial industry thought bitcoin was a joke and didn\u2019t want to make any effort to diversify their portfolios with bitcoin. To make it as easy as possible, the brothers filed an S-1 registration with the SEC to create this financial product that you can buy as any other ETF.

Sinead O'Connor, just recently, you posted your third open letter to Miley Cyrus. That's about three too many, but I want you to know that I understand why you write open letters and I sympathize with your motives. I'm saying that because all open letters begin with this false sense of intimacy and the bogus claim that the writer really wants the best for the person he or she is addressing.\n\"I wasn't going to write this letter, but today I've been dodging phone calls from various newspapers who wished me to remark upon your having said in Rolling Stone your 'Wrecking Ball' video was designed to be similar to the one for 'Nothing Compares' ... So this is what I need to say ... And it is said in the spirit of motherliness and with love.\"\nI'm sorry but the spirit of motherliness cannot really be enough of an answer to why you're writing. I think even you can see that attacking somebody publicly for what they're wearing isn't exactly the definition of \"motherly love.\"\nIt's not just you, Sinead. It's all open letter writers. You're writing open letters because it makes you seem like an important person. You're writing open letters because you feel that you are a historical figure whose communication should not be limited to the mundane reality of either personal one-on-one missives or online opinion publication. That's what ordinary people do. They write arguments when they disagree with somebody's opinion, and they write letters when they want to address another person. And that is what you should do, too.\nI get it. I really do. Writing an open letter connects you to the world of grand intellectuals. I mean, Emile Zola wrote \"J'accuse\" as an open letter. A great French novelist calling out his nation on their anti-Semitism. Who wouldn't want to be like Emile Zola? But here's the thing: The more times you use the open letter format, the less open letters in general matter. We have now arrived at the current position where pop singers are using a series of open letters to address soon-to-be-washed-up pop singers about their clothing selections in music videos. What I'm saying is that we've reached the low point. Subjects are not going to get any smaller or more irrelevant to the public interest. They insult the glorious history of the open letter.\nNot that there aren't still genuine opportunities for writing open letters. When Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he wrote an open letter to his employees. In Bezos's case, writing an open letter was appropriate, because he's important \u2014 he owns Amazon \u2014 and he was addressing issues that matter to the wider public \u2014 Will media survive? So good for you, Jeff. That's an appropriate use of the open letter.\nEverybody else should ask themselves the following questions before writing an open letter: Are you important? Is what you have to say of genuine political importance? Just to give you an example: If you are Nelson Mandela and you want to write an open letter on the subject of global poverty, please go right ahead. If you are a game designer, and you want to write an open letter to Speaker Boehner about the shutdown, don't.\nI just want to provide a helpful service here. Before you write an open letter, ask yourself two simple questions: Are you a historical figure? And, do you have something to say that the world absolutely needs to hear? If"}

It is a leading cause of drug-related emergency-room episodes. It is associated with psychiatric disorders, cancer and infertility, and it has a negative impact on the immune system, not to mention a host of other medical problems it causes.

The Warrington game was billed as Saints' biggest test to date - and what a way to pass it, with an utterly dominant forward display laying the platform for some dazzling tries.\nWarrington had played their part in building this game into an event - and it is what the sport needs with a 17,000 gate cramming in.\nBut after coming in big numbers and a swagger - it was the Wolves who sheepishly crept away with their tails between their legs at the end, while the home fans turned the volume up.\nThe win saw Saints leapfrog the visitors to climb back to the Super League summit after 10 rounds.\nIt is early days yet, as well we know, but there was a supreme irony in Warrington fans tweeting that the title is not won in April. Would it be rude to point out that the last time Warrington won it, it was....64 years ago.\n2. There has been a lot of talk, understandably, about the players who have shone in Saints' 1-7 this term, whether that is Lachlan Coote, Jonny Lomax and, although he did not play on Friday, Theo Fages.\nBut have we really lauded the Saints pack enough. It was not simply the huge-line denting runs of Big Alex Walmsley and the speed and direct running (and long minutes) of Luke Thompson, but front row replacements Matty Lees, Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Kyle Amor kept those standards high to make it a tough night for the Wolves middles.\nSaints' back row too provided some sharp, direct running and some punishing hits - among them was a tackle from Morgan Knowles that certainly let Blake Austin know he was in a game.\n3. That said, Coote is well worth dwelling on for his role in knitting the team together, making it tick and how that has been embraced by the fans.\nIt was always going to be a tough gig following Ben Barba - but I think we can well and truly move on from that now. His new song is even catchier than his predecessor's - so hopefully Saints can remain true to the words and stay top of the league all season.\n4. We all know forwards win matches, they lay the platform for the stars to shine. But it is those people who deliver on the back end of it who really get the people into and up out of their seats.\nTake a bow Regan Grace for an absolutely stunning 70-metre special.\nIt was not simply pace, it was the smart change of direction that wrong-footed the cover to finish off.\nWhat a try - but what an absolutely appalling late tackle from Tom Lineham after it.\nIf Grace had not put the ball down, and the Wire wing still had a chance of dislodging it then he maybe would have had a slight excuse....but it would have still been a penalty.\nFor it to occur after Grace had scored, on a player unable to defend himself, was a disgrace and should have had a card.\nThe incident was placed on report, but any ban will do Saints no good whatsoever. Punishment should take place at the time of the incident - especially after it had been reviewed.\nBut credit to Grace - he bounced up and celebrated, enjoyed the moment in front of the elated West Stand and then quietly walked away as the trainer stuffed towels up his nose to stem the bleeding.

{"idx": "20832", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Last week General Motors and Ford announced handsome rewards for their executives' 1983 performance. Roger Smith, chairman of GM, picked up $1.49 million in salary, bonus, and stock. Philip Caldwell, Ford's chairman, was awarded a total of $1.42 million.\nThe numbers sound dizzyingly high and may give ammunition to the auto workers in their coming contract renegotiations.\nExpect more such sensations as announcements about executive compensation start rolling in from other industries. ''Bonuses are expected to be exceptionally large,'' says Daniel Glasner, a senior consultant at the Hay Group , a consulting firm which also specializes in compensation management. He expects that executives in the financial companies will have made out a bit better than those in the industrial sector.\nThat's the way Mr. Gough also refers to the announcements coming out of Detroit. ''The (compensation) levels are really not out of line with historical levels'' in the auto industry, he explains. The auto companies have traditionally rewarded big in good times and cut back severely in bad.\nBreaking it down, Mr. Smith at GM was awarded $625,000 in salary, $433,000 as a bonus, and $432,490 worth of stock. (The bonus, however, is paid over a period of three years.) Mr. Caldwell was essentially awarded $520,534 in salary and $ 900,000 in bonus.\n''The initial impression is that we didn't use restraint'' in the awards, says GM spokesman William Winters. But the feeling at GM is that every bit is well deserved. ''It has been three years since the results of the company were good enough to merit bonuses for the executives - and two of those years were profitable,'' Mr. Winters explains. A total of $181.7 million was distributed among almost 6,000 high-ranking executives at GM for their performance last year.\nWinters also points out that in figuring the bonus amount, the board of directors used a 1977 formula, not the current one, making the bonus pool lower than it otherwise would have been. GM was abiding by a letter it had sent to union management, promising not to use the latest formula during the current contract. Mr. Winters adds that if you look at Mr. Smith's total compensation, adjust it for inflation, and compare it with chief-executive compensation levels of the past 42 years, it is far from the highest.\nThe problem with the GM and Ford compensation packages is not the amount, compensation consultants say, but the message they convey. ''It was not a good union or public relations move,'' says Clifford Mittman, a vice-president of Towers Perrin Forster &amp; Crosby, another consulting firm that deals with compensation issues.\nBoth auto companies face labor negotiations in September, and management would like nothing better than to keep a lid on wage increases. The bonuses, however, says Peter Laarman, a United Automobile Workers spokesman, send the message to the rank and file that the industry is healthy enough to restore labor givebacks. It also gives the false impression that Detroit doesn't really need Japanese import restrictions anymore, according to Mr. Laarman.\n''Union leadership takes the view that the industry is not fundamentally healthy at this time and that we need to make more (progress), not necessarily through wage cuts, but through productivity improvement.\nExecutive compensation will fan the flames of labor's demands this fall, but the real fuel is record"}

Two children were wounded.\nThe incident was investigated and the US military concluded that the actions of the soldiers were in accordance with the law of armed conflict and its own \"Rules of Engagement\".

He went as far as to say soldiers in his unit were ordered to kill civilians in certain circumstances.\nJosh Steiber served in the same unit as Ethan McCord. He refused to talk about the order because of, he claims, the threats and warnings he has received from his former army fellows.\nBut the secret video of helicopter killings seemed nothing unusual to him.\n\u201cFrom my experiences, what was shown in that video is not uncommon. Things like that happen on a fairy regular basis,\u201d confessed former soldier Josh Stieber.\nJosh and a group of other former soldiers are now touring the US, telling people of their experiences and their regret.\nHe also warned against short-sightedness when interpreting the leaked information.\nSome blame the type of war the US was fighting for the psychological trauma so many American soldiers are now going through.\n\u201cIt was a very disorienting and destabilizing condition of warfare for most American soldiers to try to separate the benign populace from the insurgency that wanted to kill him that were indistinguishable from regular civilians,\u201d claimed New York writer Jim Frederick.\nEthan McCord and Josh Stieber signed a letter of apology to the mother of the children hurt during the operation, and pledged to change from the inside out.\nAmerica's military chiefs are bracing themselves for more to come.

He's followed that up by tying for the team lead with five hits, including a home run and double, in the NL Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nBut he's also drawn criticism for not running out a ground ball in Game 2, and for a pair of slides to break up double plays in Game 3 \u2014 the second of which ultimately created a double play as it was judged to have been interference.\nIt's nothing new for Machado, who spent most of his time with the Orioles being their best player but having the little things called out. Orioles legend and Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Palmer criticized Machado this time, too.\nMachado\u2019s last hustle controversy with the Orioles came in June.

{"idx": "20838", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Would Autonomous Ships Be Good for Society?\nThere has been a good deal of discussion recently suggesting that unmanned, autonomous ships represent the future of the maritime industry. The discussion has been primarily driven by EU-funded research that sees autonomous, unmanned ships as a key element for a competitive and sustainable European shipping industry in the future.\nThe discussion has also been influenced by ambitious press releases from equipment manufacturers and potential service suppliers, who are expanding the concept to include a proposed automated global shipping industry. This would create a new market for vendors, but it is not driven by user demand.\nThere is little doubt that advances in information and communications technology and robotics will impact the maritime industry and accelerate changes in the way ships are operated. We have already seen the effects of automation in the manufacturing and distribution sectors and the massive changes they have brought.\nThe concepts underlying autonomous ships are based on the \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d (1) model recently developed in Germany, in which cyber-physical systems would monitor sensors, create a virtual copy of the physical world and permit decentralized decisions. Its goal is managing automated production within a \u201cSmart Factory\u201d and the integration of multiple factories, suppliers, distributors and consumers through the internet of things or services. But it is questionable whether a model developed for a controlled manufacturing environment can be transplanted to the dynamic, global, uncontrolled and open maritime environment.\nGiven both the unique nature of the maritime industry and the exponential growth in the application of technology, any attempt to predict the extent and consequences of automation is speculative at best. Any change will come in stages, and each stage will require evaluation.\nOne stage will certainly include remote monitoring of all functions aboard ships with far greater shoreside management of shipboard operations. To some extent, for certain functions, remote monitoring has been around for decades. Cost considerations and bandwidth have been limiting factors, but now that is changing. Efforts at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop and implement technology to support e-Navigation \u2013 including interoperability and harmonization of information between ship and shore \u2013 could potentially be a precursor to remotely controlled ships. That raises, at least as a concept, the possibility of truly autonomous, unmanned ships making their own decisions using artificial intelligence. While this seems like fantasy at the present time, given the increasing capabilities of technology it cannot be completely ruled out as a possibility in the decades ahead.\nThe pace and extent of how this will all evolve in international shipping will primarily be determined by economics and risk factors. It is anticipated that the cost of building a ship with the required technology and redundancies for remotely controlled operation may be higher than that of a conventional ship, even with the elimination of the crew\u2019s accommodations. The system would also require shoreside infrastructure with a global reach for monitoring and control, as well as expensive shoreside support for maintenance, repairs and functions now carried out on conventional ships by seafarers from relatively low-cost-labor-supply countries.\nCan the additional costs of an autonomous system be offset by substantial reductions in crewing costs, or their complete elimination? If not, there is no economic justification for ship owners to shift to autonomous ships.\nIt is estimated that crewing costs are only about six percent of the overall cost of running a ship. (2) Capital costs are about 42 percent and voyage costs, including bunkers, run about 40 percent. There can be no doubt that shipping is capital intensive rather than labor intensive.\nEven if all manning were to be eliminated, it is not at all clear how the relatively minor savings in crewing expenses could compensate for the additional costs of building and"}

Not just because the Giants are 4-0 and the Raiders are 1-3.\nThe Giants defense is No. 1 in yards per game allowed (232.2 average) and passing yards allowed (115). The Raiders' offense is last in yards gained (208.5) and passing yards (119.8).\nThings aren't much closer in reverse. The Giants are fifth in scoring (26.8), the Raiders 31st (10.5).\nThe Giants' offense is tied for fourth in yards per game at 401. The Raiders defense is 18th at 356.8 yards per game allowed.\nOn and on it goes. So is it any wonder why Raiders coach Tom Cable says the Giants are a team every other team seeks to emulate?\n\"You really have to respect what they've done there and what they have going,\" Cable said. \"Everybody in football would like to get those two units to be similar to their style.\"\nThe great equalizer could be whether Giants quarterback Eli Manning plays. He missed practice Wednesday and Thursday with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. He practiced Friday, which makes it more possible that he will play.\nCoach Tom Coughlin said he won't make a determination on whether Manning plays until just before game time.\nDavid Carr, the No. 1 selection in the 2002 NFL draft, has taken all of the reps and would start if Manning can't play. Manning has started 82 straight regular-season games.\nThe Giants have other injury concerns.\nWhen Michael Boley was diagnosed with a torn meniscus and had to undergo surgery Tuesday, it was a surprise to nearly everyone. But at least one guy was prepared for it.\nThat's Chase Blackburn, the backup linebacker who, it seems, can fill in at any of three positions. When Boley missed the opener while serving a suspension, it was Blackburn who stepped in.\n\"I'm ready to play any time there's an opportunity,\" Blackburn said. \"I had one Week 1 and I'm ready to go back again.\"\nBlackburn technically will replace Boley in the starting lineup, but in reality it will take several people to replace what Boley was able to do. Losing him creates a chain reaction of change throughout the defense.\nBecause Boley is such an athletic linebacker, he was able to stay on the field in sub packages and help with pass coverage. Now the Giants will likely take the linebacker off the field in those situations and replace him with safety Michael Johnson as the nickel linebacker.\n\"That was the thing about (Boley) coming in: We knew he was going to be a linebacker who could stay in when we did go sub,\" Johnson said. \"He could stay in and play coverages where normally we used to put a defensive back in.\"\nThat means safety Aaron Rouse, who joined the team two weeks ago after Kenny Phillips was put on injured reserve, will likely play more against the Raiders than he did in the past two weeks.\n\"We've got some of our defensive back guys back,\" defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan said. \"Kevin Dockery is back and Aaron Rouse is ready to play."}

But as another anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks approaches -- amid reports from U.S. intelligence sources that al-Qaeda is marshaling its reconstituted forces for a spectacular new attack on the United States -- it's time to recognize the strategic vision that has driven and shaped the terrorist movement for the past six years.\nEven more urgently, we need to drop our preoccupation with Osama bin Laden, which is once again being fueled by his latest video. But Bin Laden's days as the movement's guiding star are over. The United States' most formidable nemesis now is not the Saudi terrorist leader but his nominal deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\nPart impresario, part visionary, bin Laden made himself and the terrorist organization he co-founded into household words. Today they are paired global \"brands\" as recognizable and interchangeable as any leading corporation and its high-visibility CEO. But mounting evidence suggests that his time of active involvement in al-Qaeda operations is behind him. Forced into hiding, he has ceased to be a major force in al-Qaeda planning and decision-making and, even more astonishing, in its public relations activities.\nAccording to Asian intelligence sources, it has been two years since bin Laden reportedly chaired a meeting of al-Qaeda's Majlis al-Shura -- the movement's most senior deliberative body. The new video is his first since 2004. Two video messages in nearly three years may demonstrate his enduring symbolic appeal, but they are hardly proof of his continued command of al-Qaeda's foot soldiers.\nWhile bin Laden putters about in his premature forced retirement, making the odd cameo appearance, Zawahiri has taken control of al-Qaeda.

They&apos;re also starting to look forward to the imminent beginning of earnings season, which will represent the first chance that most get to see the positive impact of tax reform on corporate profits. Among individual stocks, Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Merck (NYSE: MRK), and Agios Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AGIO) were among the best performers on the day. Here&apos;s why they did so well.\nShares of Alcoa climbed 5% after the aluminum giant benefited from trade sanctions that the U.S. imposed on one of its Russian peers. New sanctions from the U.S. Treasury Department were aimed at Russian companies that allegedly played roles in various types of Russian aggression, including the annexation of Crimea and interference in the 2016 elections. Russian aluminum giant Rusal was hit especially hard by the sanctions, losing about half its value and helping to send the entire Russian stock market sharply lower. The resulting rise in aluminum prices will benefit Alcoa and its peers outside Russia, and shareholders apparently believe that the move will stay in place for some time.\nMerck stock gained 5% in the wake of positive trial results for the company&apos;s Keytruda cancer treatment. An interim analysis from the data monitoring committee overseeing the phase 3 study said that Keytruda achieved its primary endpoint of overall survival as a monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Keytruda has already been approved to fight cancer, but analysts believe that Merck is doing a better job than its rivals of establishing itself as the pre-eminent company with its anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover, if it can extend the range of indications for which Keytruda is approved, Merck could capture even more of its potential addressable market.\nFinally, shares of Agios Pharmaceuticals rose 10%. The news earlier today that Novartis had made an acquisition bid for AveXis caused speculation that other players in the pharma and biotech industry could make similar moves. In particular, some named Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) as potentially being in the market to buy out a smaller peer in the space, and Agios was just one of several names suggested. There&apos;s no certainty that a deal will go through or that Agios will be part of it, but with Celgene already engaged in a collaboration with Agios, it&apos;ll be interesting to see what (if anything) the biotech giant chooses to do.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It is exactly three years since I last spoke at this conference, and it\u2019s a sign of how much has changed in that time that it is not only three years, but four Culture Secretaries.\nBack then, March 2016, it was John Whittingdale who had asked me to carry out an independent review of the BBC\u2019s governance and regulatory arrangements, as part of the preparatory work for the new Charter.\nThese two main proposals, subject to a raft of detailed points, did find their way into the new Charter and Agreement, which took effect from April 2017.\nWe have worked inside this new framework for nearly two years, so it is reasonable to look back and ask how well it is doing.\nWe also have to bear in mind that the Charter calls for a mid-term review which is likely to start formally in 2022.\nThe Charter makes clear that the mission of the BBC, its five public purposes, and the licence fee model that underlies it, will not be in scope. But BBC governance and regulatory arrangements will be looked at in the light of recent experience.\nOf course, compared to my appearance here in 2016, I now wear a different hat, as Chair of the BBC.\nSo I can no longer claim the label of independence. But I hope you will find my remarks today are still set in the context of what may be judged to be the public interest.\nOne thing that almost everyone is agreed upon is that, taken as a whole, the new governance and regulatory arrangements work substantially better than the old model.\nBut arguing that the new system is an improvement is far from claiming that it cannot be improved upon.\nSo this morning I want to consider some aspects of the current arrangements, particularly those which might arise in the mid-term review.\nIt may be a couple of years away, but some of the issues are complex. And I don\u2019t need to relate how quickly time passes.\nFirst, how have the BBC\u2019s revised systems bedded in?\nIn the old model, the relationship between the BBC Executive Board and the BBC Trust was mired in a serious confusion around the responsibilities of each in the areas of governance and regulation.\nAnd the regulatory responsibility of the Trust was subject to a complicated set of arrangements with Ofcom about the extent to which the latter would involve itself in regulatory competition issues.\nI wrote towards the beginning of my review that governance and regulation needed to be thought of as separate activities. And that a regulator needed to be independent of those it regulates.\nThe old system ignored this key principle.\nThe BBC Trust was part governance Board and part regulator of the BBC. It was never clear whether its job was to champion the BBC, or stand apart and hold the BBC accountable for its licence obligations.\nToday it is safe to say that the Trust is not mourned by anyone, certainly not the Chancellor of this great University, Lord Patten, who recently described being Chairman of the BBC Trust as \u201ca terrible position to be in\u201d.\nThe revised system under the new Charter has one unitary Board, clearly accountable for the governance of the BBC.\nIt has a single regulator responsible for regulation of the BBC, as well as the other public service broadcasters.\nThe new arrangements, for the BBC and Ofcom, are easy to understand, both inside and out.

They had divided up one bag, but the other was so soaked with blood no one wanted it.\nIt was an unusual example of how American troops in Vietnam acquire their mari juana. There are simpler ways.\nIn the village of Phuocvinh next to the headquarters of the First Cavalry Division (Airmo bile), for example, a kilogram \u20142.2 pounds\u2014of marijuana Icosts the equivalent of $5. The prices vary, but marijuana is available just outside the gates of every major United States base this reporter has visited in South Vietnam.\nThe villages are supposedly off limits, but soldiers at the bases can think of numer ous legitimate reasons\u2014ranging from laundry pickups to civic action programs \u2014 to get au thorization to visit them.\nIn addition, thousands of villagers enter United States bases every day to perform a variety of tasks.

Old wo men sit at stands and little girls and boys jump on the running boards of slow\u2010moving trucks offering beads, peace symbols, Cokes, obscene photo graphs and sometimes them selves. Many of them also offer marijuana.\nA South Vietnamese reporter recently walked out of his of fice in downtown Saigon to see how far he had to go to buy marijuana. He walked less than 100 steps. He paid 300 piasters for a dozen cigarettes, which at the black\u2010market rate is about 80 cents.\nMailjuana has grown through out Southeast Asia in substan tial quantities for years \u2014 re garded as just another weed. Great heaps of it are sold open ly and cheaply in the central markets of Vientiane and Pnompenh.\nBut until the American sol dier arrived in South Vietnam there was very little market for it. Asian women frequently prefer the mildly narcotic effect of chewing betel nut\u2014the nut like seed of the betel palm\u2014 and men in Asia are more often attracted to the gooey pleas ures of the opium pipe.\nIn the last several years, however, the South Vietnamese have demonstrated their will ingness to meet demand with supply, and have made mari juana a cash crop. In addition, great quantities of marijuana are bought and sold at country side black markets along the Cambodian border, primarily in Chaudoc Province in the west ern Mekong Delta.\nFarmers in Chaudoc Province, sensing the market potential, have begun devoting portions of their riceland to marijuana.

Blanco was widely criticized for the state&apos;s response to Hurricane Katrina and she announced months ago that she would not seek re-election.\n\"I think the Jindal camp, almost explicitly, (wanted) to cast it this way: If you were able to revote, who would you vote for?\" said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political scientist.\nJindal has held a strong lead in the polls since the field of candidates became settled nearly two months ago.\nBut the two multimillionaires in the race \u2014 Boasso, a state senator from St. Bernard Parish, and Georges, a New Orleans-area businessman \u2014 poured millions of their own dollars into their campaigns to try to prevent Jindal&apos;s victory.\nCampbell, a public service commissioner from Bossier Parish, had less money but ran on a singular plan: scrapping the state income tax on businesses and individuals and levying a new tax on oil and gas processed"}

My wife is from there; her family still lives there.\nWhen we return to visit, we have to reckon with a frightening reality: My in-laws\u2019 newly elected congressional representative is deeply implicated in anti-Semitism.\nWe are not dealing with minor missteps that can be overlooked. We\u2019re dealing, after all, with a person who, when asked what motivated Sen. Joe Lieberman\u2019s vote for the Iraq war, boiled it down to a simple question: \u201cJew or Arab?\u201d We\u2019re dealing with a person who ran campaign ads stating that the opponent was \u201cowned\u201d by wealthy Jewish financial backers. When the representative was elected last November, we could no longer avoid confronting anti-Semitism from the elected officials in Congress tasked with representing our family.\nI\u2019m referring, of course, to Rep. Jim Hagedorn \u2013 a Republican representing Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\nLike any elected official, Omar absolutely deserves to be held accountable for her statements. We must call out politicians on both the left and the right who twist ancient anti-Semitic tropes to win votes and vilify our own.\nBut it\u2019s important to notice the fundamental hypocrisy in allowing those who have a terrible track record on anti-Semitism or any other form of bigotry to co-opt the conversation. We can\u2019t allow the loudest voices on both sides of the political spectrum shout over the vast majority of Jews.\nFor Jews who are Democrats (which is to say, the vast majority of Jewish Americans), it\u2019s been hard to keep track of where Omar stands on Israel and anti-Semitism.\nIn August, she went to a synagogue and expressed her opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement \u2013 only to flip-flop after the election and endorse BDS. Then, rather than acknowledging the switch, she insulted everyone\u2019s intelligence by insisting that saying the BDS movement is \u201cnot helpful in getting that two-state solution \u2026 I think that pressure really is counteractive\u201d did not actually preclude her from endorsing BDS.\nAn old tweet accusing Israel of \u201chypnotizing\u201d the world was dug up, and for a while Omar dug in. But then she apologized with one of the single best responses to anti-Semitism allegations that I\u2019ve ever seen from a non-Jewish politician. And yet, too soon after that, she was \u201cchuckling\u201d at how we can call Israel a democracy when we attack Iran for being a theocracy.\nAnd then came the \u201cBenjamins\u201d comment. She asserted that McCarthy, who has threatened to take action against her and Rep. Rashida Tlaib because of their positions on Israel, was only making a fuss because \u201cAIPAC!\u201d is paying him to do so.\nBut that is only half the story. Even those of us who have been sharply critical of Ilhan Omar also see that many of her critics are not exactly equal opportunity in their attentions. Few politicians implicated in anti-Semitism receive the torrent of scrutiny and the ceaseless pile-ons that Omar endures from the right.\nExamples of mainstream right-wing anti-Semitism abound.

The lighter load should make MCI more nimble and able to take bigger gambles, which is what scares competitors.\nThe history detailed in the report is fascinating reading, and the corporate governance ideas Breeden puts forth will result in MCI emerging from bankruptcy with some of the strictest, most-progressive management thinking anywhere.\nBut the market MCI emerges into is still troubled, best characterized by AT&T\u2019s on-again off-again wedding dance with BellSouth. As nicely positioned as AT&T is with its modern network and reputation with big business, its efforts to find a regional Bell operating company partner is indication enough that colossal change is still to come.\nIt is not unreasonable to expect AT&T and MCI to be swallowed by RBOCs and the market to settle out with three or four national, all-purpose players.

The source material is so rich and multi-layered and requires so many good actors to pull off properly, and neither of the directors involved are particularly distinguished. But it turns out that Paul W.S. Anderson, the director I would have least expected to nail this assignment, has ended up with the perfect Rochefort: Mads Mikkelsen.\nIt's actually a relatively decent cast across the board, though casting Milla Jovovich as Milady strikes me as an error of understanding of the character: she's supposed to look angelic and sweet at first, only revealing her darker side later in the story. But Mikkelsen is really a standout choice for Rochefort, a hard character to nail since he begins the series as D'Artagnan's enemy, and ends as his friend, and victim.\nI've been slightly obsessed with Mikkelsen since he redefined Bond villains for the modern age as Le Chiffre in Casino Royale. He's capable of simultaneous lethality and intense emotional control, but unlike other action heroes, he doesn't come across as a blank. There are always a lot of things going on behind the facade his characters maintain. I think Rochefort will benefit from his experience in that kind of balance, and it'll be good for Mikkelsen's American career for audiences to see him as someone with style, and a bit of humor.\nOf course, I can't divine what the script will be like from casting decisions. It might be an awful adaptation. But I think it shows a certain intelligent sense of the material to cast Mikkelsen, and I also like the decision to cast Orlando Bloom as the well-intentioned, but ultimately weak, Duke of Buckingham. Bloom pulled off his performance as Legolas in the Lord of the Rings movies because the character is intentionally delicate-but-badass, but in Pirates of the Caribbean, it always made sense to me that Elizabeth became the Pirate Queen rather than Will, and that Will made a sacrifice for love. Bloom's more of a lover than a fighter. And Mikkelsen will give the quite young Logan Lerman, who will be outgrowing his Justin Bieberish hair as D'Artagnan, more than a match for his steel."}

Check out the very current Department of Energy country analysis on Sudan! Updated in July 2004, how about that!\nRule 2: Leverage of oil is important, and who leverages it wins the prize! Because you have already reviewed the Department of Energy analysis of Sudan, you know which government has been closely working with the [evil] government of Sudan for years protecting and investing in their oil industry. You also know which government has had Sudan under sanctions for some time as a \u201cterrist\u201d country. To make it easier, let\u2019s call the two other governments, uh, I don\u2019t know\u2026. China and the United States? And, oh my goodness, just last year the darned French agreed to build a huge power project in Sudan. If this scenario is beginning to sound vaguely familiar, welcome to modern American foreign policy 101!\nRule 3: Illusions of financial security are sacrosanct. No problem with including Sudanese genocide as part of the \u201cproblem\u201d in the Middle East, and no problem funding the war machine. Troops are signing up in droves, and the economy has been recovering strongly for years now. Check out the good news!\nRule 4: Remember the Federal Reserve System and keep it holy. Sudan may not count for much other than oil. But if you think about China\u2019s economic and financial interests along with the imperative of Rules 2 and 3, it gets a bit dicey. Re-read Gary North\u2019s assessment of a few weeks ago for more insight.\nRule 5: Propaganda works, and government propaganda works even better. The founders had reason to beware entangling foreign alliances, because so many influential Americans already had them. People in America, especially the voting class, had first-hand knowledge of and maintained strong cultural, business, and familial links to European countries. The concern was that people with first-hand knowledge, experience and strong interests overseas would push Washington in unwise foreign policy directions. 230 years later, the situation has metastasized. In our unwatched Washington Petri dish, American foreign policies are creatively designed and presented by those with specific but often very private and often downright un-American ideological and economic interests. The corporatists have settled inside the beltway, and like busy little termites are devouring the house. In the process, they are excreting massive amounts of foreign policies like pre-emptive invasion and global law as long as we make it and are conveniently the only ones not bound by it.\nWithout a popular opposition to Washington\u2019s corporatist agenda, we receive American foreign policy as a kind of national male performance enhancer.

{"idx": "20887", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Of the thirty contingencies included in this year\u2019s Preventive Priorities Survey, renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula following a collapse of the denuclearization negotiations was assessed as a top tier priority for the United States in 2019. The contingency was deemed moderately likely to occur and, if it does, will have a high impact on U.S. interests.\nHistorically, U.S.\u2013North Korea denuclearization negotiations have proceeded haltingly. Efforts to dismantle North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program have spanned several diplomatic initiatives, including the Six Party Talks between the United States, China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, and South Korea, which started in 2003 and resulted in several attempts at establishing disarmament principles. In 2017, initial interactions between President Donald J. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not look promising for continued diplomatic engagement, as Trump and Kim exchanged bellicose remarks and tweets.\nHowever, in 2018, both Trump and Kim indicated an interest in re-starting negotiation efforts. Following two successful meetings (one in April and one in May) between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim at Panmunjom, Trump met with Kim in Singapore in June to discuss denuclearization on the peninsula\u2014the first time a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader have met in-person (previous diplomatic initiatives have largely involved cabinet-level envoys). Kim has also traveled to China and South Korea for talks. Another high-level summit between Trump and Kim may occur in 2019, with negotiations currently underway to confirm a meeting location.\nHowever, recent speeches by Kim, Moon, and Trump indicate a possible misunderstanding of what denuclearization of the peninsula will mean for each of the parties. Kim continues to assert that denuclearization will include the entire Korean peninsula and that the United States should ease sanctions to indicate a commitment to negotiations. For Moon, denuclearization talks have provided an opportunity to discuss the improvement of economic ties between North Korea and South Korea, and an end to the armistice that has largely governed Korean relations since 1953. The United States, meanwhile, has requested that North Korea cease its nuclear weapons tests and dismantle its nuclear program.\nThough U.S.\u2013North Korea relations have changed markedly from last year\u2019s survey to this year\u2019s, as the Trump administration re-engages North Korea in denuclearization talks, further opportunities for misunderstanding are rife. A collapse of the current talks would have a significant impact on U.S. interests, as well as that of allies like Japan and South Korea. At the low end of the risk spectrum, an end to talks could result in more nuclear tests by Kim\u2014with concomitant instability on the Korean peninsula\u2014and cyberattacks; at the high end, a military confrontation between North Korea and the United States or a U.S. treaty ally remains within the realm of possibility.\nThe Preventive Priorities Survey was conducted in November 2018, and reflects the expert opinion of respondents at that time. As such, it should be viewed as a snapshot assessment. Recognizing this, CPA tracks ongoing conflicts, including the North Korea crisis, with our Global Conflict Tracker.

They were asked only to review the 22 safety recommendations contained in the report on a technical basis, and they performed that task, she said.\nThe department has said previously that by listing the experts who had peer-reviewed those recommendations, it did not mean to imply that those experts also agreed with the moratorium.\nThose assurances have done little to mollify a group of Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee, who urged Kendall in a letter this week to launch the investigation.\n\"Were any laws broken?\" asked the seven lawmakers, led by the committee's top Republican, Doc Hastings of Washington. They also questioned whether the White House or political appointees had any influence.\nDepending on the results of the investigation, the inspector general could come up with recommendations aimed at preventing a repeat of any problems she finds.\nSeparately, a bipartisan group of senators urged Salazar to resume and expedite shallow-water drilling permits. Although those operations are not covered by the moratorium, the senators noted that only one new shallow-water permit has been issued in the last 10 weeks.\n\"Idling the Gulf's shallow-water rig fleet indefinitely would be another blow to a region that has already suffered enough during this unprecedented disaster,\" said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.\nShe and the nine other senators \u2014 eight Republicans led by Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and one other Democrat, Mark Begich of Alaska \u2014 introduced a resolution urging a swift review of applications. They also pressed the case in a letter to Salazar.\nMelissa Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said it has been working with shallow-water drillers to provide guidance on the requirements of new reforms, which were put in place to strengthen offshore drilling safety and protect the environment.\nIn addition to issuing written guidance, the bureau has concluded a week of discussions led by Director Michael Bromwich and will continue to have a dialogue on the matter, she said."}

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, all of that was an elaborate cover for drug trafficking.\nOr so you would have to surmise from the affidavit supporting the search warrant that the DEA served on Tennant\u2019s offices and home last week, which describes \u201cinvalid prescriptions,\u201d \u201cred flags of diversion and fraud\u201d and \u201ccombinations of drugs that are consistent with \u2018pill mill\u2019 prescribing practices.\u201d The allegations and insinuations show how the DEA has tried to criminalize differences of opinion about pain treatment, encouraging doctors to think about their legal exposure first and their patients second.\nTennant says the \u201cred flags\u201d perceived by the DEA are consistent with a practice like his, which specializes in treating severe, intractable pain caused by conditions such as arachnoiditis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and post-viral neuropathy. \u201cWe only take people who have failed the standard treatments,\u201d he says.\nTennant\u2019s willingness to take hard cases explains why some of his patients live in other states, a fact the DEA considers suspicious. \u201cWe only see them in conjunction with their local doctors,\u201d he says.\nIn addition to severe pain, Tennant\u2019s patients often have metabolic abnormalities that make them less sensitive to opioids and have developed tolerance after years of pain treatment. Those factors explain the doses that struck the DEA as suspiciously high and the drug combinations it deemed reckless.\nIn nine out of 10 cases, Tennant says, he has been able to reduce patients\u2019 opioid doses substantially, by as much as 80 percent. At the same time, he defends the use of high doses for patients who need them, a stance that bothers the DEA.\nThe search warrant affidavit cites a 2009 article in which Tennant and two other doctors defended the prescription of \u201cultra-high opioid doses\u201d for certain patients with severe chronic pain. The affidavit also notes that Tennant championed the California Pain Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, a 1997 law affirming that \u201copiates can be an accepted treatment\u201d for \u201csevere intractable pain.\u201d The DEA seems to be arguing that Tennant\u2019s sincere medical opinions and advocacy on behalf of pain patients should be considered evidence of criminal activity.\nThe DEA suggests that speaking fees Tennant received from Insys, which makes the oral fentanyl spray Subsys, amounted to kickbacks. The DEA also implies that it\u2019s improper to prescribe Subsys for anything other than cancer pain, the application for which it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nTennant notes that it\u2019s common practice for doctors who have experience with a drug to get paid for training colleagues to use it. He says Subsys \u201cturned out to be somewhat disappointing,\u201d but he prescribes it for half a dozen patients who find it useful for breakthrough pain, including a few who do not have cancer \u2014 \u201coff-label\u201d uses that are perfectly legal.\nTennant, who has testified against \u201cpill mills,\u201d says his clinic looks quite different: It has a six-hour intake process, sees a maximum of"}
{"idx": "20891", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: This weekend the Texas Legislature approved HB 2741, a vehicle licensing bill that included a provision to increase penalties on trucks that are hauling overweight loads on our roadways. The House voted 135-9 to approve this measure after differences between House and Senate versions of the bill were ironed out in a conference committee. The Senate approved the measure as well, but the recorded vote is not available as of this publication. All that is missing now for our roadways to become a little bit safer is for Governor Rick Perry to apply his signature.\nCurrently the law on overloading trucks is hardly even a slight deterrent to those who wish to cheat the system to gain an unfair business advantage by carrying overweight loads. The average fine for violation of existing law is less than what you and I would pay for a speeding ticket - about $150. Under the new law, there is a sliding scale of penalties that range up to $10,000 for the first offense. These fines are doubled on the 3rd offense. The bill also includes fines for trucking companies with repeat offenses, and in some cases, for shippers who are demanding heavy loads be carried.\nOverloaded trucks are destroying roadways in Texas at a record rate. Roads that are designed to last twenty to thirty years are being turned to rubble in five to ten years. In addition to the huge maintenance expense, these damaged roads are a massive safety hazard causing damage to other vehicles, accidents and even fatalities. Often accidents are also caused by drivers not being able to control the overloaded trucks in an emergency situation leading to increased highway deaths. This is why it is so important for Gov. Perry to sign this bill into law.\nIt has been an interesting process, watching this series of bills make their way into its final form and passage. I am reminded of what someone once said about the making of sausage. You can enjoy eating it, but you do not want to watch how they make it.\nIn a bill like this, there are many competing interests who are looking out for their own well-being. County governments want money for road repairs as does TXDOT. At the same time, the many areas of the trucking industry want to protect their ability to do the vital job of hauling our nation's goods to market. Taxpayers want their investment in our roadways to be protected and drivers want safe roadways so they and their families can drive safely. Many of these interests are mutually exclusive and negotiations can be difficult.\nOf course, the trucking industry is not monolithic in its wants and needs either. There are oil company truck companies, logging trucks, garbage haulers, milk and other ag related trucks, ready mix trucks and dump trucks. Trying to keep all of these competing interests happy is a very difficult task for legislators in drafting a final solution like the one passed.\nIt brings to mind, the game of Whack-A-Mole. As soon as you get ready mix companies happy, up pops the oil industry. Satisfy them and up pops logging companies. Make them happy and county governments pop up looking for their money. Then taxpayers start yelling for enforcement and safety on the roadways. As each mole pops up, they must be dealt with and brought on board. In some cases the bill was made stronger. In others it was diluted.\nIt took a great team of legislators working long hours to bring this bill to passage. Initial legislative drafts were introduced by Representativies Allen Fletcher (R-Cypress), George Lavender (R-Texarkana), James White (R-Woodville) and Senator Robert Nichols (R-Jacksonville)."}

Yes,'' Signorino Jr. said.\nThe rivalry waned through the years and became perhaps the fourth most noted rivalry on Toms River South's schedule because of intense rivalries Toms River South developed with Toms River North, Toms River East and Brick."}

But\u2026 how much truth is there to that? Was the recent gale, with its 100+kph winds, really a symptom of climate change in action?\nThat indeed is the consensus of the scientific community. But as we all know, climate change scepticism remains rife\u2026 and there are also enormous vested interests in resisting measures to reduce emissions, etc. In a nutshell, our entire economic model \u2013 basically, consumerism \u2013 seems to be geared up to perpetuate the problem. Yet when it comes to proposing solutions, the suggestions always seem to translate into a burden to be borne by the individual consumer: i.e, the end-person buying the product or using the service\u2026 not the system itself. Is that an accurate assessment, first of all?\nBut if the world\u2019s global mega-corporations are (or feel) unaffected by the threat\u2026 if the oil industry continues to generate billions in profit, and pays lobbyists to counter scientific advice on climate change with propaganda\u2026 what impetus do they have to change their own work practices?\nAnd yet, \u2018capitalism\u2019 also hinges on the principle of \u2018demand and supply\u2019.

A few years ago, it was almost unheard of for Maltese people to \u2019want\u2019 an electric car. Today, importers are bringing them in by the cargo-load. Isn\u2019t this an example of capitalism bringing about change?\n\u2026 and therefore, out of mind. I see what you\u2019re saying, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t leave us citizens with many options. If individuals are powerless to have an affect through their own choices, and the economic model has no intention of reforming itself\u2026 it suggests that change can only be achieved through a thorough, radical shake-up of the entire system. How realistic is that? And is it really a case of drastic measures for drastic times?\nWe must be realistic about how drastic the problem really is. Unfortunately, we are now bracing ourselves for the next stage: a total collapse of eco-systems. This is now already being mentioned in the mainstream media as well. Since the 1970s, around 60% of all mammals, birds, reptiles and fish have been completely wiped out. Not in terms of species going extinct; but in terms of populations\u2026 More recent studies are now showing that the same or even worse is happening with insects.\nNot a very high score\u2026 out of curiosity, how did other countries do?\nThis raises the question of what Malta is doing \u2013 or even what Malta can do, given its size \u2013 to counter climate change. As I recall, we still have Kyoto Protocol targets to reach by 2020 \u2013 next year \u2013 and it Is an open secret that we are not going to meet them, or even come close. Is it simply too late to do anything now? And if not: what can tiny Malta do, anyway?\nI hate to say it, but the picture you paint is still rather bleak.

The words of a familiar hymn appear on the computer monitors adjacent to Weatherby's microphone stand.\n\"Well, I guess if you're going to worship,\" he says, \"you need to open your cakeholes again.\"\nWeatherby is the preacher for The Refuse, a self-described \"nontraditional\" church that meets Saturday evenings in the rose-colored basement of the Harvest Downtown Church. Formed in September 2004, The Refuse provides a 90-minute Christian prayer service \"for the left out and the right-brained,\" in Weatherby's words.\nThe congregation is made up of Christians who say they are fed up with the megachurches of their youth. The Refuse is a small antidote to the politics and the \"hollowness,\" as one member says, that pervade so many of Colorado Springs' houses of worship. Pastor John Hopkins' sermons which often draw Goths, punks and the homeless remain, simply, about the love of Christ. The evening includes a potluck dinner, after which Weatherby passes a KFC container around the crowd for donations. An indie rock record plays in the background.\nWeatherby modeled The Refuse on Denver's Scum of the Earth Church, a similar, 150-member congregation that seeks to facilitate worship in a nonjudgmental atmosphere.

The Westwood campus surpassed its fundraising goal last year, 18 months ahead of schedule.\n\u201cProbably the most common source of difficulty with underground construction, is from liquefaction,\u201d says Jonathan Stewart, UCLA professor of geotechnical engineering.

{"idx": "20902", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The incline bench press is a strength-training move to build your chest and fronts of the shoulders. The move is performed in a face-up position on a workout bench set at an angle. You then grasp dumbbells or a barbell in an overhand position, and extend and bend your elbows to elevate the weight over your chest. Incline chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the move. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body.\nThe pectoral muscles lie against the front of the rib cage and consist of the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor. The pectoralis major attaches near the shoulder joint and at the breastbone. The pectoralis minor lies underneath the pectoralis major, and originates at the middle ribs. The muscles help your arms move across your chest and move your shoulders forward, such as in a shrug. A study in the July 2010 issue of the \u201cJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\u201d found that an incline chest press performed with the bench at a 44 or 56 degree angle activated the clavicular \u2013 or upper \u2013 portion of the pectoralis major muscle significantly more than a flat bench press. A flat bench press is more effective at activating the lower portion of the pectorals, the sternocostal region, than an incline press, however.\nWhen you exercise with free weights \u2013 dumbbells or barbells \u2013 you activate more than just the primary muscles you seek to target. Other muscles work to stabilize during the exercise, which makes working out with free weights a great way to train the whole body. During the incline press, the rhomboids at the upper back, the rotator cuff at the shoulder, the posterior deltoids at the back of the shoulders, the triceps at the back of the arm, the extensors at the forearm and the serratus anterior at the upper ribs all act as synergists, or assistors, to help you execute the move. If you use an incline chest press machine with cables or a fixed rod, these synergist muscles are less likely to be activated.\nThe 1995 study in the \u201cJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\u201d concluded that a closer hand grip on an incline or flat bench press creates more activation in the upper head of the pectoralis major. The incline press also puts less emphasis on the longest of the triceps muscles than a decline or flat bench press. Because the flat, decline and incline bench presses offer different emphases on the muscles of the chest, shoulders and triceps, include them all to create a well-rounded chest workout."}

The next year or so will be different, with the Champions Trophy to be followed by a series of tough overseas tours that promises to test Kohli and his team\u2019s mettle.\nBut at least in one aspect of his career, he has already left all other sportsmen in India behind\u2014his brand value. In October, a report on India\u2019s most valuable celebrity brands published by Duff & Phelps, a New York-based corporate finance advisory firm, put Kohli\u2019s brand value at $92 million, second only to Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s $131 million.\nYou were the second most valuable celebrity in India before you signed a Rs110 crore deal with Puma in February.

It\u2019s not something I strive for or work towards, it\u2019s just a by-product of whatever I\u2019m doing in my professional career, so the focus always remains on that. But yes, these things are an important facet of your life and I have a strong management team that\u2019s really doing a good job with me on that.\nEven Sachin Tendulkar at his peak or M.S. Dhoni at his peak did not command the reach and value that you do now. What has changed in the way sportsmen in India are marketed?\nI can\u2019t really pinpoint that to anything but you have to understand where the commercial market is going. In general, the money has increased in the sport, the money has increased with brands, so it\u2019s always going to be a progress. The guy coming in after this group of cricketers is done, they may make more money with brands. And the game is progressing as well, going a little bit more global, and all these factors play a massive role in your brand valuation going up. But it also has to be a natural thing for people to find that connect with you. I haven\u2019t made a conscious effort towards that, I\u2019ve just been myself, but maybe people have started connecting to me in a way, and that\u2019s one of the reasons. When you are playing on the field your emotions are raw, and if people connect to you, they do; if they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t. It\u2019s as simple as that.\nHow do you manage your time? Do you participate in the process when you are making a deal?\nI\u2019m part of everything actively. Nothing is blindly signed, it\u2019s always discussed, and my management also does not bring things to the table that do not connect to me. The owner of the company (Cornerstone), Bunty (Sajdeh), I\u2019m very close to him and he understands my personality, my character, so they won\u2019t bring something to me that does not resonate with me in any case. But even then, it\u2019s subject to whether I like it or not. A particular brand may be very big but the campaigns they are willing to do, or the creative freedom may not be in our hands, and if that doesn\u2019t resonate with what I believe in, I can still reject"}

For the digital media darling known for edge and hipness, how else could it have gone?

On the contrary, this was the year the internet finally realized it doesn\u2019t have to pretend to be TV anymore.\nPart of the reason the new kids of digital media didn\u2019t stray much from that formula lies in the reason the NewFronts were born. The whole idea started at Digitas, now DigitasLBI, a unit of ad giant Publicis and was created as a showcase to introduce the agency's biggest advertisers to the burgeoning world of digital video. The idea quickly took off and soon YouTube, Yahoo, Hulu and others were throwing their own \"NewFronts\" alongside that very muched aped the format of the famous TV \"upfront\" presentations, where billions of TV ad dollars come up for grabs each spring.\n\u201cI think initially they wanted the same kind of attention as the networks,\u201d says James Zayti, group director of Hyundai Media for the ad agency Innocean. That meant going for the same type of razzle-dazzle buyers were used to.\nIn the TV industry, the upfronts are a tradition for two reasons: since TV ratings are finite, advertisers have long sought to reserve time in advance, and since traditionally broadcast TV rolled out its new schedules in the fall, spring was the right time for advertisers to get a sneak peek and lay down their chips.\nBut in the digital world, the number of eyeballs is, theoretically, near-limitless, and there\u2019s no set airing schedule, so there\u2019s no need to make big deals all at once with major buyers as there is in television. That said, the digital version of the upfronts found their own reason to exist: the world of digital video is so vast advertisers feel they need a these Newfronts just to keep up. Indeed, the digital bonanza, which is now run by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, continues to grow, packing a rather fatiguing 37 digital shops into just 10 days.\nThere was a sense this year among the bigger players, though, that they could perhaps stand out from the growing crowd by deviating from the typical formula. Even some of the smaller ones, like first-timer Great Big Story, CNN\u2019s new digital video shop, decided not to hew to tradition.\nSo Great Big Story had everyone roam around free-range, eating, drinking and looking at videos on the GBS app on iPads and monitors strewn around the room.

Super Formula Japan, previously known as Formula Nippon, has been running since 1973 with its driver roster including Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine, Pedro De La Rosa and Ralf Schumacher.\nThe series has switched to a new Dallara SF14 chassis this year, which is based on the Italian manufacturer's GP2 chassis. The erstwhile V8s will be replaced by two-litre, 550 bhp turbocharged engines from the stables of Honda and Toyota - drawing parallels with Formula 1 which has switched from naturally-aspirated V8s to 1.6-litre turbos this year.\nThe official tyre supplier is Bridgestone and the lap time of the new car is just 3-4 seconds slower compared to the 2013-spec F1 cars. \"With the new 2014 F1 cars being over five seconds slower compared to last year, I think Super Formula may end up being the fastest series in the world.\n\"Of course F1 teams will improve massively during the course of the season but it is amazing that a spec-series can be so close to the pinnacle.\" The car will also be equipped with a 50 bhp 'push-to-pass' system, along with Drag Reduction System (DRS) to improve overtaking, as applied in F1.\nThe new-look Super Formula has attracted an exceptionally strong grid of drivers for the 2014 season, including former F1 pilots Vitantonio Liuzzi, Takuma Sato and Kazuki Nakajima alongside Karthikeyan.\nLe Mans 24 Hours winners and WEC World Champions Andre Lotterer and Loic Duval will also line up on the grid, along with former Force India F1 test driver James Rossiter.

{"idx": "20914", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: US high court should hear Rubashkin case to consider overzealous DOJ and judge who was essentially on prosecution team.\nLawyers for Sholom Rubashkin \u2013 Paul Clement and Nathan Lewin \u2013 two months ago filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court. Rubashkin is seeking relief from the Supreme Court because the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit refused to consider evidence that Rubashkin first discovered after the trial that made the trial fundamentally unfair.\nIndeed, during the past few years, a series of federal judges have criticized the US Department of Justice for prosecutorial misconduct. Judge Emmet Sullivan of D.C. District Court, who ordered a criminal investigation into the actions of prosecutors in the trial of former Alaska senator Ted Stevens, suggested that the case reflected deeper problems at the Justice Department. Chief Judge Mark Wolf of the District of Massachusetts found that he regularly presided over cases where federal prosecutors withheld important evidence, about every other year for the past two decades.\nIt\u2019s happened again, but this time the judge herself is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. When Agriprocessors, an Iowa kosher processing plant, learned that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) was concerned about its hiring practices and planned a raid, it hired a law firm to contact ICE and offered to cooperate with the authorities in terminating undocumented workers. ICE did not reply. Instead, on May 12, 2008, it launched a highly publicized raid, with about 600 agents in riot gear, accompanied by a Blackhawk helicopter. Agents arrested 389 workers.\nFive months later, the government arrested the plant\u2019s manager, Sholom Rubashkin, on charges of harboring illegal immigrants, but ICE\u2019s case had problems. For example, it turned out that an undercover ICE agent had twice tried to secure employment at this plant, but he was turned away because he did not have the proper papers.\nIt would not do to have such a dramatic raid and nothing to show for it. The Justice Department filed seven superseding indictments charging bank fraud. The indictments included a creative theory \u2013 that Rubashkin falsely certified to the bank that Agriprocessors was complying with all the laws even though it was employing undocumented aliens. The federal jury did convict on the bank fraud charges, and the federal government dropped all immigration charges. In the meantime, Iowa indicted Rubashkin for employing child labor. The state initially alleged 9,311 offenses and went to trial on only 83; the trial judge limited that number to 67, and the jury acquitted on everything.\nFederal prosecutors recommended life imprisonment. After widespread criticism of such a harsh sentence by many people (including six former US attorneys general), the government asked for a 25-year sentence. Judge Linda Reade, the trial judge, imposed 27 years instead.\nBut Reade did more than impose a disproportionate sentence. After Rubashkin\u2019s conviction and sentence, defense lawyers learned that Reade, over a six-month period, had been actively engaged in planning the Agriprocessors raid. Emails and affidavits showed that, long before the raid occurred, Reade met with ICE agents to discuss \u201ccharging strategies, numbers of anticipated arrests and prosecutions, logistics, the movement of detainees, and other issues related\u201d to the investigation and operation. At one meeting, which law-enforcement personnel attended at the judge\u2019s request, the judge stated that she was \u201c"}

The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt.\nThe Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That\u2019s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1.\nThomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with.\nAt the higher end of the spectrum, Pew Research cited a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median).\nThere\u2019s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren\u2019t as well represented.\nOverall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us.\nMenendez said, \"A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession.\" A study from the Urban Institute supports her statistic. Other research shows an even wider gap, further proving her point that race is a factor in U.S. wealth.\nMenendez's statement is accurate, and might even understate the issue. We rate her claim True.\nPublished: Sunday, April 27th, 2014 at 4:02 p.m."}

Barring a couple of flashbacks, both film and book restrict themselves to a single, crushing day in Billy\u2019s life. Here, playwright Robert Allan Evans asks: what happened to him the next day? And the day after that?\nDesigner Max Johns\u2019s set is a masterpiece of neglect: rotting chairs, industrial junk, an upturned bicycle straddling two filing-cabinets. A battered radio recites the commentary from a decades-old race, but the names of the horses (\u201cCrackpot,\u201d \u201cArthritis\u201d) take on new meaning in this later phase of Billy\u2019s life.\nAmid this wreckage, a haggard, middle-aged Billy (Jack Lord) finds the glove he once wore to train his beloved kestrel, Kes. Slipping it on, he summons the ghost of his childhood (Dan Parr). Together they relive his memories; Parr remains the teenager, while elder Billy acts out every other role, from his chain-smoking, promiscuous mother to his brutal headmaster, often slipping out of character to laugh with his younger self.\nThis is a powerful device, and it creates some moments of intense pathos. \u201cYou think a lot about that bird, don\u2019t you?\u201d asks Lord, as Billy\u2019s teacher. \u201cCourse I do,\u201d snorts the boy. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you, if it wa\u2019 yours?\u201d The older man is speechless. It was his, of course \u2013 once.\nBoth Lord and Parr turn in energetic, committed and largely convincing performances, but where everything falls down, however, is the kestrel. Having trained with real birds of prey, both actors are independently capable of miming how to hold the unseen bird, spinning the lure with technical accuracy. But director Amy Leach misjudges the moment of flight itself, asking both actors to swivel and gasp in unison, swooping left and right as the bird flies past. Each performance undermines the other - their synchronised goggling is one stylised step too far, and the scenes fail to reach the emotional heights they aim for.\nEvans\u2019s inventive adaptation (first seen in 2011) has much to admire \u2013 but not the qualities Kes is usually loved for.

This staging might be beautiful and intelligent, but it misses Kes\u2019s naturalistic heart.\nAfter its run at the Playhouse, Leach\u2019s production will tour community venues around Leeds (including a sign-language performance at Hawksworth Wood\u2019s YMCA).

But it's fair to say he had rather loftier ambitions.\nSo lofty, in fact, it led him from his birthplace in Maidstone, in 1900, to standing higher than any other man ever had.\nAbsorbed by the majesty, and challenge, of mountains, he became a highly respected mountaineer.\nIn 1931 he conquered Kamet in northern India - the highest peak, at that point, ever to have been climbed.\nIt inevitably led him to attempt to reach the peak of Everest two years later. He reached 28,200ft - a pre-war altitude record - but could not complete the climb. He would make two further efforts - both unsuccessful.\nHe returned to the Himalayas in 1949, but after suffering bouts of malaria, died at the age of 48.\nWe take for granted today that if anyone finds themselves in trouble at sea, a rescue team will be dispatched in a lifeboat in an effort to pull them to safety.\nAnd while some experimentation may have taken a place a few years before, we have a man who died in Hythe in 1834 to thank.\nLionel Lukin built on a boat concept tested in France to create a boat which was incapable of sinking.\nAccording to the RNLI, although a coachbuilder, Lukin was interested in improving the safety of boats.\nIn 1784 he began experimenting with a Norwegian yawl, a type of sailing boat, using the River Thames to test his \u2018unimmergible\u2019 design.

Until then, plenty of other data can be transmitted to Earth for scientific analysis.\nNASA looked at around 30 possible sites for the rover landing before settling with Jezero Crater.

Curiosity has managed to overcome occasional issues to continue its work there, exploring the surface of the red planet and sending back data for analysis. Earlier this year, Curiosity discovered methane and other organic compounds that serve as the foundations of life, marking the first time for scientists to gather reliable evidence of the existence of organic compounds on Mars.\nIn more Mars-related news, NASA is just days away from another major event \u2014 the arrival of its InSight robotic lander.

The production was a part of a student run organization on campus called Shakespeare in the Dark. SITD puts on student directed productions of different Shakespeare plays. The director was Stephen Dunford, a senior and a fellow theater major. He cast me and two other girls as the part of Ariel. We represented the three elements: earth, fire, and rain. I had the pleasure of playing earth Ariel. It was a very interesting and eye opening experience.\nI also had the opportunity to be in a scene in the directors workshop class production of \u201cThe Good Doctor.\u201d It is a play written by Neil Simon based off of Anton Chekov\u2019s short stories. I was the wife Sonya in the first scene entitled \u201cThe Sneeze.\u201d In my own opinion, it was hilarious. Well, the show was hilarious.

People were turned away at the door every night, it was just that popular! I have never had the experience of working on a show from a tech angle. I can safely say that I am a) not that great at it, and b) that I would much rather be on stage singing with the cast. But it was an all together fun time. The crew danced up in the balcony with the cast and sang along while we ran cues for the show. We felt like we were as much a part of the show as the actors were. I strongly suggest that everyone should have their own tech experience. Seriously.\nBut enough about this semester and what I\u2019ve been up to. With graduation yesterday and senior year looming, there are so many things to think about. On the last night before I left for home I was sitting on a friends porch watching a thunderstorm.

The whole conversation really got me thinking. William and Mary has made so many things possible for me. It has opened so many doors for friends of mine.

The difference is that FAS modules use the Lisp programming language for its script, instead of VisualBasic or PowerShell, the preferred scripting component used with macros.\nBased on the victim's AutoCAD installation settings, the AutoCAD app will either automatically execute these .fas scripting modules when the user opens the main .cad project, or when the user opens any .cad project.\nRecent versions of the AutoCAD software (versions released after 2014) show warnings when executing a .fas module, but just like with the macro warnings in Office apps, some usually tend to plow through all the security alerts without thinking of the consequences and to open and view the main file's content as soon as possible.\n\"We have tracked and analysed a large number (over 200 data sets and about 40 unique malicious modules) of 'acad.fas' versions in the past few months, from what looks like an extended campaign based around a small downloader component,\" Forcepoint said.\nCurrently, it's unclear how the rest of the operation plays out. Researchers say that the malicious \"acad.fas\" modules they've observed would attempt to connect to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server to download other malware, but they haven't been able to determine what this subsequent malware was.\n\"It is unclear whether this was a result of additional server-side checks in place to facilitate the targeting of specific victims or if it is merely an artefact of the campaign currently being 'inactive',\" researchers said.\nThey did say that the group behind this campaign appears to be an avid user of AutoCAD-based malware,"}

Jim Carroll has been nominated to lead ONDCP which has yet to have a director more than a year into President Trump's tenure, despite Mr. Trump's claims that fighting the opioid crisis is a top priority.\nA White House official claimed to CBS News' Katiana Krawchenko the move has nothing to do with the politics of what's happening with Kelly. The White House is working to quash reports that Kelly is willing to resign over his response to allegations of domestic abuse leveled against top White House aide Rob Porter.\n\"The president intends to nominate Jim Carroll to serve as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the White House press pool. \"We have full confidence in Jim to lead ONDCP to make significant strides in combatting the opioids crisis, reducing drug use, and coordinating U.S. drug policy.

We greatly appreciate Jim for his counsel and leadership during his tenure at the White House and look forward to the future contributions he will make in this new role.\"\nCNN first reported the news of Carroll's departure.\nThat source said Carroll's move has to do with his experience in prosecuting drug-related crimes.\n\"The ONDCP is an open sore here frankly, and that's what's driven this,\" the source said.\nMr. Trump has said combatting the opioid epidemic is key to his administration, but critics have said his actions don't match his words.\nA source told CBS News's Jacqueline Alemany last month that the president plans on basically gutting ONDCP by slashing more than $340 million from its budget. The proposed cuts by the Office of Management and budget are a part of plans to effectively dismantle the office by nixing hits grant-making capabilities. The president is expected to release his budget proposal as early as Monday.\nONDCP has been hamstrung since Mr. Trump took office as he has yet to nominate a new director, informally known as the nation's drug czar. Mr. Trump has also made some questionable staffing appointments. The Washington Post reported last month that a 24-year-old former campaign staffer was serving as the second in command at ONDCP.\nMr. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency in October, but the White House has not formally asked Congress for any additional funding towards the crisis.\nThe president's earlier nominee for drug czar, Tom Marino, withdrew his name for consideration in October after a joint investigation by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" and The Washington Post found Marino advocated for helping disarm the Drug Enforcement Administration at the height of the opioid crisis.

A decision on whether Lewis will face the death penalty has not been determined yet.\nKansas City, Kan., Police Chief Terry Zeigler says the series of events that led to the death of Captain Dave Melton began Tuesday, July 19, when a citizen called police to report three or four young men inside a burgundy Grand Prix shooting a gun in the area of 2nd and Edgerton. DA Gorman said a 9 mm handgun was used at that crime scene.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some kind of ongoing problem between Lewis and Sipple and another group of people and police are still trying to run that down,\u201d Gorman explained.\nShortly thereafter, an officer who was on routine patrol saw a burgundy Grand Prix near 15th and Haskell driving the wrong way. The officer went after the vehicle to stop it for the traffic violation, but the driver fled.\nThe officer briefly pursued the car, but then stopped because the nature of the crime was only a traffic violation. At that time, the description of the suspect\u2019s vehicle from the shooting had not yet been broadcast to the officers in the field.\nOnce it was a few minutes later, officers on patrol located the vehicle in the area of 15th and Rowland. The officer provided a description of the suspects, who eventually bailed from the vehicle and took off running on foot. When they bailed from the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle was taken into custody immediately without incident.\nWhen Sipple was taken into custody, the officer believed he still had a gun on him and caused the officer to fear for his life \u2014 which resulted in an aggravated assault of law enforcement charge, according to officials.\nCaptain Melton was out on patrol in the area of 22nd and Georgia when he heard the 911 call and went to assist. At 1:58 p.m., Captain Melton and another officer spotted a suspect near 22nd and Georgia. Captain Melton sped to the suspect location, cutting him off, or boxing him in with his police vehicle.\n\u201cThe suspect produced a handgun and fired several shots into the passenger side of Captain Melton\u2019s patrol car through the window, which was halfway down. At the time of the shooting, Captain Melton was trying to exit his patrol car to engage the suspect. Captain Melton was shot several times and officers at the scene begin rendering aid immediately,\u201d said Chief Zeigler.\nChief Zeigler said Captain Melton was wearing his protective vest at the time. Gorman said a .40 caliber pistol was the weapon used to kill him.\nCaptain Melton was taken to the hospital \u201cwhere he ended his watch\u201d at approximately 2:55 p.m.\nMelton leaves behind three children, and was expecting a fourth child with his girlfriend.

Cape Town native Michael Matthews lovingly cribs from the Sergios \u2014 both Leone and Corbucci \u2014 to craft a craggy, gutbucket epic full of slightly silly, mythopoetic grandeur and a tart taste of regional politics. It\u2019s amazing how well some tropes travel.\nWe begin with a stark, circular standoff that\u2019ll look awfully familiar to fans of \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d that is until Matthews reveals we\u2019re watching a bunch of children playing around with slingshots. A lengthy prologue establishes these young friends as a self-styled gang of preteen guerrillas, calling themselves the Five Fingers while taunting Afrikaner cops and pelting them with eggs. But in such a volatile environment mischief can quickly get out of hand, one afternoon escalating with swift and sickening inevitability until the group\u2019s leader Tau \u2014 nicknamed the Lion of Marseilles \u2014 makes a deadly decision that will reverberate for decades.\nThe movie jumps ahead 20 years or so, and though the colonists might be gone, nature abhors a vacuum. Tau\u2019s old hometown is now in the death grip of a virulently nasty crime boss called Ghost (a horrifying Hamilton Dlamini) while his old pal Pockets (Kenneth Nkosi) is the crooked mayor of New Marseilles, an up-and-coming city down the hill built on shady deals and bad promises. Their bullied buddy Cockroach (Mduduzi Mabaso), like so many picked-on kids before him, has grown up to be a sadistic cop who would much rather settle old scores than serve and protect.\nInto all of this returns the Lion of Marseilles, looking for his long-dead brother and instead finding a resentful nephew (Lizwi Vilakazi) and sister-in-law (Zethu Dlomo) who can barely stand the sight of him. Played by an eloquently taciturn Vuyo Dabula, the grown-up Tau brings with him a larger-than-life reputation full of prison stints and armed banditry, but these days he\u2019s just looking for a place where he can hang up his guns for good.

{"idx": "20957", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The rumour that I have undergone a brain transplant is (as far as I can remember) unfounded - or at least premature. But my thinking about the current Middle East crisis and its protagonists has in fact radically changed during the past two years. I imagine that I feel a bit like one of those western fellow travellers rudely awakened by the trundle of Russian tanks crashing through Budapest in 1956.\nBack in 1993, when I began work on Righteous Victims, a revisionist history of the Zionist-Arab conflict from 1881 until the present, I was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for Middle East peace. I was never a wild optimist; and my gradual study during the mid-1990s of the pre-1948 history of Palestinian-Zionist relations brought home to me the depth and breadth of the problems and antagonisms. But at least the Israelis and Palestinians were talking peace; had agreed to mutual recognition; and had signed the Oslo agreement, a first step that promised gradual Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, the emergence of a Palestinian state, and a peace treaty between the two peoples. The Palestinians appeared to have given up their decades-old dream and objective of destroying and supplanting the Jewish state, and the Israelis had given up their dream of a \"Greater Israel\", stretching from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river. And, given the centrality of Palestinian-Israeli relations in the Arab-Israeli conflict, a final, comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and all of its Arab neighbours seemed within reach.\nBut by the time I had completed the book, my restrained optimism had given way to grave doubts - and within a year had crumbled into a cosmic pessimism. One reason was the Syrians' rejection of the deal offered by the prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1993-96 and Ehud Barak in 1999-2000, involving Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for a full-fledged bilateral peace treaty. What appears to have stayed the hands of President Hafez Assad and subsequently his son and successor, Bashar Assad, was not quibbles about a few hundred yards here or there but a basic refusal to make peace with the Jewish state.

That's the timetable.\"\nRettig made his debut in a less-than-ideal circumstance, taking his first snap with the Eagles in a 7-0 hole.\nIt didn't get much better. Before Retting had played a full quarter as a starter, he faced a 21-0 deficit. And a left ankle injury sent him to the locker room before he could complete a half.\nHe did not return to the game.\nHis first pass, which would have picked up a first down, was thrown behind receiver Clyde Lee. It wasn't the only errant throw. Some were dropped. Another was nearly intercepted. And his first completion, on a third-and-23, lost a yard.\nStill, Rettig threw his first touchdown late in the quarter when wide receiver Bobby Swigert slipped behind ND cornerback Gary Gray and caught a 58-yard touchdown pass.\nRettig, however, suffered an ankle injury and was replaced in the second quarter by Marscovetra. With Marscovetra under center, the Eagles kicked field goals on consecutive drives to cut the deficit to 21-13 before a David Ruffer field goal made it a 24-13 ND halftime lead.\nRettig complete 5 of 10 passes and the touchdown in the first half while Marscovetra connected on 4 of 7.\nThe Notre Dame-Boston College series has included some testy moments through the years.\nEagles players have taken home chunks of the ND Stadium grass as souvenirs after victories, and the BC media release this week pointed out that in the 1992 game, with ND up multiple touchdowns, Lou Holtz called a fake punt leading to another score in a 54-7 Irish victory.\nYes, it's still a heated rivalry, but the two teams have been able to put the game in perspective.

Elsbeth Martindale, PsyD, has created a wonderful tool, How to Spot a Bully card deck. Dr. Martindale reached out to me (and was generous enough to send me a deck for my review). I was so impressed with How to Spot a Bully I wanted to share my thoughts with all of you.\nThe deck comes with directions that are simple to follow: the dark teal cards ask the child questions to help them determine if their conflict with a peer(s) could be considered bullying. While working with a student, you can give them the teal cards and ask them separate them into three piles, \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d and, \u201cunsure.\u201d If the child is unsure of their answer, Dr. Martindale thoughtfully asks more specific questions on the back of each teal card to help them answer the main question on the front. The child then is asked to put the card in the appropriate pile according to their answer. From there you can help the child understand why they put their card in certain piles.\nIf the child finds themselves as a target, bystander or bully the deck has three solution decks for each role! I particularly like the solution deck for the bully. Dr. Martindale expresses empathy for the bullying child and helps them understand their behavior from the outside.\nI can see using this tool quite effectively with children from Kindergarden to 5th grade. Not only can you come up with a solution but you can use the cards to further explore issues of self-esteem, aggression and conflict resolution with the child you are working with. With some creativity, the use of these cards could be endless!\nIf you would like to know more about How to Spot a Bully or Dr. Martindale, please see her website at Courage to Bloom."}

They must recognize and resolve an ethical dilemma when they encounter one. These skills are developed through the study of the liberal arts, which we are infusing across the curriculum of our professional programs.\nThis is the basis for our proposal for a new kind of regional university, which I unveiled in November. We will integrate liberal arts into majors that prepare our students for professional opportunity and advancement. We will deliver programs aligned with the career-focused goals of our students and the needs of regional communities and businesses. We will broaden access to lifelong learning, including partnerships with local employers and schools.\nWe are leading the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point through necessary change in a way that is responsive to student needs and relevant to regional issues. Our new vision is being driven by the expectations of students and parents. Our students are focused on the cost of higher education and the return they\u2019re going to get on their investment. They are looking for careers with many paths and for skills they need to succeed in a future we can only imagine.\nfocus on strengths and prioritize programs that best meet the needs of our students and north central Wisconsin communities.\nproduce graduates who have specific skills as well as the capacity to evolve and innovate with changing circumstances.\nenvision education as a lifelong process and serve students of all ages.\ninvolve our students and faculty members beyond the classroom, working in the best tradition of the Wisconsin Idea to understand and solve regional problems.\nOne of the ways our new regional university will partner with the community is through a new Center for Critical Thinking. Existing faculty members from various departments will be able to offer training to local high schools, employers, nonprofits and other community partners, based on their professional development needs.\nThis model for a new regional university will put UW-Stevens Point on a successful, sustainable path for the future. It will also help address the fiscal challenges we have been tackling for several years in the wake of declining state support and lower enrollment. We have already trimmed $7.6 million from our budget since 2014 without cutting academic programs. Instead, we have cut operating expenses, improved efficiencies and reduced staffing by 89 full-time equivalent positions, largely through attrition.\nWhen staffing reductions were needed in recent years, we were fortunate to absorb this almost entirely through retirements and other voluntary separations with no tenured faculty layoffs. Employers here and everywhere have faced the challenge of staff reductions, so many will understand how difficult changes are when they involve our colleagues, friends and neighbors.\nRestructuring our academic programs is primarily designed to attract and retain students, thereby increasing enrollment and revenue, as well as reducing expenses. We propose discontinuing six majors with low or declining enrollment while continuing to offer more than 100 majors and emphases within these majors. This will allow short-term spending reductions to stabilize our budget.\nUW-Stevens Point is committed to helping our students find and achieve their personal and professional goals. We will do so with fewer majors but no less dedication to guiding students to degree programs that provide the skills they need to succeed in their career choice and as engaged citizens.\nOur graduates will become among the best-prepared professionals in Wisconsin, giving them a competitive edge not only in their careers but in life.\nBernie P"}

Die Mannschaft, which literally translates into 'The Team', was unequivocally the team of the tournament.\nAnd in the narrowness of their one goal victory over Argentina in the final, there lie a generous width of ideas, pertinent to anybody involved in creating effective teams. In their style of designing world class automobiles, the Germans this World Cup, also shed some light on engineering world beating teams.\nTen years ago, Germany had a disastrous outing at the European Championships in Portugal. They were knocked out at the initial group stage. It was truly a low point in their footballing history. The consensus seemed to be, the talent had dried up in German game. At such times, most teams tend to embrace a defensive approach to stay competitive. But two German coaches turned this conventional idea on its head, first Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006, and subsequently Joachim Low (who began as Klinsmann's acolyte).\nIn every tournament, beginning with the 2006 World Cup, the Germans came out flying. They not only scored goals by the bagful, they even began transforming a dour stodginess, in the perception about the German team. They became the most exciting team on the planet. Their attacking intent also presented them the onus early on in matches, and soon they began to chalk up an impressive record.\nMany times organizations trying to turn the corner become more and more defensive in their strategies. This results in an adherence to 'tried and trusted' procedures, quite a few of which might be responsible, for landing the company in that predicament in the first place. To dramatically turn things around, bravery in one's strategic and executional approach, is often the need of the hour. It can catch competitors off guard. It can inspire belief in the team within. It can provide the organizational momentum to get out of tough situations. It can ensure there is always joy to be had, when the final whistle blows.\nPrevious German teams used to largely (if not exclusively) feature players of pure German ethnicity. But this new exciting revolution in German football; will also be remembered for the manner in which players, who had a dual heritage, began to feature regularly and prominently.\nThere is a distinct 'United Nations' feel to the German national team these days. Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski are part Polish. Mesut Ozil is of Turkish descent. Jerome Boateng has a Ghanaian father. Sami Khedira has Tunisians roots. And these players have opened the doors for many others.\nAny ecosystem is richer for the variance it possesses. The same is true for teams in any organization.

On Thursday, they searched his home to gather \"evidence to link him to the various robberies,\" Agent Weinhold said.\nPolice said they seized drugs and a .22-caliber rifle. They issued an arrest warrant charging Mr. Grace with six counts of drug possession and being a felon in possession of a firearm. They were searching for him last night.\nThe Harborplace holdups, which occurred in August and September, frightened many of the 200 merchants at the Light and Pratt street pavilions.

The fund is replenished by gas tax revenues, which have dried up as Americans have driven less and used more fuel-efficient cars.\nNormally, states are given an allotment of funds that they are allowed to draw on throughout the year.\n\"States will be paid, not as they send their bills in, but every two weeks as money from the gas tax comes in,'' Foxx told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.\nFoxx urged Congress to replenish the fund by ending tax breaks and using the revenues to set aside money to repair the nation's infrastructure. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated needs for highway repair at $8.1 billion for the rest of the year.\nYet even though there is bipartisan support for increased spending on infrastructure, Democrats and Republicans disagree on how to pay for it.\nIf Congress remains stuck over the issue, the consequences could be huge,halting or slowing work on thousands of projects.\nThis could idle hundreds of thousands of workers at a time when the U.S. economy is finally gaining some traction.\nThe situation parallels the numerous \"cliffs\" that Congress has faced in the recent past, with a looming deadline and potentially dire economic consequences.\nLast week, the Senate Finance Committee began work on an $8 billion, stopgap measure aimed at shoring up the trust fund until the end of the year.

As it hit with a force equivalent to more than 100m megatons of TNT, or about 1,500 times the total content of the world's present nuclear arsenals, the asteroid sent a vast cloud of scalding vapour thousands of miles in all directions, and blasted more than 50 times its own mass of pulverised rock high into the sky where, as tiny particles, it incandesced and heated the entire atmosphere to several hundred degrees centigrade, killing almost everything unprotected by soil, rock or deep water. Many scientists believe that about three-quarters of animals, including the pterosaurs, the mosasaurs and, as every child now knows, the non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out as a result. It took millions of years for life to recover and surpass its previous diversity, this time with a new ensemble of species that included our distant ancestors. This event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (and formerly as the Cretaceous-Tertiary) extinction, is counted as one of five mass extinctions over the last 500m years or so, where a mass extinction is defined as an event in which a significant proportion of life is eliminated in a geologically insignificant amount of time.\nAt first glance, the footprint of industrialised humanity on the biosphere may look small compared with that of the Chicxulub asteroid. The additional input of heat into the world's oceans resulting from greenhouse gases put there by the combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is equivalent to only about four atomic bomb detonations, or well under a tenth of a megaton per second. But first glances are sometimes misleading. Humans are affecting the Earth system in many ways, and have been doing so every moment for decades and indeed centuries. It may seem like a diffuse, drawn-out affair to us as individuals but compared with many natural processes (for which animals and plants are, in Jacob Bronowski's phrase, equipped with \"exact and beautiful adaptations\"), it is virtually instantaneous. Perhaps the current transformation will turn out to be more like the end-Permian 252m years ago, the third of the \"big five\" extinctions, which is thought to have been kicked off by massive pulses of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, each of which lasted only a few decades, but which together resulted in the death of up to 95% of all life.\nOr not. A lot is uncertain. What is beyond reasonable doubt is that something big is under way. The best estimates are that the Earth is losing species at many times the background rate (the natural churn in which a few species go extinct every year while new ones evolve), and that 30% to 50% will be functionally extinct by 2050.\nThe plight of the non-human world has inspired many works of popular science over the last 20 years or so.

This time, it aims to raise about double the amount it did last time, and it most likely won't need to halve its deal size.\nDespite investor concerns about the risks within China's shadow banking sector, which China Commercial Credit is a part of, most industry insiders caution against exaggerating the downside.\nThe consensus right now is that China won't repeat the disasters of 2008.\n\"(Highly risky loans) among microcredit companies (in China) are not widespread,\" Qin Huichun, CEO of China Commercial Credit, tells China Money Network in a phone interview from the company's office in Wujiang district in Suzhou.\nAll of China Commercial Credit's loans are secured with real assets as collateral. As a comparison, about 80% to 90% of loans under $1 million in the U.S. is secured with collateral in 2013, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nMoreover, China Commercial Credit's average loan size is very small, close to RMB2 million ($333,000), while its annual interest rate was around 14.6%, says Qin.\nGranted, with around 8,000 microcredit companies in China with RMB800 billion outstanding loans, the size of the microcredit industry is negligible in China's shadow banking system.\nThe total assets in the Chinese shadow banking sector is around RMB46 trillion, according to JPMorgan Chase estimates. Gao Hua Securities puts it at RMB28.5 trillion.\nMore importantly, the ratio of shadow banking to total bank assets in China stands at 30%, comfortably low compared to 170% in the U.S. and 150% in the Netherlands, JPMorgan's analysis shows.\nLast month, China's State Council released a document for the first time, outlining measures on how to contain risks related to shadow banking. It concluded that risks are \"overall manageable,\" without giving details.\nBut the document did define what the Chinese government considers as shadow banking. It categorizes the space into three types. The first includes third-party wealth management products and trust companies, or financial institutions without licenses and no regulatory oversight.\nThe second category is credit guarantee companies, microcredit firms, or those without licenses and partially regulated. The last type includes entities with licenses but have inadequate regulation, such as money market funds, securitized products, and off-balance-sheet products.\nThe biggest immediate risk may erupt from wealth management products used as financing platforms for risky corporates.

All I can say is it's clearly been purified!\nThere's nobody here for the money! There are no foundation executives or other careerists! We don't have that problem!\nYou are all here out of pure principle. And the fact is that the late, great American Conservative Movement used to be like this. I'm old enough to remember. I emigrated to it in 1970. This is how it used to be.\nAt one point at Forbes, I used to interview every year Milton Friedman, the great free market economist, who was actually also a great man. (Although I realize that he has critics here, Tom! [Piatak\u2014see here]) And he once said to me, in the mid-nineties, that it was to his great surprise late in his long life\u2014and he was 94 when he died\u2014that he had suddenly started to meet stupid libertarians\u2014stupid free market economists.\nHe said that, when he was a young man on the campuses, starting a career, he just didn't meet stupid libertarians, because they were winkled out by evolutionary pressure. So those remaining were, all of them, very smart. Of course, they were frequently mad, but that's a different matter. They were smart.\nAnd I think that\u2014putting aside the madness!\u2014we can see that in this conference. This is a conference where the audience really matters. Looking around the room, I'm struck with the high quality of the individuals here. There are a lot of you making real contributions. That's not what you'd find nowadays in what's left of the conservative movement, a conference held by the conservative establishment.\n\"This is the most extraordinary collection of human knowledge that's ever been gathered at the White House with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\"\nSo I was thinking what American statesman dining alone should we all be compared with. Jefferson Davis? [Laugher from Southern caucus] I'll give you the answer later.\nThe theme of the conference is \"The Egalitarian Temptation\". And I'm here to talk about equality and immigration.\nNow, being English, I don't have Paul's Germanic bent for abstract philosophy. In fact, abstractions give me the creeps. I'll leave this to Lydia, the philosophy graduate. It's facts, rather than philosophy, that motivate me.\nAnd I'm going to prove that by promptly fleeing from the title and digressing to briefly discuss the presidential election, because that does relate to immigration. Quite obviously American politics are being substantially driven by immigration and the resulting demographic change.\n"}

{"idx": "20990", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Most California oil wells, like these, bring up large amounts of salty water with the oil, and that water must be disposed of once the oil has been removed. Oil companies have been getting rid of some of that waste water by injecting it into aquifers that were supposed to be protected by law, the subject of a lawsuit filed Thursday.\nTwo environmental groups sued California regulators Thursday to stop oil companies from injecting wastewater into potentially usable aquifers beneath the state\u2019s drought-ravaged Central Valley.\nThe suit, filed by the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, claims the California agency that oversees oil fields is breaking the law by letting companies pump wastewater from their drilling operations into aquifers that the regulators were supposed to protect. The injections were the subject of a Chronicle investigation in February.\nThe state\u2019s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) has moved to end the practice but has given oil companies until 2017 to shut down many of the injection wells. Environmentalists want all the wells closed immediately. The groups sued Thursday to overturn newly adopted regulations from the division that allow the continued injections.\nThe division declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nThe suit follows revelations that the division for years allowed oil companies to inject billions of barrels of water left over from oil pumping operations into aquifers that could have been used for drinking or irrigation. So far, no drinking-water wells have been found to be contaminated by the injections.\nCalifornia\u2019s oil reservoirs contain large amounts of salty water that must be separated from the petroleum and disposed of, usually by pumping it back underground. In 176 cases, the division let companies inject this \u201cproduced water\u201d into high-quality aquifers \u2014 potentially clean enough to drink \u2014 that were supposed to be protected under federal law. Another 356 injection wells went into aquifers whose water could have been used with more extensive treatment.\nIn addition, the division improperly issued permits for about 2,000 wells that are pumping water or steam into aquifers that also contain oil, as a way of squeezing more petroleum out of the ground.\nThe injections angered federal and state officials, and the division\u2019s newly installed director, Steven Bohlen, promised to end them. Twenty-three injection wells believed to pose the greatest risk to drinking water supplies have already been shut.\nFor the rest, however, the division set up a two-year closure schedule, with some allowed to operate until Feb. 15, 2017.\nThat lead time will give oil companies a chance to convince both the division and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that some of the aquifers \u2014 particularly those that also contain oil \u2014 should be considered suitable places either to dump produced water or inject steam to extract the petroleum. The EPA has the authority to declare an aquifer exempt from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, making it eligible for wastewater injections.\nSome aquifers, however, aren\u2019t likely to receive an EPA exemption. In those cases, the 2017 deadline will give oil companies time to find other ways to get rid of their produced water, either by injecting it into one of the aquifers that the EPA has already declared exempt or by treating it on the surface.\nOil companies consider the two-year timetable short, but workable. Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association trade group, said the division\u2019s plan should be given a chance"}

Big Tech companies are finally wising up to the fact that free can be fatal.\nI grew up with Chinese immigrant parents whose life ethos manifested the notion that you work hard for what you need, because nothing is free in this world.\nIn my adult life, I still tend to look a gift horse in the mouth and am suspicious of freebies and too generous offers. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is just that. Stay away.\nBut like many other modern citizens of a rich, industrialised, interconnected world, I've been seduced by the flood of freebies I get on the Internet. Information is free. Entertainment in the form of countless articles and videos is free. Search is free.\nGoogle puts the wealth of centuries of research and knowledge literally at my fingertips, condensed into bite-sized, graphical and relevant information. I expect Google to read my mind when I key in a few words and to know precisely what about \"big tech safe harbour\" or \"singlit poetry wrestling\" I need to know to edit or write an article.\nI expect its algorithms and bots to trawl through millions of Web pages and sites to deliver the handful of pithy, relevant articles I need to read to get up to speed on a subject. I expect the information delivered in three seconds, and I expect it free.\nBut as some have warned, and many of the rest of us are just discovering, nothing is really free. Not even information or search results. We use Google to search for information we want online. We use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with friends and share photos and updates. It's all free.\nBut when something is free, often someone, somewhere, is paying the price. And in a roundabout way, the price often comes back to us.\nLet's talk about search results. Who is paying the price of that free search?\nWe all are - by handing over our browsing history and personal information. Google tracks each site you visit; it may also have your contacts and your credit card details. Each of us becomes a potential customer for an ad that Google sells to advertisers.\nIf a shampoo-seller wants to advertise a hair product for women who want more lustrous hair, Google might notice that I'd been searching \"what to do with thinning hair\" or \"how to style my hair so it looks fuller\" and serve me up as a customer for that shampoo-seller.\nInternet users are in effect handing over their personal information and preferences, and allowing sites such as Google and Facebook to monetise their Internet-browsing habits.\nHow about the information that goes into those search results?\nWho's spending time researching, and writing, about \"big tech safe harbour\" laws, for example?

Of course nobody talked about gay people back then. That's what made it such a totally wild story.\nBut if the NFL is not ready now, it should be. Come on, how many years has it been? In 1968 Jerry [Smith] -- Mr. Touchdown with the Redskins -- was out more than I was.

It's amazing.\nI've been blessed in being able to contribute to this issue and speak up for myself and others. I wish Jerry was alive to see it. I feel bad about that. When I came out it put him in a very difficult position, but I was just reacting like any player when someone's trying to knock your head off. Life puts you sometimes in a strange position and you just have to go for it.

I'd say the most important thing is that he's the president.\nOf course, bigots, by definition of the term bigot, do try to define people by a single word, in this case: gay.
