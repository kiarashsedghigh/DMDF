Malaysia is an immature and cost competitive market, it said.\nThe study provides cost comparisons in major offshore and nearshore markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Egypt, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore and South Africa.\nLatin America provides the lowest offshore agent price while Canada and South Africa are the most costly locations.\nAccording to Datamonitor, Argentina, Brazil and Chile provide the lowest fully loaded call center agent price point among all offshore locations examined in the study.\nDue to a large, scalable labor force, growing multilingual capabilities and proactive domestic players, offshore investors will find good customer care prospects in each of these countries.\nMexico, despite being slightly more expensive, is also cost-effective.\nConversely, Canada and South Africa are significantly more expensive on a per agent basis. South Africa remains the highest cost location, due to agent sophistication and the appreciation of the local currency.\nBut, Datamonitor Call Center and CRM Analyst Peter Ryan said this is not all bad news for these locations. ''Considering the legacy of contact center offshoring in both Canada and South Africa, investors will pay a higher price per agent, however they will generally be guaranteed an excellent quality of labor as well as technology that is second to none,'' he said.\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Egypt remains the most price competitive market due to its scalability and relative immaturity.\nThe report assessed contact center expenses, breaking them out into salary, benefits, property costs, IT and Telecommunications and taxation and foreign exchange.\n''Cost management is a huge problem for many offshore contact center investors and in most cases this is unnecessary. By being able to predict where costs will rise as a percent of total expense based on current trends, prudent financial management and healthy bottom lines should not be difficult outcomes,'' Ryan added."}

The 2018 Honda Activa-i scooter comes with cosmetic upgrades and new colour options over the previous version and also gets a marginal price hike. The Activa-i joins the list of updated models in Honda's two-wheeler fleet. The company had announced earlier this year that it will be rolling out upgrades for 18 of its existing models in FY2018-19, while one new two-wheeler will also be launched in the current fiscal.\nWith respect to the upgrades, the 2018 Honda Activa-i comes with a revised instrument cluster, metallic exhaust muffler, front storage hook and new body graphics. The four-in-one ignition feature, first introduced on the Honda Grazia last year and subsequently in other Honda scooters, also makes it to the 2018 Activa-i. As part of the 2018 update, the scooter gets five new colours - Candy Jazzy Blue, Imperial Red Metallic, Lush Magneta Metallic, Orchid Purple Metallic and Mat Axis Grey Metallic.\nThere are no changes to the engine however. Power continues to come from the same 109 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled engine tuned to produce 8 bhp at 7000 rpm and 9 Nm of peak torque at 5500 rpm, while mated to a CVT unit. The scooter rides on tubeless tyres, while braking performance comes with 130 mm drum brakes at either end. The scooter also gets Combi-Braking System (CBS) as standard.\nThe Honda Activa-i was launched in 2013 as an entry-level offering in the Activa range. The scooter takes on a host of other offerings in this space including the Hero Pleasure, TVS Scooty Zest, Suzuki Let's and the likes. The Activa-i though, remains overshadowed by the Honda Activa 5G in the range, given the original model's popularity and the addition of a metal body instead of a fibre body."}

Our national parks may be the last of the true bargains.\nThey were never intended to be a money-making proposition, and should not be converted into one.\nZinke has suggested fees charged to enter some parks should be increased substantially. New funding is needed to address the National Park Service\u2019s $11 billion maintenance backlog, he explains.\nIn testimony before a congressional committee, Zinke noted that an annual pass allowing admittance to all parks costs just $80 a year. Senior citizens can get lifetime passes for that much.\nThat certainly is true \u2014 for those who have $80 to spare. Some people don\u2019t.\nZinke\u2019s idea is that one-time admission to popular parks, such as Yellowstone and Grand Canyon, should cost as much as $70 per vehicle. Presumably, he thinks the annual and senior citizen passes should be priced higher, too.\nTo some extent, fees are a good idea to help maintain parks. It makes sense that people who use certain public facilities should bear more of the cost of keeping them in good condition.\nThere needs to be a limit, however. Our parks were intended to be places of recreation, relaxation and education for all Americans.

Epic Games used a striking demo at a Game Developers Conference keynote presentation this morning to show just how much better raytracing can make real-time, interactive graphics look with top-of-the-line hardware right now.\nWith raytracing, developers can change the shape of the light in a scene on the fly, in turn changing the character and the diffuse \u201csoftness\u201d of the shadows in the scene. The way the raytraced shadows allow for gentle gradations of light as characters and objects block parts of the scene is one of the most apparent improvements over the harsher, \u201cpre-baked\u201d light in rasterized graphics. The raytracing technology also gives the scene a realistic, cinematic depth-of field effect automatically, with no need for fancy shaders or tricks implemented manually by developers.\nGetting a \u201ccinematic\u201d 24fps with real-time raytracing still requires some serious hardware: it\u2019s currently running on Nvidia\u2019s ultra-high-end, four-GPU DGX Station, which lists for $60,000 [Update: After publication, Epic reached out to clarify that the demo was running on a DGX Station, and not a DGX-1 as originally stated during the interview.] . Even with that, some elements of the scene, like the walls, need to be rasterized rather than made fully reflective, Libreri told Ars. And the Volta technology that is key to powering this kind of performance isn't even available in consumer-grade GPUs below the $3,000+ Titan V, so don't expect this kind of scene to run on your home gaming rig in the near-term.\nBut Libreri adds that the tech requirements have been lessened considerably by a de-noising process that dynamically raises or lowers the number of simulated light rays that are necessary for various parts of the scene, based on their importance to the scene in total. Nvidia's Gameworks de-noising code can get things down to as low as two rays per pixel (from a maximum of six), severely lowering the GPU overhead necessary for doing these complex lighting calculations in real time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in a hybrid place for a few years where part is rasterized, part is raytraced,\u201d Libreri said. \u201cThe film business was based on rasterization for two decades [and] finally started making the move to raytracing a decade ago.\"\nHe added, \"It\u2019s just a matter of time\" before raytracing is the standard in games, too.\nIn the meantime, though, we can enjoy this glimpse of just how realistic PC games could look in the future.\nI'm sorry, as much as I'd like to geek out about the tech, the best thing about that clip is the elevator muzak!"}

According to Facebook, it had deleted the two accounts, which had approximately 4 million followers, after the Trump administration had placed Kadyrov on a financial sanctions list.\nThe move against Kadyrov sets the precedent that allows the US government to silence the social media accounts of any foreign politician or official who may voice opposition to US interests by placing them on a sanctions list.\nAlong the same lines as the US and Israeli government\u2019s censorship campaigns, the German government adopted a new law in October that bans \u201chate speech\u201d and other \u201cillegal\u201d content on social media outlets by threatening the companies with a possible $56 million fine if they do not quickly remove offending posts.\nCoinciding with the new law, Facebook opened a \u201cdeletion center\u201d in Essen, Germany employing 500 censors to sort through posts and delete comments, videos and photos that violate the company\u2019s rules. The first such deletion center in Germany was opened in Berlin and now employs 700 people.\nRichard Allan, Facebook\u2019s European Vice President for Public Policy, reported last year that 15,000 posts had been deleted in a single month for violating Germany\u2019s hate speech laws.\nIn what was reported to be the first use of the new social media hate speech ban, Beatrix von Storch, the deputy parliamentary leader for the right-wing extremists Alternative for Germany, had her Twitter and Facebook pages blocked after she posted a racist comment disparaging Muslim man. The offending post was promptly deleted by the social media companies\u2019 censors.\nWhile Facebook\u2019s campaign is justified publicly by targeting right-wing extremists and autocrats, the real aim is to use these powers against anyone who is branded an \u201cextremist,\u201d in particular political opponents of the financial oligarchy. Facebook\u2019s censorship campaign, carried out in coordination with Western governments, is of a piece with Google\u2019s efforts to block access to left-wing and antiwar web sites by demoting their pages in search results, resulting in traffic drops by as much as 75 percent."}

Within minutes -- or even less in some cases -- the 128 GB Surface Pros were sold out at Microsoft brick-and-mortar stores, Microsoft's online store, Best Buy and Staples. In some cases, 64 GB models sold out, as well.\nBut during a Twitter chat on February 12, Panos Panay, the head of the Surface team, provided a few more details about availability.\n\"We are shipping more 64gb now to BBY, Staples, MS Store and online. 128gb at BBY, MS Stores by Saturday.\"\nA number of participants on the chat asked Panay and team why there were seemingly so few Surface Pros available. None of the Microsoft officials on the chat responded to any of those questions -- or to questions about availability of Surface Pro in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. Microsoft execs have said previously that they'd have more to say about broader Surface Pro availability in the coming weeks.\nIt's interesting Panay didn't say Staples would be getting more 128 GB Surface Pros. I've been hearing scuttlebutt that Staples might have intentionally decided against ordering many Surface Pros because of soft demand for Surface RTs. I asked Microsoft and Staples both for comment on this. A Microsoft spokesperson referred me to the \"demand for Surface Pro is so great\" statement again. A Staples spokesperson said: \"We don\u2019t publicly discuss internal plans.\"\nThe Surface Pro 128 GB page doesn't mention any possibility at all of store availability -- beyond the option of paying to have devices shipped to stores -- while the 64 GB version does.\nUpdate (February 13): One contact of mine has a different theory about why Staples isn't getting any of the 128 GB Surface Pros. He said he's heard Staples never carries the high-end model of any PCs or tablets. I have no idea whether this is true.\nMany potential Surface Pro customers were frustrated because Microsoft decided against taking pre-orders for the devices, leading them to assume there'd be sufficient supply when they went to physical stores in the U.S. and Canada to get them. I've heard from a number of readers that retail employees at Microsoft Stores, Best Buys and Staples seemingly had no idea how many Surface Pros they had in stock and/or when they'd get more .\nI've heard in the past couple of days that some Surface Pro purchasers have been able to reserve Surface Pro devices, but only by paying $50 for a Best Buy gift card.\nThe Surface Pro is the second member of the Microsoft Surface PC/tablet family. It is based on an Intel Core i5 processor and gets between four to five hours of battery life, on average. Pricing starts at $899 for the 64 GB model.

Partly that\u2019s because the Globe long ago established a pattern of endorsing Kerry while simultaneously portraying him unsympathetically. Partly it\u2019s because Chatterbox thinks it\u2019s logical for a presumptive presidential nominee to receive better press after he sews the nomination up but before the general election goes into high gear. Mostly, though, it\u2019s because the Globe itself insists on churning up additional evidence of its distaste.\nThe latest evidence is the preface by Globe editor Martin Baron to John Kerry: The Complete Biography by the Boston Globe Reporters Who Know Him Best. (The authors of the book itself, which Chatterbox has not yet read, are Michael Kranish, Brian C. Mooney, and Nina J. Easton.) Ostensibly, the purpose of Baron\u2019s introductory essay is to persuade readers that the Globe\u2019s Kerry coverage has been unmarred by hostility. In practice, however, Baron\u2019s preface demonstrates Kerry\u2019s unique ability to get under the Globe\u2019s skin.\nBaron concedes that the Globe\u2019s relationship with Kerry \u201chas been marked by rocky moments\u201d and that Kerry has often said, \u201cdirectly or through surrogates\u201d that \u201cthe newspaper was out to get him.\u201d Again, nothing unusual about a politician griping about the coverage he gets in his hometown paper. But Baron never really gets around to answering the accusation, except to note many paragraphs later that the Globe failed to endorse Kerry only once, in the 1984 Senate primary. Rather than disprove the Globe\u2019s hostility to Kerry, this argument merely shows that the hostility is complex and interesting.\nBaron himself serves up evidence, of which Chatterbox was previously unaware, that the Globe dislikes Kerry. He cites a December 2002 New Yorker profile by Joe Klein that quotes Martin Nolan, a retired former editorial-page editor at the Globe, saying, \u201cWe were pretty rough on him over the years.\u201d (In January, Nolan told Chatterbox that he\u2019d gotten to like Kerry much better than he used to and never described the Globe\u2019s former attitude quite so bluntly.) Baron also passes along what former Globe editor Michael Janeway told Klein he\u2019d said to Kerry about the rough coverage the Globe gave him during that 1984 Senate primary: \u201cJohn, there are workhorses and show horses, and I guess our staff considers you a show horse.\u201d Ouch!\nThe Globe has too many columnists, therefore too many snarky opinions.\nThe Globe wants the world to know that it is no longer the provincial newspaper of yore, as lampooned in the old joke about the Globe headlining the nuclear annihilation of New York, \u201cHub Man Killed in Atom Blast.\u201d The Globe lacks the option of ignoring Kerry, but second-best might be to hold him in contempt.\nIt would be remiss for Chatterbox not to point out that it remains difficult to find anyone in Massachusetts (well, anyone besides Teddy Kennedy) who professes to like Kerry, even though Kerry keeps getting himself elected senator there, and even though Kerry won the New Hampshire and Massachusetts primaries.

New rules are also needed to battle financial fraud because the current framework is outdated in areas like virtual currency and online payment, he said.\nAs part of the so-called European Agenda on Security, the Commission also plans to launch a forum with major IT companies this year to develop tools to tackle terrorist propaganda on the Internet.\nThe Commission proposed such a forum last year, and in October brought together EU national Interior ministers and senior representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. However, the Commission seeks a dialogue with a wider range of companies, said a Commission official, adding that participants will determine the topics and measures to be discussed.\nThis group will also explore ways to address the concerns of law enforcement authorities on new encryption technologies, the Commission said. EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove in January called on the Commission to force Internet and telecommunications companies to share encryption keys with police and intelligence agencies to help fight terrorism.\nMore cooperation between EU law enforcement agencies is also needed, said Timmermans, who called for more data sharing among these agencies. The priority is to identify and overcome obstacles to criminal investigations, such as access to Internet-based evidence and information.\nEuropol will also be reformed and given responsibility for creating a European counterterrorist center to support national authorities\u2019 efforts against terrorists, terrorist financing, extremist online content and illicit trafficking of firearms, the Commission said.\nAt the same time, already proposed reforms including new data protection rules should be dealt with quickly, Timmermans said. He also called for a swift introduction of a controversial plan to retain and share passenger flight data across the EU. The Passenger Name Record (PNR) system would help prevent, detect, probe and prosecute terrorist offenses and serious transnational crime, according to the Commission.\nHowever, the plan for such a database could face resistance from several members of the European Parliament. Jan Philipp Albrecht, vice chairman of the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Civil Liberties, said in a statement that the mass surveillance of airline passengers will not make people safer.\nOn the contrary, collecting more data may lead to a situation where law enforcement struggles to find the proverbial needle in the haystack, causing them to find hazards too late, Albrecht said.\nThe Commission asked the EU\u2019s other two law-making bodies, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, to endorse the plans in order to renew the EU\u2019s Internal Security Strategy, which sets out the challenges, principles and guidelines for dealing with security threats. The strategy should be the basis for cooperation and joint action on security for the next five years, it said."}

It set off a scramble to track down hundreds of horses in 19 states in order to test, and potentially euthanize, ill animals.\nRisk to additional horses in the second case is low, officials said.\n\"The remaining horses on the facility will be observed, tested and then retested in 60 days,\" Roehr said. \"It is important to note that the risk of disease transmission to other horses in Colorado at this time is low, due to the fact that there are not any horses housed on adjacent properties, which also lowers the risk of biting horse flies in the area.\"\nThe second horse to test positive has been traced to another Weld County herd. There are also concerns about a connection to a horse herd in Texas, Roehr said. Equine health officials are looking at both groups as part of an ongoing investigation.\nThe EIA illness is most commonly spread through blood by biting flies, such as horse flies and deer flies. Officials stress it's important for horse owners to use fly control methods to reduce the chance of EIA and other equine viruses.\nThere's no cure for EIA. Infected horses must be euthanized or quarantined.

He is described as the \"jewel in the crown\".\n\"No pressure, then,\" Faulds says, laughing. He is one of the competitors defending a title after winning gold in Sydney, in his case in the double trap class. He is 27 and has been shooting since he was 10 but still he could do with a little more recognition.\nConsider his role in the BBC's A Question Of Sport, for instance. He is the only one of the 11 British gold medallists from Sydney not to have been invited to appear on the programme.\nFaulds cannot understand why that shoud be. \"Other Olympic champions have been on, some of them more than once, but I have never been asked,\" he says. \"You see the accolades for the England rugby team - and it is great that they're world champions now - but we've been doing that in shooting for the past decade or more.\"\nFaulds, a former world record holder and Britain's first Olympic shooting champion since Malcolm Cooper in 1988, hardly needs to prove himself but accepts that challengers are coming up fast and that shooting can no longer be viewed as a safe haven for the middle-aged competitor.\n\"It is my third Olympics and there are still a lot of people who were in Atlanta who are still there,\" says Faulds. \"But it is becoming a younger man's sport and there are not many people who are competing at the top level who are over 40.\n\"Perhaps 15 years ago the majority of the people were 40-plus. But now more youngsters are becoming better at it at an early age and having more success. We run a junior scholarship scheme in this country for men and ladies which has been successful.\"\nFaulds has fashioned a career out of his sport and lives on his national lottery funding and his sponsorship deals but he came to it in the old-fashioned amateur way - via his parents, who ran a stud farm for racehorses in Sussex.\n\"I don't think I was destined to be where I am,\" says Faulds, who now lives in Andover. \"My dad had shot all his life but not at this level. He has not shot clays competitively but more for the enjoyment side.\n\"It was something I wanted to have a go at as a kid. I was hooked on it straight away. I was quite good from an early age and I just wanted to do more.\n\"It was fantastic the first time I used the gun. Everyone else was kicking a football around and I was off shooting and I actually had quite a lot of time off from school to compete overseas.

As in trap, the clay targets in double trap come from belowthe shooter's feet, 16 metres in front of him or her, but unlike in trap there are two of them - launched together from one of three machines, so angle and direction are unknown.\nWhile most of the athletes going to Athens are concerned about the heat, the shooters expect problems with the wind in their mountain-top venue.\nHe says: \"A breeze bounces a target around and, if you shoot"}

A new realm of power - regulation - demands shared authority and is the EU's greatest achievement. Britain helped create it and can't leave it.\nLeviathan T-shirt thanks to Red Bubble T-Shirts.\nRegulation, reinforced by human rights, has become a new sphere of government. It is now as essential to modern society as executive power, legislative authority and courts of law. The way we experience this is also novel. It does not stem from the influence of politicians, the role of authority whether national or local, or fear of justice. These familiar locations of power continue, but a new force has joined them as our intimate lives have become strangely politicised, from our health and diet to our metadata. The famous frontispiece of Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan shows the people inhabiting the ruler. Today, rules have entered the bodies of citizens - and we want to know who is in charge of them and whether they enhance or imprison us.\nBrexit forces into the open this change, which has been underway since the 1970s. In the UK, those who support Leave have failed to understand the epochal significance of its development, while those who back Remain have failed to articulate it. The European Commission, too, does not grasp its centrality. Brussels as well as Brexiteers are captives of 20th century notions of sovereignty and its unsustainable illusions of grandeur - illusions that are now being tested to their destruction, most immediately with Brexit.\nI stumbled across its significance of regulation and am only beginning to get a measure of it. Denunciation of the EU\u2019s over-regulation was the starting point of the long campaign against British membership. Now, a revealing analysis in openDemocracy reports staggeringly high rates of popular support in the UK for European levels of regulation. They run at between 70-80% - incorporating large majorities of those who voted to Leave. While the big boys bang on about sovereignty, regular people, women somewhat more than men, prefer regulation. Brexit has a weird, old-fashioned veneer because it is so male-dominated and self-important, giving the issue its end of epoch feel. The campaign against it risks being drawn into similar routines and perhaps recognising the centrality of regulation can help prevent this.\nThe significance of regulation came home to me when I recently attended a meeting with a senior member of the Cabinet who is an influential Brexiteer. The UK government will leave the EU, he said confidently, and no longer submit to the ECJ, the European Court of Justice. However, it would seek 'association agreements' with respect to nuclear materials, air travel, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and chemicals. Such agreements would have ECJ oversight. All international agreements necessitated arbitration, he told us, helpfully. The rules would be accepted at every point in the production process. When someone said such ongoing arrangements would come at a high cost, he nodded assent. In effect, the Brexiteer told us, all our manufacturing needs to be within the aegis of the EU\u2019s regulated space.\nShortly after Open Europe, which is directed by Brexit-supporting Henry Newman who once worked for Michael Gove, published Striking a Balance, a report that recommends an across-the-board agreement on these lines.

Those who are not enrolled by the end of today may not be able to obtain coverage until 2015, as the next open enrollment period will not be until November.\nIn a briefing Monday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stressed that HealthCare.gov has seen a \"significant surge\" in signups over the past few weeks.\nThis is, of course, not the first problem for HealthCare.gov.

The trends in the collisions are disturbing as well: In 1990, the industry saw 1,738 bird strikes; in 2007, the number had increased to 7,666. Some of that trend is due to increased air travel, but the number of wildlife strikes has tripled from 0.527 to 1.751 per 10,000 flights.\nThose numbers were brought into terrifyingly sharp relief when the US Airways jet appeared to have hit a flock of birds, causing malfunctions which necessitated a splash landing.\n\"We\u2019ve all known that it was just a matter of time. You can quantify it,\" said Barthell Joseph, a co-founder of Joseph Reed, which sells bird-deterrence technologies. \"You can take the number of bird strikes and you can take the trend of bird strikes and you can take the number of commercial flights and it\u2019s fairly simple to do the math.\"\nGrowing populations of birds and humans in the same areas have put the species on a collision course in the air that\u2019s almost always deadly for the birds and severely hazardous, if not fatal, to humans, too. Human developments and bird-restoration programs have created new ecological niches that some bird species have jumped in to fill.\nIn particular, the Canada goose population is proving particularly problematic. Their numbers have ballooned to more than 3.5 million, and the birds don\u2019t migrate, they stick around our cities. Many of the geese along the eastern seaboard are closer to feral than wild. After their forebears were nearly hunted to extinction, many domesticated birds were released into the wild (pdf), creating a specific population of geese uniquely suited to the \"current landscaping techniques\" of our urban and suburban landscapes. In the map at the right, you can see that most of the country is seeing large annual increases goose populations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Report (linked above) found that the population of Canada geese in the eastern United States increased at a rate of 14 percent a year from 1989 through 2004.\nThe rising bird numbers are overwhelming the efforts of airport operations managers to cope with the problem, despite increasingly sophisticated technology to scare the birds away. Joseph also said that the Federal Aviation Administration wasn\u2019t taking the bird strike problem seriously.\nA small group of individuals at airports and other organizations, like the U.S. Navy, are studying the situation on their own through the Bird Strike Committee, a group dedicated to \"understanding and reducing bird and other wildlife hazards to aircraft.\"\n\"Strikes are happening daily but you\u2019re not seeing major damaging strikes, which are causing loss of human life or loss of the airplane,\"\nAirport. \"It\u2019s out there, every single day.\"\n$200,000 wildlife deterrence budget on a system of remote-controlled propane cannons made by Joseph Reed.\nThe system, called Scare Wars, is composed of remote-"}

But Oddnesse is here to completely change the game, blending lo-fi independence and shape-shifting guitar and piano tones into an intoxicating blur. Her angelic and potent vocal is light as a feathery but carries the weight of the world: the darkness seeps into her lyrics with brawn and delicacy. Her stories engulf your senses, particularly on such standout tracks on her new EP as \"Scream\" (featuring a spine-tingling guitar bridge) and \"Somewhere Somehow,\" decorated with a dirtier, flesh-cutting Hinds feel.\nThen, on \"Incoming Call,\" she channels the sensuality and grit of Alanis Morissette--circa Jagged Little Pill--with a more breezy bite. \"Swim to the Shore,\" meanwhile, sits in the front of brain; \"oh, come on, it can't be that far, listen to the trees, look up at the stars, oh, come on, it can't be so deep. If you're afraid, I'll let you hang onto me,\" she maintains. All four songs have all been stealthily trickled out in the past several weeks, now culminating into a cohesive and provocative set.

But yes, Apple is planning to release an even better iPad in just a few months - gosh, shock horror, who could've guessed it?\nLatest rumours suggest that a new, improved iPad - commonly dubbed iPad 5 - is going to be announced in March, which isn't that surprising, to be frank. The \"new\" iPad - or iPad 3 - was announced in March this year, and the iPad 2, March 2011.\nThe original iPad was first announced in January 2010, but pre-orders didn't begin until March that year. Of course, the fourth-generation iPad was unveiled at the same time as the iPad mini in October, but that was more because the company wanted to add support for 4G in the UK as the EE network had just gone live.\nSo, a \"leak\" suggesting that the next model will be announced in March is like whispering to someone conspiratorially that it is going to rain tomorrow after taking a glimpse at a weather report.\nMore interesting, perhaps, is that the Japanese website Macotakara also reports that its \"informed sources\" say that the iPad 5 will be lighter and thinner, drawing inspiration from the design of the iPad mini. And this does accord with a previous rumour that the next Apple tablet will ditch one of the two LED backlighting bars in order to reduce weight.\nTranslation is sometimes tricky in such cases, but we think that when Macotakara claims that the new iPad will be \"a small 4mm in height, 17mm in width, depth 2mm\" it means that it will be smaller than the former model by those dimensions. For example, the current fourth-generation device is 9.4mm thick. Take away the 2mm quoted and that'll leave 7.4mm. The iPad mini is 7.2mm, so that makes sense.\nIf this is true, is also means that the bezel on the iPad 5 will be smaller, as the screen will be the same 9.7-inches. That'd be nice.\nWhatever the reality of the situation, you can be sure of one thing: this will not be the last we hear of the iPad 5 before its launch. Oh no, siree."}

At different points in time, the perfect diet has been popularized as everything from The Grapefruit Diet of the 30s to Oprah\u2019s famous liquids-only diet.\nHere\u2019s the thing: there\u2019s no perfect diet that will work for every single person on this planet. Every body is different. So, rather than clawing desperately for a one-ticket solution to your dietary needs, here are a few principles that can help you decide what\u2019s right for you.\nMove away from a dated \u201cfood group philosophy\u201d into one that values nutrients, mainly: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Work on hitting the recommended daily intake (RDI) of all your most important nutrients, then work with a dietitian to make adjustments as necessary based on your personal body chemistry.\nFoods are most nutrient-dense when they\u2019re fresh, in season and locally grown, so choose fresh foods as often as possible. Spend most of your time shopping the outside perimeters of your grocery store and avoid the center aisles as these are typically filled with processed, nutrient-poor foods.\nEat the highest-quality food that you can afford without breaking the bank. If you can swing it, it\u2019s prudent to put a higher proportion of your income into better, higher quality food, as this will help you maintain a healthful life for years to come.\nPutting your body on a blood sugar roller coaster is one of the worst things you can do for your long-term health. To prevent insulin spikes and slow the release of sugar, eat carbohydrates in moderation and in balance with protein and fat sources.\nA diet that strictly cuts out treats like cookies and crackers just isn\u2019t realistic. That said, diets high in processed foods often lead to a number of serious health risks, so choose these in extreme moderation and opt for \u201creal food\u201d instead. What counts as real food? Anything that comes naturally from the earth and has not been altered or modified.\nEating a wide range of foods is a great way to \u201chedge your bets\u201d when it comes to building a healthful diet. Eating in season will help you do this, as readily available foods will shift month by month. You might also choose to shop at new stores, visit the farmers market or make it a point to try a new recipe once a week.\nThe perfect diet will be one that you can sustain for a long time. It should not be socially isolating \u2013 meaning, you should not feel cut off or high maintenance when out with friends \u2013 and it should suit your lifestyle overall. It should also be sustainable beyond your lifetime. Consider how the food you eat fits into the greater food ecosystem. Will your choice have a positive impact? Or will it deplete the earth\u2019s resources?\nRemember: A healthy diet for one person may not be a healthy diet for another. There is no cookie cutter solution here. But apply these guidelines and you\u2019ll be well on your way to a healthier, happier life."}

While the breeze can be frustratingly variable on land, if you travel just 20 miles off the coastline, the wind blows at a consistent clip of around 33 feet per second.\nBut along most parts of the coastal United States, the ocean floor drops off quickly. That makes standard offshore turbines, the kind that are fixed to the sea bottom for stability, too expensive to be worth it. Two companies, Sway and Principle Power, are currently testing a new kind of technology to combat this problem: floating wind turbines.\nPrinciple's turbine is called WindFloat; the company has a prototype currently working in the waters off Portugal. It sits atop a base formed by three pontoons anchored to the seafloor by cables. Its 240-ton nacelle (gear housing) turns to meet the breeze, the way a land-based turbine does.\nSway's prototype, operating in Norway, is more of a small tower. Its center of gravity lies below the structure's center of buoyancy, which lets it stay upright even in stormy seas. With Sway, the entire tower rotates to get in the best position to capture wind.\nThough these prototypes are currently in Europe, the United States is keeping a close eye. The Department of Energy, which estimates that wind power could cover 20 percent of our energy needs by 2030, has contributed funding to both systems. The hope is that offshore wind power can alleviate some of the problems hampering that energy source in America now.\nFor instance, traditional wind farms are on land, many located in the Plains states. Although they can generate a substantial amount of power, the problem is transporting that power to the big cities that need it most, many of which are located hundreds of miles away in coastal areas.\nBy contrast, regular \"fixed bottom\" off-shore wind turbines are built close to the coast, within easy transport distance to large, power-guzzling cities. But they too have their cons, says Fort Felker, director of the National Wind Technology Center. For one, most residents of coastal towns simply don't want their ocean views interrupted by wind turbines. Another is that anchoring these wind turbines to the ocean floor is expensive and difficult, and the noise can disrupt marine animals. Two hundred feet is considered the maximum depth for fixed-bottom turbines, and two-thirds of the U.S. coastal ocean is deeper than this limit, Felker says.\nDeep-sea offshore wind turbines have the potential to solve many of these problems. Their floating construction is ideal for the deep coastal waters of the U.S. And since they don't have to be fixed to the ocean floor, they can be assembled conveniently on dry land before they're launched (and it's possible that they can be pulled back in for repairs as well). Because the towers are far off-shore, they won't offend coastal residents, and they're perfectly positioned to take advantage of the open ocean's strong and steady winds.\nThe key to making floating wind turbines work is a design that collects enough energy to justify the cost of building and installing them. Luckily, experts say, the technology already has a head start: Offshore oil and gas drilling companies have long dealt with the engineering challenges of floating designs. \"The challenge for the wind industry is to adapt these technologies and extract costs so that we end up with an efficient, renewable energy system,\" Felker says.\nWindFloat's base adjusts the water level in three columns to keep the turbine level.

His allies saw the detention as an attempt by Mr. Maduro to weaken the opposition before legislative elections later that year.\nIn Madrid on Saturday, he was greeted by the former president of Colombia, Andr\u00e9s Pastrana, and the former Venezuelan ambassador, Fernando Gerbasi.\nMr. Ledezma said his decision to flee was driven by threats intended to force the opposition to resume negotiations with Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. A fellow opposition leader, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, remains under house arrest in Venezuela.\nMr. Maduro\u2019s jailing of his opponents has been widely criticized by foreign governments and democracy advocates worldwide. On Monday, the foreign ministers of the European Union demanded \u201cthe liberation of all political prisoners\u201d in Venezuela. And the Trump administration cited it in imposing sanctions this year against Mr. Maduro and dozens of officials in his government.\nOver the summer, after sidelining the Venezuela legislature by putting in place a new body known as the Constituent Assembly, Mr. Maduro\u2019s government began releasing some political opponents from custody.\nOn Friday, after slipping past intelligence officers stationed outside his residence, Mr. Ledezma passed through several police checkpoints in a long journey by car to Colombia, where officials have been at odds with the Maduro government.\nColombian immigration authorities said Mr. Ledezma had entered the country legally after crossing the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Bridge, which connects the Venezuelan city of San Antonio del T\u00e1chira with the Colombian town of Villa Rosario.\nMr. Ledezma thanked both Spanish and Colombian authorities for what he described as their warm welcome."}

Both figures were above Wall Street expectations of $US14.63 billion revenue and $US0.30 earnings per share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.\nHowever, Dell warned investors to be cautious when comparing the figures to past quarters because the company plans to restate its earnings for the past four years. Dell plans to revise its quarterly and annual financial statements for fiscal 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.\nThe company also plans to share a number of earnings reports it delayed filing during its internal investigation of the accounting fraud, including the last three quarters of fiscal 2007 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Nasdaq stock market has given Dell a deadline of November 12 to file those reports in order to meet requirements for a publicly traded stock. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to continue its own investigation of Dell's bookkeeping practices.\nDell's accounting problems were more than a mere distraction, costing the company $US59 million to pay for its internal audit over the past quarter. Also detracting from its profit was $US102 million in stock option payments, the company said.\nDespite its troubles, Dell is making progress on a long-term plan to reduce its operating expenses, CEO, Michael Dell, said in a statement. The company will do that through layoffs, improved productivity and investments in its infrastructure. In May, Dell announced it would lay off 8800 people, about 10 per cent of its workforce. Over the past quarter, the company has made a series of acquisitions, including ASAP Software, SilverBack Technologies Inc. and Zing Systems Inc.\nIn recent months, Dell has also made a major change in its business plan by augmenting its online direct-sales model with deals to sell its PCs through retail partners such as Wal-Mart Stores in North America and South America, Bic Camera in Japan and Carphone Warehouse in the UK."}

{"idx": "19104", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Or not. In the world of digital photography, you don't have to flash a smile. Instead, just digitally paint a grin on your face afterward.\nStruggling for hours to get just the right shot under the optimum lighting conditions is so analog. Today, digital photography allows any wannabe Ansel Adams to create a photographic masterpiece in homage to the 20th century landscape marvel. And with a good smartphone camera and the right camera app, the tools are in everyone's hands.\nIn the past couple of years, editing apps that create different styles of pictures have become much more sophisticated and robust. Here are some of the ones we like, along with ones readers have suggested (sorry, but none are yet available for Windows Phone).\nWhether you want your portrait to look like a faded, scratched driver's license photo or a romantic postcard, Snapseed has it all.\nThere are 14 different styles and tools, anything from automatic color correction to a feature that creates a faded, grainy film look. Also made easy is adjustment of standard photo toning qualities such as brightness, saturation and white balance. The interface lets the user slide a finger up or down in an easy-to-use set of controls, creating the ability to take a picture and change it on the fly or import one into the app to change later. A downside is that Google+ is the only social network you can upload the picture to directly.\nThis is as full-featured of a camera app as you can find. There are scores of effects available, from a pastel-styled portrait to simulated paper. It also can add distortion effects such as pixelating a facial image or creating a focal zoom. You also can produce albums with different layouts.\nOnce the photo is done, the image posts it to a variety of social networks. There also is a section where users share their photos. The main menu is beautifully designed and similar to the colored tiles in Windows 8 (although, again, there is no Windows Phone version of PicsArt). A downside is that there is a bit of a wait every time you add changes to a picture.\nThis app goes way beyond photo toning and allows you to turn pictures into stunning artwork -- sketches, watercolors, colored pencil, comic books and more. You can preview the different effects -- 13 in all -- in real time, which makes it easy to see what your final photo might look like. However, there is a slight delay between hitting the shutter button and the image actually being captured. The result is a slightly different shot than you were expecting.\nFor that reason, the best way to use Paper Camera is to take a regular photo, then open that in the app so you can dial in the effects for the perfect picture. Each effect has six different components --contrast, brightness, lines, edges and two effect-specific options. Each effect is controlled by an easy-to-use slider, and there's a reset button that brings the effect back to the default setting. Plus, this is a great app for entertaining kids.\nOne advanced option on an SLR camera that you rarely find in a phone camera is the ability to do a long exposure. Phone cameras are typically a one-quick-shot wonder with little in the way of professional settings. Camera FV-5 adds some of those functions to your arsenal. It allows you to set up for an \"open shutter\" long exposure, choose from several light metering modes and change the ISO setting manually.\nIf you've ever taken a photo with both bright and dark parts in the image, and wished your camera didn't have to adjust to one or the other, this app is for you.

Jurors did spare Socrates from the death penalty, but that's probably cold comfort to the philosopher, who performed his own execution by drinking hemlock juice after the first trial.\nThe fake Socrates was fined 3,000 silver drachmas, and his request of free meals for life was denied.\nFitzgerald offered a passionate argument for convicting Socrates, but he stopped short of saying the philosopher's crime spree would make Pythagoras roll over in his grave. He also hinted before the proceedings that Socrates refused a plea deal, which would have spared the non-existent taxpayers of fake Athens the expense of a second trial.\n\"Make no mistake about it. Socrates is guilty. I know what you're thinking: 'Fitzgerald has lost his mind,'\" the former federal prosecutor said, acknowledging that historians have acquitted Socrates of his crimes. \"History got it wrong. History has been unfair to my client, Athens.\"\nPlaying the straight man, Fitzgerald blamed Socrates protege Plato for distorting the modern view of the case. Plato's account of the trial serves as the primary record of the proceedings, prompting prosecutors to question its reliability.\n\"Think about Plato. How much clout did he have with historians that he could pull this off? He only quoted his friend,\" Fitzgerald said, as the sold-out crowd roared with laughter.\nAt the time of his original trial, Socrates was considered a gadfly by society in Athens and not particularly well-liked around town. His interminable and circular discussions -- now known as the Socratic Method -- made him somewhat insufferable, and his public attacks against Greek gods made him blasphemous in many citizens' eyes.\nPlus, he was a Sparta superfan, an annoyance akin to a Chicago-born Packers fan who always brags about Green Bay's record.\nU.S. Appellate Judge Richard Posner presided over the mock trial, along with U.S. Appellate Judge William J.

Posner insisted that the attorneys follow Athenian law when making their arguments.\nFitzgerald was joined by former assistant U.S. attorney Patrick Collins, who led the prosecution against former Gov.

So Anthem has taken the obvious next step: This year, it\u2019s rolling out the policy in three additional states. Prior to Jan. 1, the policy was in effect in Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. This year, it\u2019s adding New Hampshire, Indiana and Ohio. More states may follow.\nMedical experts say the policy places an insupportable responsibility on ordinary customers to diagnose themselves before turning to the ER for treatment.\nSome are also concerned that patients who have experienced claim rejections in the past might be discouraged from returning to the ER for a recurrent condition or a new one, a decision that could have life-threatening implications.\n\u201cPatients are not physicians,\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) lectured Anthem CEO Joseph R. Swedish in a Dec. 20 letter seeking documentation of how the company arrived at its policy and how it is being applied. \u201cAnthem\u2019s policies are discouraging individuals from receiving needed care and treatment out of fear they may personally be fully financially responsible,\u201d McCaskill wrote, \u201ceven though they have insurance.\u201d McCaskill asked for the material to be submitted by Jan. 19.\nAnthem refused to say how it has responded to the letter, and McCaskill\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether the company met the deadline.\nA spokeswoman for Anthem\u2019s Georgia program told me last year that the policy wouldn't apply when the patient is 14 or younger, an urgent care clinic isn't located within 15 miles, or the visit occurs on a Sunday or holiday. She said it's aimed at manifestly minor ailments \u2014 \"If you had cold symptoms; if you have a sore throat,\u201d she said. \u201cSymptoms of potentially more serious conditions, such as chest pains, could be seen at the ER even if they turn out to be indigestion.\"\nBut that doesn\u2019t fit well with a policy that threatens patients with a big bill if they guess wrong. And many patients may not be aware of the exemptions for weekend visits, for younger patients, or for those not located near an urgent care clinic. They could be discouraged from visiting the ER, too.\nWhat\u2019s especially unclear is how Anthem\u2019s policy is supposed to correspond to two important legal safeguards for patients. One is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986. EMTALA, as the act is known, requires emergency departments to screen, stabilize or treat anyone showing up at the ER, regardless of their ability to pay.\nEMTALA was designed as an anti-dumping law to prevent for-profit hospitals from fobbing off indigent patients to public hospitals without treating them first. The rule imposes costs for care on hospitals that treat uninsured patients; hospitals justifiably are concerned that Anthem\u2019s policy could impose costs for insured patients, too.\nThe second safeguard is the \u201cprudent layperson\u201d rule, which requires insurers to cover ER visits made by a member who resorts to the ER for a condition that the average person would consider a possible emergency.\nAnthem told me in an emailed statement that a company medical director will review suspect ER claims by applying the prudent layperson standard to \u201cclaim information and"}

Compared to 2008, shootings are down 35 percent.\nDelaware's largest city desperately needed this improvement. Shootings and killings have steadily grown more frequent, and 2017 was Wilmington's worst-ever year of gun violence. Last year, an analysis by The News Journal and the Associated Press found youth were more likely to be shot in Wilmington than in any other city in America.\nPolice Chief Robert Tracy has made clear that police are \"nowhere near to declaring victory,\" and city officials were careful to say they were \"cautiously optimistic.\" That is appropriate.\nShootings spike during the summer, and winter lingered long over Delaware. More than half the year is left. But we are hopeful that this is the beginning of a sustained downward trend in crime rates.\nWhat caused the decline in violence? It's impossible to say for sure.\nTracy has pushed the department towards a community policing model that residents have long called for, urging his officers to get out of their squad cars and interact more directly with the public. Some community members say that has increased trust and willingness to cooperate with police, while police say they are able to more proactively stop crimes before they happen.\nTracy also brought a data-driven framework called CompStat to Wilmington, which he credits for more efficient and effective policing.\nIt's possible sweeping arrests of alleged Wilmington gang members last year may have helped. Community members have long said the violence can be traced back to a small number of violent people.\nWhatever is working, it's important to note that law enforcement alone cannot fix Wilmington's crime problem.\nDespite waves of education reform and the often heroic efforts of teachers and principals, Wilmington schools continue to have shockingly low test scores, disturbingly frequent staff turnover and generally unacceptable outcomes. Likewise, jobs for those in Wilmington's roughest neighborhoods are far too hard to come by, particularly for those trying to turn over a new leaf after an arrest.\nMost of these problems are beyond the scope of city leaders' authority. State officials should seize on this momentum to tackle the root social and economic drivers of crime.\nFor once, the crime news out of Wilmington is good.

Along with fat and protein, carbohydrates are an essential nutrient. The two major forms of carbs are_ simple sugars (simple carbohydrates), found in sugars such as fructose, glucose, and lactose, as well as in nutritious whole fruits; and starches (complex carbohydrates), found in foods such as starchy vegetables, grains, rice, and bread and cereals.\nWhat makes carbs different from other essential nutrients (fat and protein) is that they are easily converted to energy by the body. Furthermore, the simplest carbohydrate, glucose, is essential fuel for the brain and muscles. When glucose is absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream, blood-glucose levels increase, and your pancreas begins to secrete insulin to help get that sugar out of the blood and to the brain and muscles. The problem occurs when too much glucose over-whelms the metabolism. In other words, if you regularly eat great amounts of foods with refined starches and sugars-the bad carbs-the pancreas makes too much insulin and the blood sugar drops too far, which, in turn, makes you feel hungry. Furthermore, muscle cells will stop taking in the glucose, and so more of this sugar will be stored as fat, which will result in weight gain.\nGOOD CARB FOODS:Complex carbohydrates are the good carbs. Among good carbs are high-fiber, low-sugar fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole oatmeal and all other whole grains, and all types of beans (a Latin staple!). Sweet potatoes, brown rice, grapefruit, fat-free milk (organic and in moderation, please), whole grain pasta (also in moderation), and apples, like other good carbs, cause a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels, which is optimal for sustained energy, mental clarity and focus, and a balanced mood.

The company also has now provided a knowledgebase article that explains how to use the fixit program to disable the graphical representation of icons displayed on the Windows Task Bar and Start Menu, which effectively will plug the flaw.\nIn the meantime, however, the software firm is urging more collegial interactions between software vendors and security researchers, after a group of hackers started an anonymous website, launched in early July, to publish more zero-day exploits in protest of what they view as Microsoft's heavy-handed response to the public disclosures of flaws in Microsoft software.\nMicrosoft has always called for what it considers \"responsible disclosure,\" but others in the developer community and elsewhere have pushed for more aggressive \"full disclosure,\" essentially the idea that any information about a security flaw should be released as soon as it's known.\nNow, Microsoft is trying to tone down the rhetoric and urge more cooperation among all parties, in a philosophical turn it has dubbed \"coordinated vulnerability disclosure,\" according to a post to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog Thursday.\n\"In recognition of the endless debate between responsible disclosure and full disclosure proponents and its ability to detract from meaningful and productive industry collaboration and customer defense, we believe that the community mindset needs to shift, framing a key point -- that coordination and collaboration are required to resolve issues in a way that minimizes risk and disruption for customers,\" Matt Thomlinson, general manager of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Security, said in the post.\nHackers have repeatedly accused Microsoft over the years of ignoring security flaw reports, often for months and sometimes even years. Some hackers have taken it personally enough to publicly disclose security exploits at the same time as they notify Microsoft.\nThat, they say, at least gets Microsoft's attention.\nIn contrast, Microsoft views the public disclosures of such so-called \"zero-day\" exploits -- meaning the exploit has been revealed before there is a patch -- as putting users' PCs at risk, and putting the company under increased pressure to rush patches out.\nMicrosoft's latest proposal calls for those who find security vulnerabilities to still report them to the affected vendor in advance of public disclosure of the flaw and ways to exploit them. However, the company is proposing slight adjustments to its previous policy -- mostly, it appears, adjustments in attitudes because the proposal is still very similar to Microsoft's earlier responsible disclosure process.\n\"The finder allows the vendor an opportunity to diagnose and offer fully tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before detailed vulnerability or exploit information is shared publicly.

One analyst thinks the number will go much, much higher.\nOne of the biggest draws for some Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shoppers is the company's Prime loyalty program. What began as essentially free two-day shipping now provides a host of benefits including free streaming music and video, e-books, and exclusive savings at Whole Foods. Members are also granted entry to Amazon's annual members-only Prime Day sale and early access to lightning deals -- sales of certain items \"while supplies last.\"\nIt turns out that Prime members spend considerably more than the average shopper, becoming some of Amazon's best customers. One analyst says those valuable Prime subscribers are set to more than double over the next decade, bringing their ranks to 275 million.\nCiti analyst Mark May has done the math, and believes that Amazon Prime subscribers are increasing by some 35% to 40% annually. Amazon doesn't disclose this info, though CEO Jeff Bezos did reveal earlier this year that Prime has topped 100 million members. May estimates that the subscriber base could grow to more than 275 million within the coming 10 years. He also calculated that Amazon will reap more than $500 billion in Prime-related gross sales each year within a decade, and reach total gross sales of $633 billion by 2029.\nAs a result of these estimates, Citi raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $2,250, more than 17% higher than the current level -- and that's on top of the 64% Amazon's stock has gained already this year.\n\"We remain positive on Amazon shares and view Amazon's large and growing global Prime member base as not only a source of recurring revenue but a key reason why brands and third-party sellers are increasingly relying on Amazon's marketplace,\" May wrote. \"There are many benefits of having highly satisfied membership-based customers, but a simple metric is that most studies suggest Prime members spend twice as much as non-Prime members.\"\nMay's estimates regarding Prime customer spending habits may even be conservative. Research by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners suggests that Prime subcribers spend $1,400 per year, on average, compared to just $600 per year for non-member customers. The study also found that \"Prime members with the longest tenure spend more, as customers with memberships longer than three years spend $1,500 per year.\"\nPrime subscribers may make up roughly 80% of households in the U.S. -- the online retailer's most established market -- by 2029. The program has expanded internationally to 16 countries, but May believes it will take time for Prime to achieve significant penetration in those geographies. That said, he expects that international Prime members are likely spending an estimated $35 to $40 per month on Amazon, compared to about $120 per month for subscribers in the U.S.\nThere are lots of reasons to like Amazon, from its growing cadre of Prime members to its thriving business-to-business portal, and from its blooming advertising business to its industry-leading cloud computing service.\nWith all those ways to win, Amazon is still the one stock I'd buy right now."}

Trump and his advisers have vowed to withdraw the United States from climate accords abroad and to abandon President Barack Obama\u2019s push for clean energy at home.\nIf the Trump administration keeps those promises, China will probably step into the leadership vacuum left by the United States.

Some of those interests, such as China\u2019s desire to cultivate foreign markets for clean energy exports and curb domestic air pollution, line up with combatting climate change. Others, such as the incentives the country faces to export coal power plants abroad, could get in the way of reducing emissions.

It's also a predictor of physical health.\nThe costs of this divide are revealing. Of the total annual spend on dental care ($9.9 billion in 2015-16), individuals contributed 58 per cent in out-of-pocket costs.\nLittle wonder that 44 per cent of uninsured Australians and 20 per cent of those with insurance delay or avoid going to the dentist.\nTwenty per cent of those who do go to the dentist are unable to proceed with recommended treatment because of cost.\nThat leads to some shocking statistics: one in four children aged 5-10 years have untreated tooth decay in their primary teeth and one in 25 Australians aged 15 and over have no natural teeth.\nSome 5.7 million Australians are living with at least one dental or oral health issue. About one in five Australians do not get the recommended level of oral health care.\nThe picture is worse for Indigenous Australians, especially in remote communities where sugar-laden processed foods are ubiquitous but dental services are scarce.\nBad teeth and poor oral hygiene are not simply cosmetic problems but the cause of sickness, disability and even death.\nPoor oral health is linked to malnutrition (especially in the elderly), heart infections, coronary heart disease, stroke, poor outcomes in pregnancy, and aspiration pneumonia.\nAcross the nation, there were 67,060 preventable hospitalisations for oral health conditions in 2015-16 (10 per cent of all preventable hospitalisations), at an estimated cost of some $230 million.\nIncreasing tooth decay has seen a surge in general anaesthesia for children needing dental treatment in hospitals.\nYet medicine and dentistry remain distinct practices that have never been treated the same way by the healthcare system, health insurance funds, policymakers and the public.\nThe Whitlam government did not include dental care in Medibank (the precursor to Medicare) because negotiations with doctors' groups consumed all their efforts and because the states and territories already had public dental systems.\nNow the Commonwealth and the states jointly fund public dental services for people on low incomes through National Partnership Agreements. Total expenditure by governments in 2015-16 was $2.4 billion.\nBut while 36 per cent of the population is eligible for public dental services, there is capacity to provide services to only about one-fifth of this group.\nNo wonder there are long waits for public dental services: in 2015-16 the \"best\" average waiting time was 87 days in Western Australia, the worst was 916 days in Tasmania.\nOver the years the Commonwealth has funded a number of dental programs which have come and gone with the governments that proposed them. Today only the Child Dental Benefit Schedule remains.\nAncillary private health insurance (held by 55.7 per cent of the population) provides dental cover, but it's expensive and does not do what insurance is supposed to \u2014 protect against unexpected costs.\nIt generally provides only limited, capped assistance for dental services, which means the majority of adults"}

Historically, advertising and marketing have been, for the most part, disruptive forces. Like when you\u2019re trying to watch a TV show and get interrupted (perhaps ironically) by the commercial break. Such content was not asked for, and is generally not wanted, so it better be damned entertaining if your audience is going to stay on the couch and watch.\nTrying to force your message into the noisy marketplace, especially on a small media budget, has a high risk of failure. To make things even more difficult, modern consumers are hard to pin down; they're constantly in motion -- traversing different spaces, utilizing different media, and as always, experiencing a range of different thoughts and feelings throughout any given day.\nIf you want to move people, you have to become a part of their journey.\nAs we move forward as marketers, our first thought should no longer be about disruption. Instead, we should consider ways that we can leverage the existing momentum of target consumers. By doing so, we can organically guide them where we want them to go -- with minimum waste and maximum efficiency.\nImagine a project manager sitting at her desk, right around noon, listening to Pandora on her mobile. She's starting to get hungry when -- boom: a dual-pronged message comes through from Restaurant X, a national chain (your client). The \u201cradio\u201d message tells her that lunch specials are available today, at a location just down the street. Even better, she can get directions and a coupon right now just by tapping the display ad on her phone.\nOr picture a high-school athlete who is looking online for a competitive edge. He searches \u201cbest running shoes\u201d and comes across a one he\u2019s never heard of before: Sneaker Y (your client\u2019s product). He clicks through to see branded messaging on the shoe, a series of compelling testimonials, and a link to Zappos.com where he can purchase his first pair now and receive an automatic, exclusive, 15-percent discount.\nOr consider a grad student who is in-market for her first new sedan. She\u2019s weighing the pros and cons of several models when she sees a friend\u2019s pin posted on a board called \u201cThings I Love.\u201d It\u2019s an image of the 2013 Sedan Z (your client\u2019s product). The pin links out to a product landing page where she can view specs, see the car in different trims/colors, read Facebook posts from fans, watch a TV spot (via YouTube), etc.\nThis is the next evolution of strategic communications, and it\u2019s called Momentum Marketing. It\u2019s an approach that blends strategy and creative to discover where your best targets are, connect with them in stride, warm them to your brand, and guide their momentum in your direction.\nMomentum Marketing has many facets. But at the simplest level, it\u2019s about challenging your marketing strategy by asking this litmus-test question at each touchpoint: \u201cWould the typical person in my target audience welcome this message?\u201d If the answer isn\u2019t an emphatic yes!, then go back to the drawing board.

Here\u2019s our reaction to the episode which contains some spoilers.\nThe Sign of Three marked a dramatic tonal change for BBC Sherlock \u2013 or rather, a comedic one. This is the funniest episode of the series in existence, the writing team of Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss and Steve Thompson all pitching in to craft a ninety minutes that gave us a look at how Sherlock handles one of the most important social situations in life, with all the surrounding activities that accompany it.\nThe Sign of Three is light, fluffy and fun, but a genuine seriousness creeps in by the final minutes.\nWith John asking Sherlock to be his best man, there\u2019s an obvious potential recipe for disaster. And at first, it certainly seems that may be the way things are going when Sherlock begins his speech, a fluctuating narrative that dips backwards and forwards to various time periods. Everything initially seems totally unfocussed, but it\u2019s actually a remarkably clever and twisting storyline that flits about like the Mayfly Man \u2013 the eventually dominating mystery that forms the spine of the episode.\nIn many ways, this \u2018good old fashioned\u2019 attempted-murder mystery is far stronger than the case that The Empty Hearse was concerned with. In that episode, the entire point of the mystery was to place Sherlock and John together in a situation that would reconcile them \u2013 it served the characters more than the story of the episode.\nHere, there\u2019s still a connection to John thanks to the military targets of the would-be killer, but the case emerges more gradually \u2013 it may feel sidelined on the first watch, but it\u2019s actually there throughout two thirds of the runtime.\nPartly that is thanks to the comedy that runs throughout the episode. While the characters have long existed in the modern world, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen them exist in modern British social life. The Stag Do, an event with so many astonishing moments, is a justified indulgence for the writers, cutting loose and having fun with their versions of the classic characters.\nAs Martin Freeman told us last year, he is playing Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss\u2019 version of the character, not Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s, and many scenes here are the chance to see how these extraordinary characters deal with a realistic social situation. The result, thanks to all our past experiences with them, is uproarious."}

Would that be idolatrous?\nBut here is the problem: Worries about Artificial Intelligence reflect a diminished view of human beings and the human mind.\nIs it just \u201cintelligence\u201d that makes us human? Indeed, a long philosophical tradition stresses that we are \u201crational animals,\u201d that what defines us is our reason.\nBut is it? The mind has many faculties. Reason and intelligence, yes, but also imagination, emotions, the will, and more. The imagination, the power to think in sensory images, itself includes a number of related abilities: memory, revery, the ability to conceive of the future (which we use in planning, daydreaming, worrying), creativity (the ability to conceive of things that do not exist, necessary not only for artistic creation but in virtually any kind of work, including the invention of computers and the capacity to conduct \u201cthought experiments\u201d).\nAnd consciousness is not a function of any of these. Rather, it is the personal identity that looms behind them all, not only experiencing but also activating them all.\nAnd beneath even our present consciousness is our fundamental center of identity: the soul.\nIf a machine attains artificial intelligence, would it have artificial imagination? artificial emotions? an artificial will? an artificial soul?\nSo even though extremely rapid calculation of programmed algorithms might eventually result in"}

In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite, according to some industry executives reacting to last week\u2019s Senate hearing on a proposal to require Nielsen to get Media Rating Council (MRC) accreditation for any new ratings service before going to market. Currently an industry group, the MRC would be given legal authority under the proposal.\n\u201cNielsen has a lot of things to fix, and if the government gets involved, they\u2019re not going to make progress on anything,\u201d said a source at a top-10 media agency.\nKathy Crawford, president, local broadcast, MindShare, testified against the proposed bill. She said Nielsen is not perfect, but the MRC is stacked in favor of broadcasters. Broadcasters are divided on the issue. Some, such as Fox and Tribune, favor government oversight; others, such as CBS, agree that self-regulation is the better remedy.\nDavid Poltrack, evp, research and planning, CBS, said he was heartened last week by Nielsen\u2019s commitment to voluntarily submitting new ratings services to the MRC auditing process before taking them public. \u201cThat\u2019s preferable to government intervention,\u201d he said."}
{"idx": "19147", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On Aug. 6, 1945, the United States dropped a uranium-fueled atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later, another U.S. Army Air Forces B-29 repeated the attack on Nagasaki, Japan, with an even more powerful plutonium bomb.\nLess than a month after the second bombing, Imperial Japan agreed to formally surrender on Sept. 2. That date marked the official end of World War II -- the bloodiest human or natural catastrophe in history, accounting for more than 65 million dead.\nEach August, Americans in hindsight ponder the need for, the morality of, and the strategic rationale behind the dropping of the two bombs. Yet President Harry Truman's decision 73 years ago to use the novel, terrifying weapons was not considered particularly controversial, either right before or right after the attacks. Both cities were simply military targets.\nHiroshima was the headquarters of a Japanese army unit, and a key manufacturing center and port. Nagasaki -- a secondary target after clouds and smoke obscured the city of Kokura -- was the site of a huge Mitsubishi munitions plant.\nYet the sheer destructive power of the two bombs -- the 15-kiloton \"Little Boy\" Hiroshima bomb, and the 21-kiloton \"Fat Man\" Nagasaki bomb -- ensured catastrophic civilian casualties well beyond soldiers and munitions-plant workers. During the blasts, and long afterward due to radiation showers, perhaps 150,000 Japanese were killed.\nTruman wanted to use the bombs to avoid invading the Japanese mainland. The recent battle for Okinawa resulted in an estimated 50,000 American casualties -- the bloodiest of all the American battles of the Pacific War. Truman's military planners warned that invasions of the Japanese mainland to end the war might cost the equivalent of 20 more Okinawa campaigns.\nJapan's leaders swore that they would fight to the bitter end, bragging of their planned sacrifice as the \"Glorious Death of One Hundred Million.\" They planned to draw on 10,000 suicide planes and 10 million soldiers, militiamen and irregulars.\nTruman also had other worries.\nThe Soviet Union had done nothing during the war to harm Japan following its cynical 1941 non-aggression pact with the Japanese. But in August 1945, the Soviets were opportunistically preparing to invade a reeling Japanese empire in hopes of stripping Japan of its colonies in China, the Pacific and Korea. After Josef Stalin's recent Russian occupation of Eastern Europe, the idea of a Soviet Russia replacing Imperial Japan seemed not much better to Truman.\nThousands of Allied prisoners, as well as civilians in Japanese-occupied China, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, were dying each day the war dragged on. More than 1 million Japanese soldiers abroad were still brutally killing the innocent.\nThere were still other less publicized considerations. The incendiary B-29 bombing campaign from the distant Mariana Islands had already killed far more Japanese than would the two atomic bombs.\nWith new airfields on Okinawa, Gen. Curtis LeMay envisioned a far greater force of four-engine bombers to be sent on daily missions against Japan. LeMay would have had at his disposal nearly 10,000 four-engine bombers, including B-29s, along with transfers of idle B-24s"}

But before you let your emotions take over, you need to tackle the most important piece of the homeownership puzzle...the mortgage.\nWith a financial commitment this large, you\u2019ll want to obtain your loan from someone you trust, and that can be through a mortgage broker or a mortgage bank/lender. For real estate newbies, you may wonder, what\u2019s the difference?\nA mortgage broker is someone who shops your mortgage application to various lending institutions for the best deal.\nJanice Szur, senior mortgage consultant with Union Home Mortgage, says a broker is an intermediate, similar to an insurance broker.\nYou have to fill out the mortgage application only once. After that, the broker contacts the lenders on your behalf.\nA broker has access to many different lenders.\nPaying a fee for the broker's help. It depends on the specifics of the loan and the broker, but having a middleman can sometimes lead to higher fees and costs. Always carefully read all of your loan documents and ask about any fees you don't understand.\nWorking with a broker may slow down your application process, because the broker has to shop around.\nInstead of using a broker, your other option is to go directly to the source, whether that\u2019s a bank, credit union, or mortgage company. When you go with a direct lender, they handle all of the loan originations steps, from application through closing.\nShelly Starr, branch manager and mortgage loan consultant with AmeriFirst Home Mortgage, says that even within these institutions there are differences.\nStarr says that mortgage lenders -- as well as mortgage brokers -- need to be licensed with the state in which they originate loans, and they are also required to complete annual continuing education. Banks and credit union loan officers are not required to do so as they are covered under the bank liability umbrella.\nYou can be as hands-on as you want to be in finding the right deal for you.\nIf you go with your own banking institution, you may qualify for customer loyalty rates.\nIf you use your bank, the paperwork is faster and easier.\nIt's up to you to do all the shopping around, which can be overwhelming, especially if you're a first time home buyer.\nYou have to fill out a separate application every time.\nThe bottom line is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to mortgages.

Fronted by singer-songwriter-rhythm guitarist Lane, who cut her musical teeth in the California folk-rock scene before setting up shop in Cambridge, the band came across as a tight, solid quintet with both great songs and a bit of filler on the studio albums, yet were fierier and more exciting on the live EP, recorded at the Orpheum in Boston.

Based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 Wizard of Oz spinoff novel, it was an instant hit on Broadway, but few would have predicted how enduring and international its success would be.\nWhen it first travelled to London, Idina Menzel made the trip for three months to ensure a smooth transition, but it has survived her short stay. With the staging and score unchanged, it's this continued renewal of the cast that gives a slightly different edge and an excuse - if any were needed - to hop on our broomstick once more.\nWicked: The Movie - What does the theatre cast think?\nHaving aced the role in three languages in three countries (Netherlands, Germany and on Broadway) Willemijn Verkaik plays wicked witch Elphaba, with Savannah Stevenson joining as Glinda. Jeremy Taylor plays the corner of their love triangle as Fiyero - looking equal parts Eddie Redmayne and Andy Murray squeezed into Bowie Labyrinth tights.\nFor the uninitiated, the story is a parallel tale to the original Oz. We find out just how the wicked and good witches of L Frank Baum's original book (and Judy Garland's movie) first met - the differences that pulled them apart and friendship that bound them together.\nAll pretty straightforward stuff, and with its shaking up of such a well-known and beloved classic, it could well be thought gimmicky. But you don't get to a decade on Broadway just by piggybacking on the shoulders of giants.\nThe reasons for Wicked's staying power are simple. A universal story with real depth, characters that break your heart, a book with more wit and easy charm than much of theatreland put together, and - of course - irresistibly memorable songs that stay wedged in your brain from the first listen.\nThere's also understated but effective choreography and staging that's striking enough to catch your eye but not distract you from what's going on. And in Verkaik and Stevenson, the new London cast of Wicked is blessed not only with two great singers to play the iconic leads, but a pair who are certainly among the best actors.\nTogether with the songs and book, these key acting performances bring out several fully-developed themes that would keep lesser productions afloat all by themselves. From (un)requited love, sibling rivalry and true friendship to wider ideas of prejudice, racism, mob justice and the corrupting influence of power, Wicked is deceptively deep under all its glister.\nAs well as quirky and imaginative origin stories for the characters we know and love, there are the cheeky winks to literary and cinematic parents (\"I'll be so happy, I could melt!\", \"Lemons and melons and pears, oh my!\"). These are delivered well enough tonight by the incoming actors to elicit laughs even from the green-face-painted hoards who have likely seen the show more times than some of the cast.\nEqual parts Clueless's makeover queen Cher and Legally Blonde's dippy Elle, Glinda is a role that runs the risk of being squeaky, but with her operatic projection and solid acting chops, Stevenson never irritates. Verkaik is equally impressive as the outsider who flips vulnerability into magical strength.\nAnd yes, those songs we"}

Unlike today, Johnson\u2019s impeachment arose from differences with Congress over the most fundamental questions of public policy: How should the country be reunited; who was entitled to the rights of American citizens; what should be the status of the emancipated slaves?\nJohnson\u2019s Reconstruction policy is often described as one of \u201cleniency\u201d toward the South. It was lenient enough to white Southerners, to whom Johnson quickly restored control over local affairs. To the 4 million emancipated slaves, however, Johnson\u2019s lily-white plan of Reconstruction was extremely punitive. Johnson ordered black families evicted from land on which they had been settled by the US Army, and through the notorious Black Codes the Southern governments he created attempted to reduce blacks back to the condition of dependent plantation laborers.\nBetween 1865 and 1867 Northern Republicans slowly became convinced that Reconstruction must recognize blacks as citizens with equality before the law and, for men, the right to vote. Johnson, a thoroughgoing racist, opposed these policies. The 1866 Congressional elections, a sweeping victory for the Republicans, demonstrated that, unlike Clinton, Johnson had little popular support. Yet Johnson attempted to use the patronage and his command of the Army to obstruct Congressional policies.\nThe catalyst for Johnson\u2019s impeachment was his flouting of the Tenure of Office Act, which forbade the dismissal of certain federal officials without Senate approval. Claiming the law was unconstitutional, Johnson removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. That action became the basis of the Articles of Impeachment.\nIn the end, even though Republicans commanded well above a two-thirds majority in the Senate, seven moderates voted to acquit, fearing damage to the separation of powers were Johnson removed and assured by Johnson\u2019s attorneys that he would stop obstructing Congressional policy. The final vote was 35 to 19, one short of the two-thirds needed for conviction.\nNo one ever voted for Andrew Johnson for President of the United States. Bill Clinton was twice elected by the American people. For a partisan majority in Congress to remove him from office in the absence of persuasive evidence that his actions have damaged the body politic would do far more harm to American democracy than Clinton\u2019s sordid deeds."}

If your life will permit you the flexibility to roll with a giant fare dip when it occurs, you can use the resultant date as a starting point from which to plan the rest of your trip.\nThat's when you need to hit the Internet. With so many confusing websites dedicated to travel, there is one that stands out when searching for affordable airfare: Kayak.com.\nKayak quickly and simply calls up the lowest fares for your designated itinerary and displays that information in graphic detail for side-by-side comparison. The site incorporates data from hundreds of travel sites like Orbitz, Travelocity and all of the airlines. There is a simple, easy-to-use toolbar allowing you to refine the results by adjusting several trip variables. You simply modify your found itinerary via sliding bars and check boxes. The variables are how many stops you can tolerate (nonstop, one stop, or two or more stops), maximum time of layovers, desired time of departure and arrival, which airlines to include or exclude, etc. As you adjust the itinerary by these variables, the results window instantly eliminates and updates according to your new criterion.\nKayak also displays graphically the lowest available fare for each day of any month for your itinerary. Expect fares to increase within seven days of departure during and surrounding holidays, and for all time periods when kids are out of school. Normal fares from D/FW Airport to Hawaii, for example, average $800-$1,100 per person round-trip during summer months and holiday breaks. During the remainder of the year, the lowest fares average $550-$650 per person. The fare difference is even more stark to Europe or Asia.\nOnce you've entered your itinerary and the results are displayed, you may opt for another valuable Kayak feature -- a fare alert via e-mail for your selected itinerary. You can chose from daily, weekly or monthly e-mails that will show, at a glance, what is happening to your airfare among the lowest priced airlines flying that route. It will also show you if the fare has increased or decreased and by how much since your last notification.\nIt was via this daily update that I was alerted to an incredible plunge in a fare for a recent international trip. Finding something that exceeds even the truly affordable deal that you've been searching for feels like going to Vegas and being dealt a royal flush.\nMy e-mail brought word that a first-class fare had dropped down to only a few dollars above a coach ticket. This fare offered wide, comfortable seats that reclined to nearly flat (nice for a 9-hour overnight flight), superb meals served course-by-course with actual real silverware (including ... yes ... a metal knife), an amenity kit containing a cornucopia of items geared toward making the flight more comfortable (foot-warming socks, a hair brush, toothbrush, lip balm, a mask to block out light while sleeping).

Instead, the intended amendments will make matters even worse,\" Fritz said.\nSouth African social workers have exceedingly high caseloads, well over 100 on average, despite South African norms and standards recommending a maximum of 60. Social workers in developed countries like the UK and US have far less, at around 20 to 30 children per social worker.\n\u201cI call on all professional bodies, religious groups, child protection organisations, NPOs and civil society to speak up against these amendments so that no child is denied an opportunity to a loving and caring home.\n\u201cIn a country with an estimated 3.7 million orphaned and vulnerable children, legislation should facilitate the seamless adoption of children,\" Fritz said."}

I was dragged into the movie theatre with reassurances from my friends that this was the \u201cmovie of the summer\u201d.\nI quickly took out my phone and Googled the movie, cringing at the prospect of sitting stationery for two hours. I tried my best to come up with a believable excuse to get out of it but all efforts proved futile.\nOne thing was for sure: a movie featuring Dave Batista and Vin Diesel would undoubtedly be a train wreck. Chris Pratt, for me, was going to be this film\u2019s only saving grace. But how wrong I was in my presumptions! Walking out of the cinema I had a massive smile on my face, because Guardians of the Galaxy exceeded my every expectation.\nUndoubtedly, this was the bravest project that Marvel has taken on in recent times. The guidelines by which Marvel played was chucked out the window with Guardians of the Galaxy; for the first time they dared to make a movie based on characters not prevalent in mainstream culture.\nJames Gunn had the mammoth task of bringing to life and interest virtually unknown characters; he was essentially following up previous juggernauts with an indie film. What transpired, however, is a movie that is witty, devoid of cheesy dialogue and characters that complement each other splendidly.\nThe protagonist, Peter Quill, (played by the lovable Chris Pratt) is an instantly likeable character; his wit and humour are not unlike the ones fans of Park and Recreations are used to. I did have my reservations of seeing him as a lead; to me he seemed as an actor most potent on the fringes, I thought it would be almost uncomfortable to see him sink his teeth into a lead role. However, my reservations proved to be baseless as the role of Peter Quill fit him like a glove; what followed was a protagonist who was funny and instantly relatable.\nBradley Cooper has been overlooked for too long; his performance as Rocket was bang on target. The one-liners by Rocket was what kept the movie going along seamlessly and the chemistry between the characters (human or Computer Generated Imagery-CGI) was commendable. The special effects were breath-taking, admittedly not on the level of say, Avatar; Guardians of the Galaxy still packs a strong enough punch.\nHowever, one criticism for the character of Peter Quill is that, at times, he lacked a sense of originality. As mentioned above, I was still used to seeing Andy Dwyer in a sci-fi action film, rather than the actor, Chris Pratt. Furthermore, one way that the Guardians of the Galaxy can be a problem to some people is the time it takes to establish the characters. Unlike The Avengers, groundwork needed to be laid down of every character, because for the majority of the audience, the heroes were unrecognisable.\nThis took a large chunk of the film early on, and if you are someone who lacks patience while watching a movie, this aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy could be off-putting for you.\nAll in all, Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 although way outside of Marvel\u2019s comfort zone \u2013 still works like a charm. The on-screen chemistry from the characters, including a commendable effort from Zoe Saldana and Dave Batista keep the movie entertaining.

Male or female, civilian or military, employed or not, young or old, every person must be building some sort of retirement assets in their own name.\nThe \"in your own name\" part is the key. My husband has served in the military a long time, and so his military pension is going to be relatively significant. In theory, that will benefit me in retirement. However, I can't rely on that. It is essential that I also have some retirement funds that are just mine.\nIf you have a job working for someone else, you have two options: an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or your employer's plan. In a perfect world, you'll contribute to both. You should choose your employer's plan if the company matches a portion of your contributions. No company match? An IRA may be a simpler choice, especially if you anticipate changing jobs frequently.\nSelf-employed individuals can open a SEP IRA, Simple IRA, or Individual 401(k) in addition to a regular IRA. A small business is a great idea for anyone who is trying to maximize their savings in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. You can open a self-employed account even if you have a job that allows you to contribute to a 401(k) or 403(b).\nNon-working spouses can open IRAs. If the person opening the IRA does not have earned income, but their spouse does, the IRS calls a spousal IRA, but most people just call it an IRA. Spousal IRAs are subject to the same contribution limits as other IRAs, and the working spouse must earn enough income to cover the IRA contributions of both partners.\nI often meet with couples who, purposefully or accidentally, are prioritizing one partner's retirement savings over the other partner's retirement savings. It's a bad idea. Creating retirement savings for each partner is financially smart, plus it sets a positive tone for your whole relationship. It's a win-win choice."}

It's not the biographical film this stupendous, if mightily troubled, musical and political figure deserved, especially coming in the immediate wake of Liz Garbus' riveting documentary What Happened, Miss Simone? last year. Ironically, however, the latter film might help the new one find a bit more of an audience than it would have otherwise, by virtue of having reawakened public awareness of this convulsively talented, if sometimes self-destructive, artist. Still, theatrical returns will be meager for the sporadically intense drama, which was shot in 2012, with interested parties more likely to check it out in home-access venues.\nDebuting feature writer-director Cynthia Mort has spent nearly her entire career until now in television, variously as a writer, director and/or producer on the likes of Roseanne, Will & Grace and Tell Me You Love Me, while also writing Neil Jordan's feature The Brave One.

But even if the late-in-life traumas, which also include breast cancer, possess undeniable drama, they can't really compare with the more singular experiences of her life decades earlier, especially in the 1960s, events that are only glancingly dramatized, if at all.\nThe decision to focus on Nina's last years also"}

It\u2019s available now as a free download from the App Store, with optional in-app purchases of in-game currency or a one-time unlock of all game content.\nUnderline is a word puzzle game that combines elements of traditional \u201cfalling block\u201d puzzle games with the word-finding gameplay of board games such as Boggle and modern mobile adaptations like Scramble With Friends. Players must score as many points as possible by making words from a grid of letters. This is achieved by tapping and dragging from one letter to the next horizontally, vertically or diagonally, at which point if the word is valid, it will disappear. New letters gradually drop in from the top one at a time, progressing gradually across the columns. After the player has made a certain number of words, a new \u201cwave\u201d begins, and a large number of letters drop down to fill in the gaps.\nThe game is a little tricky to play on the small screen of an iPhone or iPod touch as the letters are a bit small and difficult to slide one\u2019s finger over. Anticipating this issue, the developers included an optional \u201cmagnify\u201d function, but it\u2019s still a little inaccurate and difficult to make movements at times, particularly diagonally. Since the game can get quite fast-paced at times, this is something of an issue, though it is negated somewhat by playing on the larger screen of an iPad.\nThe game features four game modes, three of which are initially locked. restricting the player to \u201cClassic Mode.\u201d Classic Mode tasks players with surviving until a column overflows with letter tiles; Time Attack mode requires players to keep a timer topped up by playing words, with longer words adding more time; Wordsearch mode starts with a solid grid and challenges players to find as many words as possible in two minutes, with new letters immediately dropping in when a word is made; finally, Pass and Play mode follows the rules of Classic Mode, but takes the form of a two-player competition. There is no means of asynchronous multiplayer competition, though several modes would lend themselves well to online play.\nThe game monetizes through in-app purchases of in-game currency, which can be used to unlock the additional game modes or purchase powerups to be used in a single game. These range from the ability to drop a rain of vowels on the play area to freezing the timer or immediately clearing the bottom row of the play area. It\u2019s also possible to unlock all the game content with a single in-app purchase, and the game is also supported by both banner and full-screen ads.\nUnderline is a very good puzzle game at heart, control issues aside. It features fun mechanics, unobtrusive monetization and the ability to compete against friends using Game Center functionality and the ability to tweet scores. It would be good to see the addition of some direct competitive modes \u2014 perhaps using Game Center\u2019s asynchronous multiplayer system \u2014 but for now this is a solid addition to the crowded mobile puzzle genre, and worthy of note for being a little more original than the scores of bubble-shooters and match-3 puzzlers.\nYou can follow Underline\u2019s progress with AppData, our tracking service for mobile and social games and developers.\nA good game that successfully combines elements of falling-block puzzles and Boggle."}

Working hard with your own hands to provide for your needs and the needs of your family is central to what it means to be a man. You have been called to be both a protector and a provider for your family.\nOne of my good friends was independently wealthy, and did not need to work a single day in his life. (To his credit, he developed a successful career as a pastor and then a counselor, refusing to coast on inherited wealth.) I wasn't in his position. If I didn't work, my family didn't eat.\nI've never regretted that, even for a single day, and never wished I could have traded places with him. I drew great satisfaction knowing that my wife and my children were depending on me, and that I was taking care of them. \"The laborer's appetite works for him; his hunger drives him on\" (Proverbs 16:26, NIV). I like to eat, and I wanted my family to be able to eat, and that drove me to work hard.\nIn fact, I'd urge you not even to think about retiring. Sure, you may reach a point where you can slow down, and may shift your energies to a different kind of work. For instance, I have a good friend who \"retired\" from a long and successful career with a high tech firm, but soon found himself working as an administrator in his local church. As men, God made to engage in productive work as long as God gives us breath. As I used to tell the men in my church, don't retire, reload.\nSome people wrongly think that work is a consequence of sin, but that's not what the Bible teaches. God placed man in the garden of Eden \"to work it and to keep it\" (Genesis 2:16), well before sin entered the human race.\nNow to be sure, sin has made work more difficult than God intended it to be. Because of Adam's sin, God said, \"Cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you...by the sweat of your face you shall eat bread\" (Genesis 3:16-19).\nNotice the promise God has made to us here. Even though work will be tiring and frustrating at times, nevertheless God assures you that through your hard work \"you shall eat.\"\nThere is no job that is free of \"thorns and thistles,\" little things that keep a good job from being a perfect job. I was talking with a friend of mine once, back in the 1980s, before the era of computers had arrived. He was an insurance adjuster, and he loved every part of his work except for one thing: his employer insisted that every form he turned in had to be filled out in triplicate, meaning he had to turn in three copies of every form.\nIn those days, he had to use a typewriter and carbon paper, which had ink that kept getting all over his hands. It was a perfect job, except for that one little thing, and it aggravated him no end. Every job you ever have will have its thorns and thistles, its carbon paper, but my friend worked hard at his job and it enabled him to support himself and his family.\nAnd so it will be for you.

And this means big, big changes for credit card security.\nIf you\u2019re an American with a credit card, the odds are good you received a replacement card in the mail lately. These cards, with an embedded chip inside referred to as an EMV, are part of a major shift in the way credit cards work in America: In late 2015 and going into 2017, financial liability for credit card fraud will shift to stores and merchants if they don\u2019t accept these EMV chip cards. This means that store owners are rushing to buy the expensive equipment to process EMV chip cards, and card issuers are pumping out cards as quickly as customers can activate them.\nThe United States is a holdover in adopting chip credit cards; they were adopted in most other wealthy parts of the world years ago, but did not enter into the American economy as banks and merchants argued who would be responsible for the cost of the changeover. This writer personally remembers a cashier at an English corner shop in a working-class corner of east London in 2011 laughing at loud at his credit card, wondering why a country so powerful had credit cards so crappy.\nBut the shift over to these credit cards has meant new and more sophisticated measures for credit card security. These changeovers are taking place whether you stand on line at a supermarket, buy goods online, or even just pay your utility bill.\nStarting today, credit card issuers that don\u2019t send customers EMV chip cards and retailers that don\u2019t implement EMV chip readers will be on the hook financially for credit card fraud. Some retailers are opting to bite the cost by raising prices for customers instead of going through the (expensive and time-consuming) process of training employees to use the new card readers and install equipment, but others are looking for new ways to reduce fraud with the new chip cards.\nMasterCard, which is partially responsible for EMV\u2019s name (EMV, as it turns out, stands for Eurocard, MasterCard, Visa after the protocol\u2019s creators), is testing out a new product they refer to as \u201cSelfie Pay.\u201d In trials taking place in the United States and Europe, customers will be able to verify their identity for mobile e-commerce purchases by\u2026yes, taking a selfie.\nIn the pilot project currently underway, taking place with Silicon Valley\u2019s First Tech Federal Credit Union and other stakeholders, every time a customer makes a MasterCard purchase using an app on their phone, a picture is taken of them. The picture is essentially used to authenticate the user\u2019s identity in two-step authentication on top of the password, and is cross-compared against a picture of the user MasterCard has on file.\nAccording to Ajay Bhalla, president of MasterCard\u2019s enterprise solutions division, the adoption of EMV chips led to fraud at in-person points of sales reducing by 80%. But as he put it, \u201cfraudsters migrate to the digital world\u201d as in-person purchases get safer.\nThe giant credit card provider is also working on several other biometric two-factor authentication tests. These include heartbeat readers worn on a user\u2019s wrist, which essentially uses a heartbeat as an individual signature, and voice recognition or iris recognition projects.\nEye recognition figures greatly in another biometric project from the finance world that, even though it doesn\u2019t involve credit cards, gives a hint of where credit card authentication is going.\nSecil Watson, the head of wholesale Internet solutions for Wells Fargo, has a challenge: Her division is responsible"}

The film tells the story of a man who accidentally sets a fire that kills his children. He wasn\u2019t prosecuted.\nHeather Franklin's plea agreement takes into account her acceptance of responsibility for her actions surrounding the circumstances of Jeffrey's death, said Acting District Attorney Michael Ferrarese.\nShe originally faced a murder charge, and Ferrarese said he believed the legally admissible evidence would have convicted her of it, but this is \"a just plea,\" given the circumstances.\nIf Heather's case had gone to trial, Ferrarese said, testimony would have demonstrated her mistreatment and frustration toward Jeffrey. Facebook posts also showed her hostility.\nJeffrey had been deaf and mute, and lived with behavioral issues that created a stressful home environment for his adoptive parents, which Ferrarese said helped motivate the crime.\nBy February 2017, Heather was also pregnant with the couple's first biological child.\nInvestigators believed the fire began in a wood stove on the southern end of the Franklin home in Guilford.\nThe vent pipe was in good working order, Ferrarese said, and it's suspected that Ernest Franklin left the stove door open so the fire could spread.\nMeanwhile, Heather Franklin drove into Norwich and surrounding areas.\nShe stopped at the Walmart in Norwich, returned to the vicinity near the Franklin home from 12:42 to 12:46 a.m., then drove to Price Chopper in Sidney for about 10 minutes, according to Ferrarese.\nThen, she drove around Bainbridge and Coventry, before returning to the fire scene by 2:18 that morning.\nErnest Franklin, 36, faces up to 25 years to life in state prison when he's sentenced for felony counts of second-degree murder, third-degree arson and tampering with physical evidence. Jurors in Chenango County Court spent an hour and 40 minutes deliberating before finding him guilty on all charges.\nFerrarese said there were \"100 percent burns\" to Jeffrey's body, but there were no signs of soot or smoke in the boy's wind pipe or lungs.

For example, companies that spend more than \u00a350,000 a year will receive additional assistance from the Carbon Trust, who will send out agents to evaluate your business and make recommendations free of charge. With this in mind, it is well worth investing in carbon reduction generators to achieve the long-term goal of sustainability.\nBuy and Source Locally: The concept of buying goods locally is an extremely popular one among modern consumers, and this has prompted firms and governments throughout the world to embrace it with equal enthusiasm. Although it has a positive impact on local communities and the wider economy, purchasing local goods also reduces global fuel consumption and the need for international logistics.

The theory is that by keeping their prey in check, predators can protect the plants and smaller animals that their prey eat.\nSuraci saw an opportunity to test this theory when he noticed raccoons on the Gulf Islands spent a lot of their time gorging on seafood because they had little to fear.\n\"Some of these beaches on the Gulf Islands are simply loaded with raccoons,\" he said.\n\"They barely ever look up from foraging.\"\nSuraci and his colleagues set up five speakers on several beaches and played various sounds, ranging from barking dogs to sea lion sounds. They found that while the raccoons ignored the sea lion sounds and continued eating, they reacted immediately to the perceived presence of dogs.\n\"Our research definitely supports the idea that the natural re-colonization of large carnivores should be supported,\" said Suraci.\nHe says this is the first time the role of large carnivore fear in food webs has been demonstrated in an experiment.\nThe perceived presence of dogs, triggered by barking sounds, may be enough to scare the raccoons for a few months, but they will soon overcome that fear said Suraci.\n\"They're going to realize that bark has no bite eventually and they're going to start ignoring it.\"\nLong term change would require the actual reintroduction of the raccoon's natural predators, like cougars, wolves or bears, he said.\n\"There are potentially some short term targeted management applications you can do with just the sound of fear, but essentially if you want to do long term ecosystem restoration, you're going to really have to actually bring the large carnivores back.\"\nEcologists often point to the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park as an example of how carnivores can rejuvenate an ecosystem. The wolves kept the elk population in check, which in turn gave the overeaten vegetation a chance to recover, according to Suraci.\nLocal residents may not like the idea of cougars coming back to inhabited parts of the island, but Suraci says people can look to Europe for examples of success. Wolf and bear populations there are starting to recover after centuries of hunting.\n\"Through proper outreach and education, the local communities are dealing with them quite well,\" he said.\n\"I think similar things could happen here in the Gulf Islands.\"\nTo listen to the full"}

He has a better chance of winning games next season than Webb, who hasn't yet played an NFL snap, or a rookie.\nHowever, just because Manning is the Giants' best short-term option doesn't mean that he'll be good enough.\nIn next year's NFC East, bringing back Manning arguably gives the Giants at best the third-best quarterback/offensive situation in the division.\nPhiladelphia's Carson Wentz, one of the budding stars in the entire NFL, will be healthy with a formidable offensive line and running game at his disposal. And the Cowboys' Dak Prescott, who badly missed Ezekiel Elliott during his six-game suspension for domestic violence in 2017, should have his top runner back to punish defenses.\nWashington's situation is unenviable and in flux: they either have to tag Kirk Cousins a third time for an absurd amount of money or find another solution in free agency or the draft.\nBut Gettleman has to deliver on his promise to improve the offensive line, and Manning has to deliver on his vow to himself that he can muster more mojo than he was able to in 2017 to let the Giants compete. Otherwise, there truly will be no reason not to move on from Manning with an eye on the future.\nThe Giants presumably would handle Manning's next exit more tactfully and gracefully than this past"}

Labour said ministers were \"incompetent\".\nAfter the amendment, food such as sausage rolls or pasties sold on shelves - that is, cooling down, rather than being kept hot in a special cabinet - will not be liable for VAT.\nDuring a parliamentary debate last week, MPs from all three main parties criticised Mr Osborne's proposals, arguing they were unenforceable and would have an adverse impact on jobs and businesses.\nCurrently, VAT is not charged on most food and drink, or hot baked goods, but is payable on takeaway food sold to be eaten hot.\nHowever, hot savouries including pasties and pies are exempt. The U-turn would effectively maintain this situation where they are left to return to \"ambient temperatures\" on shelves in bakeries and supermarkets.\nSheryll Murray, Conservative MP for South East Cornwall, said: \"I told the government that I didn't want to see an army of thermometer-wielding tax inspectors poking our pasties and that I was really concerned about the vagaries of ambient temperature. They listened.\"\nLiberal Democrat MP Stephen Gilbert, who represents Newquay, added: \"The Cornish people have won and there will be dancing in streets from Land's End to the Tamar as people hear that the government has dropped its plans to clobber local people and local businesses with this tax.\"\nStatic caravans do not currently incur VAT. The new 5% rate will be delayed from October to April next year.\nA Treasury said: \"The Budget announced a consultation on a change to VAT on hot takeaway food, designed to remove inconsistency and ambiguity in the system and level the playing field across the takeaway food market.\n\"After extensive engagement we have improved the policy, addressing practical concerns, ensuring that the new regime could be as simple as possible to apply.\n\"We have addressed these in a way that allows us to remove the inconsistent VAT treatment, while not imposing any additional requirement on businesses to test the temperature of their products.\"\nFor Labour, shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said: \"This government is proving time and time again they can't think through policies before it makes announcements.\n\"It really ought to have got some of these consultations done before the chancellor decided to put up the taxes.\"\nHe added: \"To go along making policy reverses is an incompetent way to run the government.\""}

For their own safety, they say, they want Turkey's military to move across the border to protect them.\nSecretary of State Colin Powell has voiced concern about any Turkish military action, saying the Bush administration doesn't want \"to see anything happen that would precipitate a crisis between Turkey and the Kurdish populations in northern Iraq.\"\nThe Turkmen cause could do exactly that. Turkmens are Iraq's third largest ethnic group after the Arabs and Kurds, and Ankara wants Washington to provide stronger guarantees that the Turkmens will have the same political, cultural and territorial rights as the Kurds in a postwar Iraq.\nSuch rights would allow Turkey to shape a postwar Iraq through the Turkmens. The Turkmens, in effect, would become a buffer against Kurdish aspirations to forge an independent state that could embrace parts of Turkey.\n\"The Turkmens are a card in the overall Iraq game, and if Turkey uses this card to its maximum effect, Turkey's insecurities will be helped.\" said Tarik Oguzlu, a political analyst who has written a study on the Turkmens. \"The Turkmens are now considered a kind of leverage, both with the Kurds and the Americans.\"\nFor decades, the Iraqi regime denied Turkmens government jobs and other rights. Thousands were chased away from their homes\u2014as were Kurds\u2014and replaced by southern Arabs under Saddam's infamous \"Arabization\" campaign.\nTurkey, concerned about its relations with Baghdad, rarely voiced any protest, even during alleged killings of Turkmens in the 1950s and 1980s.\nBut since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, there's been a national awakening to the Turkmens' cause.

Thomas encounters Christ when he is invited to put his fingers in Christ\u2019s scarred hands and side.\nTo Thomas, the Lord Jesus Christ said, \u201cBecause you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed (John 20:29).\u201d In the beginning of the Epistle of John we read these words, \u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched \u2013 this we proclaim concerning the Word of Life. The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. We write this to make your joy complete (1 John 1:1-4).\u201d If the gospel writer John is the same as the epistle writer John, we can see again both aspects \u2013 those who have seen and those who have not seen.\nFrom time to time, modern people tell us they have seen Jesus. I do not want to say that their vision or perception is impossible, but I think the majority of us (since the return of Jesus Christ in heaven), fall in the second category \u2013 those who have not seen and have still believed.\nOur belief in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ is not based on imagining the resurrection. Our belief is formed on the witnesses of those who have been with Jesus \u2013 Thomas, John, Peter, and the rest. They have seen and they have testified to others about what they have seen.\nNow as a historian, I read lots of accounts. I do not have any doubts that Alexander the Great existed, even though I have never seen him. I have read enough accounts of his battles and the fact that the world of his days became a world that was known as the Hellenic world. He has conquered the world, and even though he has died very young, no one denies that he did exist and he changed the world.\nI do not have any doubts that Napoleon existed. If I travel to France, I see many statues dedicated to him and if I read the English history, I see they take great pride in telling the current readers that they defeated Napoleon. I have never met Napoleon, but as a historian I have evaluated the evidence and I do not have any doubt that Napoleon existed and that he wanted to rule the world.\nContinuing my historical research, I come to the same conclusion about the Lord Jesus Christ. The presence and the activity of Jesus Christ are undeniable. The actions of Jesus Christ are historical, and even though I did not see the historical Jesus, I believe that He did exist and did the things that the eye witnesses wrote down. The great difference between my accepting the historicity of Alexander the Great or Napoleon is that this knowledge has never created any great joy in my life. The difference in the historical Jesus is that John tells me that believing in Him should bring joy in life. I fellowship with the apostolic church; but I also fellowship with the Holy God \u2013 God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.\nI am in that vast category of believers that have never seen the Lord Jesus Christ the way that Thomas did, but I believe as fervently as he did.

And most of the rest \u2014 along with other state immigration laws regarding human smuggling and denying bond to undocumented immigrants \u2014 was whittled away in subsequent federal court rulings that said immigration control was the business of federal government, not individual states.\nIn effect, all that remained of the law was two clauses in Section 2, known as the \"show me your papers\" clause. Those clauses served as a largely symbolic victory for the Arizona politicians who championed the anti-illegal-immigration law.\nSection 2(b) requires law-enforcement officers to make a \"reasonable attempt\" to determine the immigration status of people stopped for other reasons if \"reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States.\"\nSection 2(d) allowed law enforcement to transport illegal immigrants to federal custody.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld those provisions, although the coalition, which includes the National Immigration Law Center and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), continued litigation.\nThe agreement announced Thursday includes a $1.4 million payment of legal fees by the state and an informal opinion from the Arizona Attorney General's Office that sets guidelines for law-enforcement officers when they encounter people who may be in the country illegally. In return, the coalition will drop its legal claims and appeals.\n\"It's the first time that a chief Arizona law enforcement officer has recognized that there are limits to Sections 2(b) and 2(d),\" said Cecillia Wang, one of the lead attorneys for the ACLU.\n\"After a six-year saga of litigating SB 1070, it's coming to an end,\" Wang said.\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich called the settlement \"common sense.\"\n\"You can't profile. You can't make illegal stops,\" he said. \"These are things we all agree on. It's bad policing\"\nArizona was in the forefront of states crafting legislation to curb illegal immigration.\nWang was one of the lead attorneys in a separate racial-profiling case that led to civil contempt-of-court charges and a referral for criminal contempt against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. She believes SB 1070 arose when the state tried to model laws on Arpaio's practices of rounding up illegal immigrants.\nFact Check: Did SB 1070 reduce crime in Arizona?\nMost of the statutes were blocked in federal court, including laws making it illegal to harbor or transport undocumented immigrants or to solicit day labor, and requiring non-citizen registration.\nThe racial-profiling case against the Sheriff's Office further codified what state and local law enforcement could do while stopping individuals who might not be citizens.\n\"The reality is that our informal opinion sets out what the state of the law is,\" Brnovich said"}

There is, however, something extraordinary useful when embarking on such a walk and that is Birdsong ID.\nThis wildlife app is described by its founders Isoperia as \u2018Shazam for birds\u2019, meaning that people can point the app whenever it hears birdsong and it will identify the type of bird.

The ability to automatically name a bird by its song has always been a bit of a Holy Grail, but our app allows people to do this.\n\u201cAlthough there\u2019s an obvious comparison to Shazam, the challenges are different. We are dealing with bird songs that are competing with other noises in the environment. Birds from the same species have variations in their songs \u2013 and the songs they make will change over time,\u201d said Mark Haley, founder of Isoperla.\nThese challenges appear to have been overcome with Bird Watching Magazine, apparently the UK's best selling magazine for birders, rating the app nine out of ten, which said \u2018the app can be remarkably accurate\u2019.

It is not affiliated with or representing any other entity, public or private.\nWhat do you get when you combine the magic of Michael Jackson\u2019s music with the talents and creativity of the entertainment colossus known as Cirque du Soleil? A damn fine evening thank you. The kind that inspires thoughts of gratitude and appreciation for recovery.\nThe tickets to the Arco Arena event, Michael Jackson\u2019s Immortal World Tour, were purchased a year ago as a present for my wife. Then we waited till the evening came around. As fans of M.J., especially after seeing his \u201cThis Is It\u201d movie, and of Cirque du Soleil, our expectations were high.\nThe pairing seemed a perfect combination, Michael and Cirque seem(ed) always to be setting the bar higher, trying to outdo past triumphs, stake a claim on excellence that few will come near. Our expectations were exceeded.\nBut the event was about more than world class entertainment in the same way that recovery is about more than abstinence. It was a celebration of human imagination and creativity, two of the building blocks of happy abstinence. It was an honoring of the need for a time out from our ordinary routine. It was planning and execution, working it because we are worth it.\nIt was good conversation there and back, the pleasure of doing something fun together, the sublime experience of giving my wife a superb gift. It was the realization that none of it would have been possible without recovery coming first.\nIt was contemplating the difference, the way it would have happened if we were still using and somehow managed to make it to such an event, as highly unlikely as that would have been. There would have been a focus on intoxication.\nBefore the event there would have been a focus on getting the drugs, and not too soon which might have led to doing them before the event even rolled around. But not too late mind you, running the risk of missing a connection and not getting them at all.\nTiming in the world of addiction is not a skill, it\u2019s helter-skelter madness with miscues and disappointments. It\u2019s the luck of the draw. Drugs have a way of not being there when you want or need them the most, as if they are participating in your misery deliberately.\nDuring the event, we would be hoping that the pre-event dose wouldn\u2019t wear off too soon, or we would be preoccupied with finding a way to use during the event \u2014 always thinking about the maintenance of the high to the exclusion of enjoying the event the evening was supposed to be about.\nAfter the event, we would feel somewhat relieved that complications were out of the way, that the high could finally return to being the supreme focus, the exalted need, the defining purpose to which everything else revolves, return to being the warmth that the sun withholds from the dark side of our lives.\nThe enjoyment of being together, seeing wonderful feats of imagination and talent, stepping out of a routine, the beauty of giving to my wife, would all be lost to addiction\u2019s ability to become life.\nThe best news is that recovery doesn\u2019t need M.J. or Cirque du Soleil to be spectacular. The best moments involve seeing change in yourself, being there for others, watching people dream bigger and have those dreams come true.\nComments, questions or suggestions for future topics can be sent to dnfultz@yahoo.com."}

Every publishing season seems to bring fresh editions from a vital but ignored past: say, Clarice Lispector, who had one book come out last year, or Lucia Berlin, who had two. For readers, republication offers something rare: the possibility of reclaiming history simply by opening a book. The proper response to this is surely celebration. But I can\u2019t help feeling a bit depressed that so many of the cool new writers are dead.\nI\u2019ve been particularly interested in the resurgence of midcentury women novelists who share certain characteristics. These women were underappreciated in their own lifetimes. They may have gotten prizes and awards, but they never earned the fame or money of their male peers or, in many cases, their more successful husbands. They distanced themselves from the women\u2019s movement. They were rude in ways that were probably deeply unpleasant for their contemporaries but now translate nicely into witty anecdotes and retorts.\nTake Elsa Morante. Like many of the authors who are regularly discovered and rediscovered, Morante never became internationally famous. Her novels are not widely read outside of Italy, unlike those of her husband, Alberto Moravia, or the works of many of the artists she collaborated with over the course of her life, like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Natalia Ginzburg. Her novels are not difficult, but they are also not easy: violent, emotionally tangled, lushly written in a way that often reads in English as more melodramatic than dramatic, and almost overwhelmingly ambitious.\n\u201cElsa was a bit totalitarian,\u201d Moravia said of his wife after her death. A man who had escaped fascism could not have meant that lightly, but it comes across as accurate and sincere. Morante\u2019s novels have the drive of a general ready to obliterate the field. She\u2019s also one of Elena Ferrante\u2019s favorite writers, and the one from whom she derived her pen name. The connection is made very clear by the fact that this new translation of Arturo\u2019s Island is by Ferrante\u2019s translator, Ann Goldstein, and has a quote from Ferrante on the back."}

Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell. Normally, as part of the immune system, plasma cells produce antibodies that help fight against disease and keep us healthy. In multiple myeloma, these plasma cells produce antibodies that are ineffective.\nMultiple myeloma occurs when the overgrowth of plasma cells takes place in multiple areas of the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft spongy tissue in the middle part of the bone where blood cells are formed.\nThe average age of those receiving a diagnosis of multiple myeloma is 65 years. In Canada, about 2,700 people are diagnosed with multiple myeloma every year. There is a 1 in 130 lifetime chance of developing multiple myeloma.\nIt is not known what causes myeloma. Normally, only 5% or less of the bone marrow is made up of plasma cells. When a plasma cell becomes abnormal and begins multiplying, the cells are then called myeloma cells. Myeloma cells have special \"adhesion molecules\" that help them target bone marrow. In cases of myeloma, the plasma cells usually make up 10% or more of the bone marrow. Myeloma cells make a special type of protein to stimulate new blood vessels to form. These blood vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cells.\nThere are other possible risk factors, such as obesity, exposure to high dose radiation and chemicals, but these have not been proven.\nOvergrowth of myeloma cells disrupts the production of normal cells in the bone marrow. This causes an impaired immune system and a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Decrease in red blood cells can lead to anemia and fatigue, which is common in people with multiple myeloma. Bone fractures (broken bones) are another complication of multiple myeloma.\nDiagnosis of multiple myeloma depends on a number of factors. Blood or urine test results following a routine doctor's visit may provide the first indication of multiple myeloma. The combination of these results along with other tests, as well as your symptoms, helps determine the presence or absence of the disease.\nIf your doctor suspects that you have myeloma, the next step is to take images of your bones. Your doctor may order an MRI, CT, PET/CT, or X-rays. Weakened areas of the bones are common with myeloma and may be visible in an X-ray.\nYour doctor will also take some bone marrow tissue for microscopic examination. This test is called a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, the doctor inserts a needle into the bone and removes some of the marrow along with a small piece of the bone, which is then viewed under a microscope to detect the abnormal myeloma cells.\nBecause it is not known what causes multiple myeloma, it is not possible to prevent this disease. However, you have a number of options for the treatment of multiple myeloma.\nMultiple myeloma often develops slowly and may not always have signs or symptoms. For people with multiple myeloma who are not experiencing symptoms, they may not need to start treatment right away. However, they will need regular visits to their doctor to monitor the progression of the disease.\nChemotherapy and newer therapies are common treatments for multiple myeloma. These medications directly damage and kill the abnormal myeloma cells. These medications are specifically designed to quickly attack multiplying cells, but they"}

If they do, they can share that commitment to their friends' news feeds, perhaps creating some peer pressure to get others to vote as well.\nThen, users can answer a series of questions about their political leanings, favorite candidates and stances on various issues, including the economy and healthcare, the responses to which can also be shared with friends in their newsfeeds and tickers.\n\"With Election Day right around the corner, it\u2019s time for everyone to get involved, understand the issues, and make a commitment to participate,\" wrote Facebook's Politics & Government Team in a blog post. \"We believe that the power of friends \u2013- the social dynamic that creates a societal impact \u2014 will result in a more involved citizenry that turns out on Election Day, informed about the most critical issues facing the nation.\"\n\"Everyone's talking about politics and the election on Facebook to begin with,\" said Drew Rayman of Tenthwave Digital, which developed the app. \"We wanted to see how we could create an app that lives on Facebook and lets users talk about the issues that are important to them and see what the rest of the nation is talking about. Politics has always been discussed on Facebook, but this is really the first shot over the bow in allowing such a huge social community to get involved and speak their mind to a much larger platform.\"\nUsers can also choose to have their answers anonymously gathered by the app, creating a wealth of social data about Facebook users' political leanings organized on a state-by-state basis. Any user can access that data on the app's interactive map. Additionally, CNN will treat the app as a \"second screen\" experience for its politics coverage, asking viewers to submit answers to questions via Facebook and referencing users' posted opinions throughout the election.\n\"If a user opts-in, they'll share their sentiment in a way that will contribute to CNN's understanding of people's opinions across Facebook,\" said Rayman. \"After the election's over, we'll have a world of data that may tell us some very interesting things for next time.\"\nThe app, which can be accessed here, is available in both English and Spanish-language versions.\nWould you use \"I'm Voting\" to show your friends and family which candidate has your vote?"}

Speed is an important component to his game. Therefore, taking care of his legs through an arduous baseball season remains paramount.\nInterestingly enough, that process involves very little running. Once the season starts, McDonald does almost no speed or endurance work. He gets his legs moving while shagging flies in batting practice, warming up before games and then in the games themselves. Once the last out is made, it's time for recovery.\n\"The hot and cold tub is crucial. That's the best thing you can do,\" said McDonald, one of the great stories this year for the Red Sox. \"I really just focus on that, keeping the legs strong and staying off them when you can.\"\nMcDonald, 31, admitted that maintaining muscle strength and getting work done is much easier at the major league level. There are many more devices, trainers and equipment at your disposal.\n\"It's not like the minor leagues or the old days where you pretty much ice and you're out of luck,\" he said.\nBut it's still up to the players themselves to make sure they don't enter the clubhouse for game No. 144 and feel as if they have lead in their legs.\n\"It's really the most important body part you have in this game, as far as pitching or hitting,\" McDonald said.\nMcDonald has been part of seven different organizations, playing the bulk of his games at the minor league level. The Red Sox' rash of injuries in the outfield this season have given him an opportunity, and he has run with it. In limited duty, he ranks second on the team in stolen bases and triples, two categories synonymous with speed. And his play at all three outfield positions has been solid \u2014 he leads all Boston outfielders in assists.\nWhile players around him have been in and out of the lineup all year, McDonald has avoided injury. Much of that can be attributed to the aforementioned hard work.\nThere are no guarantees for McDonald next season, however. The Red Sox could offer him a contract, but he may find more playing time on a team that needs more bodies in the outfield. Wherever he winds up, he will focus on what got him to this level, including maintenance of the wheels.\n\"You have to keep your legs fresh,\" he said."}

An agent suspected they were conducting a \u201csmuggling event,\u201d according to the statement, which did not elaborate.\nThe border agent stopped one of the vehicles and another agent stopped a second one. Multiple people from both vehicles were arrested.\nThe third vehicle kept going when agents encountered it, and a sheriff\u2019s deputy took over the chase prior to the fatal crash, the border patrol said.\nThe incident comes amid heightened tensions over the treatment of immigrants at the southern border. The Trump administration has said tougher immigration policies \u2014 even separating children from their parents \u2014 are needed to deter immigrants from coming to the country illegally. Over a six-week period ending in May, about 2,000 children had been separated from their families, administration officials said Friday.\nMost of the occupants in the SUV were believed in the country without legal permission. Boyd said the driver and one passenger were believed to be U.S. citizens. The driver was among those hospitalized, and a deputy who assisted the Border Patrol with the chase found the driver sitting upright in his seat and took him and the passenger into custody.\n\u201cThis, I think, is a perfect example, of why are borders need to be secured,\u201d Boyd said.\nSome injured were taken by helicopter to San Antonio, about 90 miles (144.83 kilometers) northeast.

He and Dr. Craig Bushong recently launched Aspen Comprehensive Health Interventions, the first ketamine-infusion clinic in the mid- to upper-Roaring Fork Valley.\nThe hospital, which is the leaseholder for the clinic, ultimately agreed. CEO David Ressler and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Eric Stahl said the proposal was vetted by physicians while the hospital\u2019s board of directors also was made aware of it.\n\u201cWe understand that (ketamine) is demonstrating effective results, and we know there\u2019s a population in Aspen that it will help,\u201d Ressler said.\nWhile it is not FDA-approved as an anti-depressant, ketamine is used in surgical anesthesia, through an IV, to put patients to sleep. But as a treatment for depression and anxiety, among other conditions including PTSD and OCD, it is considered an \u201coff-label\u201d use, meaning insurers won\u2019t cover the expenses associated with its administration.\nYet studies continue to trickle in giving the drug heightened credibility as a breakthrough medication to quickly, and safely, treat those with depression where other methods failed over time. One of the main drawbacks, however, is there is not enough data to show those findings to be conclusive.\nAt the Aspen clinic, the IV treatment lasts about 40 minutes, with doses of ketamine significantly lower than in aesthesia, Hahn and Bushong said. Ideal candidates for the treatment are those who are suicidal and in need of quick results, or others who tried antidepressants that didn\u2019t achieve the desired results. Generally speaking, patients would go through four or six rounds of infusions with follow-up treatment.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the advantage of this IV therapy, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s come to a head,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cIt is unlike an antidepressant medication that might take two to three weeks before it hits your system. This medication will work within 20 to 30 minutes. It is short-acting, meaning it\u2019s in your system in about an hour or two and during that hour or two, it\u2019s actually fixing things that may have taken a significantly longer time\u201d with other antidepressants.\nBushong has the clinic\u2019s role as the psychiatric evaluator and supervisor of the patients.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been involved in hard-to-treat cases\u201d of depression, he said."}

The dispute centers around a statute, passed by Congress in 2012, that effectively ordered a federal district court to distribute Bank Markazi\u2019s assets as restitution to the survivors and families of those killed by Iranian-sponsored terrorism. If held constitutional, the statute will enable plaintiffs to get hold of $2 billion worth of bonds, currently frozen in New York City, to satisfy some of the $43.5 billion that Iran owes to American victims. Among the plaintiffs are those affected by two catastrophic bombings in Beirut in 1983, which were conducted by the Iran-funded militant group Hezbollah. The attacks killed 17 employees at the U.S. embassy and 241 others at the U.S. Marines barracks.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s eventual decision, and the findings in many other similar cases, may provide overdue justice for terrorism victims. But these cases could become a major barrier to U.S. foreign policy, especially in light of the nuclear deal with Iran, which went into effect on October 18. Iran could potentially use ongoing disputes about these cases to shirk its obligations under the nuclear deal. Even though the deal promises to unblock Iranian funds, U.S. courts could keep Iranian assets, such as those in the Bank Markazi case, frozen. Some courts may eventually use those frozen assets to satisfy unpaid terrorism judgments\u2014a result that would hardly constitute sanctions relief."}

Childers, M.D., from the University of California in Los Angeles, and colleagues developed an epidemiologic profile of adults with uncomplicated appendicitis using data merged from the 2016 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program essential and appendectomy-targeted participant use files (12,376 adult appendectomies from 115 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program sites).\nBased on an analysis of 7,778 cases, the researchers found that almost all patients (96.1 percent) received preoperative imaging, with most (79.2 percent) receiving a computed tomography scan only. Few appendectomies were performed open (2.6 percent), with a laparoscopic to open conversion rate of 0.5 percent. The majority of patients (87.3 percent) were discharged the day of or the day after their operation. Incidental tumors were identified in 1.1 percent of cases, with higher rates among older patients (2.7 percent among patients aged \u226565 years). The overall rate of a negative appendectomy was 3.8 percent, but it was higher (19.4 percent) for patients with no preoperative imaging. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.04 percent; for any complication and serious complications, the 30-day mortality rates were 3.0 and 2.2 percent, respectively.\n\"As surgeons contemplate the role of nonoperative therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis, the data presented here should be used to inform the ongoing debate,\" the authors write."}
{"idx": "19240", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Nasa's Cassini probe has found that the dunes on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan vary in shape just like dunes on Earth - and even look similar to deserts on our planet.\nThe similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300 feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand.\nThere are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns.\nAnalysis of images sent back by Nasa's orbiting Cassini probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on Earth.\nThe result gives new clues about the moon\u2019s climatic and geological history.\nDune fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the moon\u2019s peculiar environment.\nThough similar in shape to the linear dunes found on Earth in Namibia or the Arabian Peninsula, Titan\u2019s dunes are gigantic by our standards.\nThey are on average 0.6 to 1.2 mileswide, hundreds of miles long and around 300 feet (100 meters) high. However, their size and spacing vary across the surface, betraying the environment in which they have formed and evolved.\nUsing radar data from the Cassini spacecraft, Alice Le Gall, a former postdoctoral fellow at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and collaborators have discovered that the size of Titan\u2019s dunes is controlled by at least two factors: altitude and latitude.\nMore elevated dunes tend to be thinner and more widely separated.\nThe gaps between the dunes seem to appear to Cassini\u2019s radar, indicating a thinner covering of sand.\nThe sand needed to build the dunes seems to be mostly found in the lowlands of Titan.\nScientists think the sand on Titan is not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid hydrocarbons, precipitated out of the atmosphere.\nThese have then fiormed into grains 0.04 inch in size by a still unknown process.\nIn terms of latitude, the sand dunes on Titan are confined to its equatorial region, in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude. However, the dunes tend to be less voluminous toward the north. Le Gall and colleagues think that this may be due to Saturn\u2019s elliptical orbit.\nEach season on Titan lasts for about seven years. The slightly elliptical nature of Saturn\u2019s orbit means that the southern hemisphere of Titan has shorter but more intense summers. So the southern regions are probably drier, which implies they have less ground moisture.\nThe drier the sand grains, the more easily they can be transported by the winds to make dunes. 'As one goes to the north, we believe the soil moisture probably increases, making the sand particles less mobile and, as a consequence, the development of dunes more difficult,' says Le Gall.\nBacking this hypothesis is the fact that Titan\u2019s lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude. These reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind."}

But if you've about to lay out \u00a35.99 (or $9.95 in the US) what does the new software update actually bring you and is it worth the update? We downloaded the new update to find out.\nSo you now get the ability to download movies on your iPod touch to watch on the go as long as you've got a Wi-Fi connection to download them with. This, as you can imagine, is of course ideal if you are sitting on the sofa and are too lazy to turn on your computer at home or are around a friend's house. Before you start downloading the latest and greatest Hollywood has to offer, you should bear in mind that you are about to download a rather large file to your iPod. No problem as it's Wi-Fi, but not great if you are about to jump on a plane at the airport and you're running for the gate.\nGreat you can ditch those white Apple headphones and go completely wire free, which, let's face it, is perfect for running. While iPod touch 2nd generation users can, iPod touch 1st gen users can't. That's right, although Bluetooth was around when the first touch launched, Apple didn't include the technology, so if you're a first gen iPod touch user don't go out and buy that set of Bluetooth headphones just yet.\nThe 3.0 software update brings with it peer to peer game play in what some see as a direct attempt to take on the Nintendo DS. Although none are available at the time of writing, the newest games will allow you to play head-to-head with a friend whether its via Wi-Fi (ie on the otherside of the world) or next to each other. The downsides? Well there aren't any games out that let you do it just yet, and yep you guessed it, 1st gen iPod touch users miss out on this feature too.\nFlip your iPod touch on its side and you'll now get a landscape keyboard. The result, as you might expect, is more room to type and for those who like to type with their thumbs, an easier way to do it instead of jabbing away with a finger. The landscape keyboard isn't the only new landscape feature to be added though. You'll now be able to view stocks (oh the excitement) in landscape mode as well.\nA swipe to the left on the iPod touch homescreen gives you access to Spotlight search, which works in a similar way as the Palm Pre's search feature, allowing you to search the entire device. Typing something in doesn't just give you access to your music, but everything on your MP3 player. Type in \"Chris\", for example, and you'll get all your songs, apps, and emails with Chris in it appearing in a long list. Spotlight will even work to pick up words within words so \"Chris\" will also bring up your \"Christmas\" tracks as well.\nProbably the number one requested feature for iPhone and iPod touch users, Apple has finally added Cut, Copy & Paste to the OS. Pressing down on a word allows you to then copy and paste it to another application (you can do sentences too). It's handy for punching in addresses in maps or just generally grabbing content from a web page or email, however it's clear to see why Apple held back for so long.

BAI will take up to a month to decide whether an inspection is necessary, and up to six months to announce the result of its probe, though this can be extended if necessary.\n\u201cThe audit will not be limited to the athletes\u2019 village, but will be about the overall management of athletes,\u201d the ministry said at the briefing, adding it will not shirk responsibility.\nThe ministry is also considering involving the National Human Rights Commission of Korea in the investigation and installing an independent \u201csports ethics center\u201d that would specialize in investigating misconduct in the sports circle. A bill that would enable this body to be formed was proposed last week and is currently pending at the National Assembly.\nOther measures that will be taken include the employment of female trainers to check on the well-being of female athletes.\nHowever, the ministry\u2019s measures largely failed to hold the Korean Sports and Olympic Committee -- of which coach Cho Jae-gum, the alleged perpetrator in Shim\u2019s case, is a part -- responsible.\nIn Korea, national-level athletes competing in sports without a professional league usually live and train at the state-run athletes\u2019 village, under the management of coaching staff. Most professional athletes live in quarters run by their teams. Just last year, the Korean Basketball League decided to allow players to commute during home games.\nBeing confined to a living space under constant watch could make players more susceptible to influence from their coaching staff, particularly underage players.\nAt the professional level, a case of sexual violence involving a professional basketball player sparked nationwide outrage in 2007, resulting in a suspended prison term for the head coach.\nIn Shim\u2019s case, multiple instances of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the four years leading up to last year\u2019s PyeongChang Winter Games, which included a period when Shim was a minor.\nShim\u2019s father recently told the Korean media that KSOC chief Lee Kee-heung told Shim that he would \u201ctake care of the Cho case,\u201d and that he would bring him back \u201cwhen the dust settles.\u201d The KSOC denied that Lee had made the statement.\n\u201cThe status of KSOC is twofold: It is a national Olympic committee with ties to the International Olympic Committee, and also a state organization,\u201d said a ministry official, citing the IOC\u2019s regulation that restricts a state from unfairly influencing its national Olympic committee.\n\u201cThe situation concerning Lee should be handled as the regulation states, but we admit there are limits,\u201d he said, adding that the ministry is considering measures to deal with repeat offenses by KSOC officials, though he did not elaborate.\nThose in the sports circle have pointed out that KSOC\u2019s lukewarm response toward offenders exacerbates the problem.\nIn 2009, KSOC created a center for those in the sports circle to report sexual violence, in response to sexual abuse by the professional basketball coach.

No matter how safe the water is, some city residents won\u2019t be so quick to believe the government again. After all, the city has fudged water samples in the past. The state knew the water wasn\u2019t safe and let the city of nearly 100,000 use it anyway. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates public water at the federal level, concluded earlier this month that the Flint water crisis was, in large part, its fault.\nPerhaps residents shouldn\u2019t be so quick to trust, said Laura Sullivan, an engineering professor at Kettering University who sits on the Flint Water Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee.\n\u201cWhy in the world would anybody think that the agency that caused the problem could be trusted to actually fix it?\u201d Sullivan told Earther.\nShe said the state\u2019s new methods of water testing are a cause for concern. The methods are different from how the state tested water earlier this year, which found elevated lead levels in more than 4 percent of water samples in the school district. The state didn\u2019t take any action to find out where the lead was coming from either, Sullivan said. Her suspicion is that instead of solving the problem, the state figured out how to make the water appear fine.\n\u201cI do not understand why it is that the state of Michigan would go in and test and find lead in the school water and not do anything to see where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Sullivan went on.\nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality said to Earther via email that it\u2019s sampling the water coolers and bubblers because that\u2019s where students are most likely to drink water. Previous tests were meant to evaluate worst-case scenarios.\nBack then, the state was testing faucets in the classroom. Now it\u2019s testing water bubblers and coolers. By using these water bubblers and coolers as data points, the state is making the case against further testing or filtering the water pouring from the faucets. They\u2019ve gone ahead and classified these faucets as not \u201cintended points of use\u201d for drinking water with the Michigan Department of License and Regulatory affairs, so it appears unlikely they\u2019ll be monitoring these faucets any further, Sullivan said.\nThese latest tests involve flushing the water through the system before collecting samples. Studies have linked this process to reduced lead levels in water because it allows any water that\u2019s been sitting in the pipes to run, but this doesn\u2019t always keep lead levels safe throughout the school day when water may sit in pipes for hours.\nThe state sampled water in all 13 school buildings within the school district from June 6 to July 9 using these methods. All 420 samples registered at or below 15 parts per billion of lead, the federal action level. However, no amount of lead is safe for a child to drink, so the state was sure to note that more than 99 percent of the samples were at five parts per billion, the amount at which water companies are allowed to bottle water.\nThese results are good, which is why Sullivan is skeptical of them as is Gina Luster, a local organizer"}

The national war will become a religious war.\nNational conflicts are basically rational. They concern territory. They can usually be solved by compromise.\nReligious conflicts are irrational. Each side believes in an absolute truth, and automatically considers everybody else as infidels, enemies of the only true God.\nThere can be no compromise between True Believers, who believe that they are fighting for God and get their orders straight from Heaven. \"God Wills It\" shouted the Crusaders and butchered Muslims and Jews. \"Allah is the Greatest\" shout fanatical Muslims and behead their enemies. \"Who is like you among the Gods!\" cried the Maccabees, and annihilated all fellow Jews who had adopted Greek manners.\nThe Zionist movement was created by secularized Jews, after the victory of the European Enlightenment. Almost all the founders were convinced atheists. They were mostly quite ready to use religious symbols for decoration, but were roundly denounced by all the great religious sages of their time.\nIndeed, before the creation of the State of Israel, the Zionist enterprise was remarkably free of religious dogmas. Even today, extreme Zionists talk about the \"Nation State of the Jewish People\", not of the \"Religious State of the Jewish Faith\". Even for the \"national religious\" camp, the forerunners of today's settlers and semi-fascists, religion was subordinate to the national goal \u2013 the creation of a national Jewish state in all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.\nThis national onslaught met, of course, with the resolute resistance of the Arab national movement. After some initial hesitation, Arab national leaders turned against it. This resistance had very little to do with religion. True, for some time the Palestinian resistance was led by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini - not because of his religious standing but because he was the leader of Jerusalem's most aristocratic clan.\nThe Arab national movement was always decidedly secular. Some of its most outstanding leaders were Christians. The pan-Arab Baath (\"Resurrection\") party, which came to dominate both Syria and Iraq, was founded by Christians.\nThe great hero of the Arab masses at that time, Gamal Abd-al-Nasser, though formally Muslim, was quite un-religious. Yasser Arafat, the leader of the PLO, was a pious Muslim in private, but under his leadership the PLO remained a secular body with many Christian ingredients. He spoke about liberating East Jerusalem's \"mosques and churches\". For some time the official aim of the PLO was to create in Palestine a \"democratic and non-denominational\" state.\nSo what has happened? How did a nationalist movement turn into a violent, fanatical religious one?\nKaren Armstrong, the nun-turned-historian, pointed out that the same thing happened practically simultaneously in all three monotheistic religions. In the US, evangelical Christians now play a large role in politics, in close cooperation with the Jewish right-wing establishment. All over the Muslim world, fundamentalist movements are gaining strength. And in Israel, a messianic Jewish fundamentalism is now playing a larger and larger role.\nWhen the same thing happens in such diverse countries and religions, there must be a common cause.

This finding has provided new fuel for the long-running debate over the future of longevity, casting doubt on predictions that the U.S. life span is bound to keep climbing and emboldening naysayers who have long insisted that this isn\u2019t the case. At the heart of this question are Boomers, who now dominate the ranks of the middle-aged\u2014and whose health and income trends go a long way toward explaining both the numbers and the clashing perspectives surrounding them.\nSince 1969, death rates in the United States have fallen by about 43% as the mortality rates for leading ailments like stroke, heart disease, and cancer have declined dramatically. But from 2010 to 2013, the most recent period, death rates dropped by an average of just 0.4% annually\u2014a figure so low it is not considered statistically significant.\nThe slowdown has surprised researchers who expected to see steeper declines. In the words of Atlantic writer Gregg Easterbrook, gains in life expectancy at birth over time have resembled \u201can escalator rising smoothly\u201d\u2014and many observers assume that the ride will simply continue to age 100 and beyond. Until the mid-20th century, most of these increases were driven by improvements that cut infant and childhood mortality rates. But since World War II, elderly longevity has risen so rapidly that it has repeatedly exceeded the official projections from agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Census Bureau.\nWhile most optimists concede that longevity may have some ultimate genetic limit, they argue that this limit is considerably higher than once assumed. As evidence, they cite the fact that mortality rates of the oldest age brackets have shown just as much percentage improvement as the mortality rates among younger age brackets. Also, according to a paper published in the journal Science, these increases have occurred at an \u201cextraordinarily linear\u201d rate. Longevity has been increasing by about 2.5 years per decade\u2014or three months per year\u2014ever since the mid-19th century.\nWhat\u2019s more, some believe that this genetic limit could be pushed back or even breached altogether. In recent years, this kind of unfettered enthusiasm has fueled a wave of support for biotech firms working to develop age-defying drugs, cheered on by well-heeled scientists and researchers like Craig Venter and Aubrey de Grey.\nIndeed, the optimists haven\u2019t given up hope yet. Some caution that since the latest death rates figure only covers four years, it\u2019s too early to declare the beginning of a trend. Others point out that life expectancies in the United States obviously still have room for improvement because they continue to trail those in plenty of other developed countries, including Japan, France, and Germany.\nIt might seem like the new data favor the pessimists\u2019 case. But what is driving the recent slowdown may have little to do with the theoretical arguments of either camp. Rather, it may be due more to the changing behaviors of the generation now entering its higher-mortality years: Boomers. According to a 2013 study published in JAMA, they\u2019re more likely to suffer from a wide range of chronic diseases, including obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension; have higher rates of disability; and are less likely to rate their own health positively"}

He announced his decision on national TV, to the shock of family and friends, many of whom had crowded into the gym at Macon County High dressed in red and black. But then he recanted, committing instead to Georgia \u2014 the departure of UCLA linebackers coach Jeff Ulbrich to the NFL played a role \u2014 and opting to completely forgo signing a National Letter of Intent.\nAt the time, Smith\u2019s decision to skip out on the holy grail of signing day sparked a rash of speculation that this might be the new norm in college football. It\u2019s not. Most players still pledge their allegiance to one school with their signature on a dotted line.\nAs for Smith, well, it turned out just fine.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why he feels that.\nSmith leads his team with 113 total tackles, including 10.5 tackles for loss. He\u2019ll probably be a first-round NFL pick in May (he sidestepped a question Friday about draft grades). He won the Butkus award, presented annually to the top linebacker in college football; he\u2019s the first UGA player to earn the honor. He was named the SEC defensive player of the year and a unanimous All-American, and was a finalist for both national defensive player of the year awards.\nThis, according to his teammates, is due mostly to two qualities: blazing speed, and an outstanding football IQ.\nGeorgia safety J.R. Reed said Smith studies so much film, he can often diagnose a play before the offense is even done calling it. Smith will often beat Reed to the ball partially because he\u2019s closer and faster but, more often than not Reed admits, because he knows what\u2019s going to happen before anyone else.\nLinebacker Lorenzo Carter joked that Smith reacts so quickly and gets ballcarriers to the ground so fast, it doesn\u2019t give other guys a chance to learn anything. Carter\u2019s favorite Smith highlight this season was when he ran down Notre Dame\u2019s Brandon Wimbush from behind, taking the quarterback to the ground before he could pile up any yardage in Georgia\u2019s 20-19 road win.\nSmith said he is always \u201cseeking knowledge:\u201d About other teams\u2019 offensive tendencies, about different foods to eat, about cultures he wants to visit.\nWhile his teammates praised his productivity and natural athleticism Friday, Smith seemed more interested in talking about different trips he\u2019s taken around the world than talking about how he plans to contain Oklahoma quarterback and Heisman winner Baker Mayfield.\nBut higher on his list would be a trip to Atlanta, home of the 2018 national championship.\nIt\u2019s a long way from UCLA\u2019s home field \u2014 and exactly where he wants to be."}

The Saints goalkeeper tipped a Lukaku shot around the post, did well to react to a cheeky attempt from distance by Andreas Pereira, and then saved at close range from Lukaku again when the striker should have scored.\nAfter surviving that initial onslaught Southampton began to push their opponents back and grow into the game, gradually asserting authority over a fairly callow United midfield. They could have taken the lead after 12 minutes when Jannik Vestergaard climbed unchallenged to meet a James Ward-Prowse corner and headed wastefully over the bar, and might have had a penalty when Chris Smalling got away with a blatant tug on Ryan Bertrand's shirt. The referee waved play on immediately, perhaps unconvinced by Bertrand's theatrical fall, but there was no question that the United defender had pulled him back.\nIn an effort to break the Southampton press, Pogba made a length-of-the-field break up the left, helped by Lukaku on halfway, but held on to the ball a fraction too long for his intended target Marcus Rashford to stay onside.\nPogba was possibly at fault, however, when Southampton took the lead a few minutes later; at least there was no-one in his position on the left side of midfield when Charlie Austin found Valery in miles of space. Taking advantage of Luke Shaw backing off with his hands behind his back, the Southampton wing-back advanced a couple of paces before unleashing a ferocious shot that beat David de Gea from a good five yards outside the area.\nThe goalkeeper managed to get hands to the ball but still could not keep it out, only succeeding in pushing it into his top left corner. It was the 20-year-old's first goal in English football and he is unlikely to score a better one.\nAt that point Southampton deserved to be in the lead, and though United applied pressure, with Pereira in particular sending in some inviting crosses, the visitors managed to stay in front until the interval. Smalling was close with a header, Gunn had to make a save at the feet of Alexis Sanchez, but Southampton were playing with great confidence and the half ended with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg shooting straight at De Gea.\nWhen the already ineffective Sanchez departed injured five minutes in to the second half it appeared United might be struggling for an attacking replacement when full-back Diogo Dalot took his place. The opposite proved to be the case. With his first touch of the afternoon Dalot produced a cross to the far post from which Rashford should have hit the target, and with his second he teed up Pereira for the game's second goal"}
{"idx": "19258", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: EVANSTON, Ill. \u2014 When you are hit with the flu, you know it immediately \u2014 fever, chills, sore throat, aching muscles, fatigue. This is your body mounting an immune response to the invading virus. But less is known about what is happening on the molecular level.\nNow Northwestern University scientists have discovered one of the ways the influenza virus disarms our natural defense system. The virus decreases the production of key immune system-regulating proteins in human cells that help fight the invader. The virus does this by turning on the microRNAs \u2014 little snippets of RNA \u2014 that regulate these proteins.\nThe researchers, led by molecular biologist Curt M. Horvath, are among the first to show the influenza virus can change the expression of microRNA to control immune responses in human lung cells.\nThe findings reveal a new aspect of the interaction between the influenza virus and its host. Knowing how viruses disable the immune system to wreak havoc in the body will help researchers design therapeutics to preserve the immune response and keep people healthy. The knowledge also may be valuable for future diagnostics.\nThe study is published by the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The paper will appear in its final form in September.\nHorvath is the Soretta and Henry Shapiro Research Professor in Molecular Biology and professor of molecular biosciences in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is professor of microbiology-immunology and medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine.\nA microRNA has only 17 to 24 nucleotides, and its function is to dampen or shut down the production of proteins in the body. (Proteins are the workhorses of the cell.) There are hundreds of different types of microRNAs in animals.\nIt\u2019s been known for many years that when a virus such as influenza infects respiratory cells there is an immediate antiviral response at the cellular level \u2014 the first barrier for protecting the body from the virus. Most of the changes that occur are a result of antiviral gene expression.\nAbout 10 years ago, scientists first learned about small RNA pathways called microRNAs, which regulate gene expression. This led Horvath to want to investigate the role of microRNAs in influenza virus infection and determine what they are contributing to the antiviral response. Exactly which genes might the microRNAs be targeting?\nIn their current study, Horvath and his team used human lung cells, infected them with the influenza A virus and looked to see which microRNAs were activated in response to the virus. They focused on six microRNAs that were found to increase in abundance during flu infection.\nThe researchers found the virus activated two microRNAs that turned on the genes IRAK1 and MAPK3. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of proteins that help turn on the immune response.\nEssentially, the virus uses the cell mechanisms to its advantage, disarming parts of the natural antiviral system. The flu takes over the expression of microRNAs for its own purposes. The flu increases the expression of microRNA, which decreases the amount of protein and diminishes the immune response.\nHaving identified a specific set of microRNAs whose expression in host respiratory cells is changed by the influenza virus, Horvath next is interested at looking at the clinical outcomes. He is working with Pedro C. Avila, M.D., professor of medicine-allergy-immunology at the Feinberg School to see if the microRNAs are dis"}

{"idx": "19261", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A key MTA official wants to bring the Long Island Rail Road to a redeveloped Nassau Coliseum using nearby tracks that haven't been used to transport rail passengers in more than 50 years.\nNew LIRR president Patrick Nowakowski said MTA board member Mitchell Pally's plan to bring passenger trains near the Coliseum using the little-known Garden City-Mitchel Field Secondary line is feasible. However, a recent study commissioned by Nassau County, which owns the property, rules out the proposal as \"fatally flawed.\"\n\"We can get a track close to there. We can build a station close to there,\" Nowakowski said last week. \"The challenge is, would anybody use it?\"\nPally first publicly proposed creating the transit link during a meeting last month of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board's LIRR Committee, which he chairs. Pally said he had a preliminary discussion with representatives from the Coliseum's new developer, Forest City Ratner, and from the county to urge them to consider the idea.\nUnder the proposal, the LIRR would run trains along a 3-mile spur that branches off the Hempstead line and runs parallel to Stewart Avenue in Garden City.\nThe line -- a 19th-century vestige of the old Central Railroad of Long Island that later was absorbed by the LIRR -- served the Mitchel Field air base during World War II and other stations until the LIRR discontinued passenger service on it in 1953. And when plans for development of a \"Nassau Hub\" that included the Coliseum were floated in the late 1990s and during the administration of County Executive Thomas Suozzi, the line was mentioned as a possible connector in the transit visions for that area.\nToday, it continues to be used largely for storage and -- once a year -- by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus to bring its animals to the Coliseum, which is just south of the tracks.\nPally, explaining his rationale, drew comparisons with the LIRR's service to Citi Field for Mets games and New Jersey Transit's service to MetLife Stadium for NFL games. Similarly, he said, when the Nassau Coliseum hosts events, the LIRR could run shuttle trains between the venue and Hempstead, where customers could transfer for points west. To catch the shuttle, passengers could walk to the proposed station from the Coliseum, Pally said.\nPally, of Stony Brook, who represents Suffolk County on the MTA board, acknowledged that the service would not be a good option for Long Islanders east of the Coliseum because customers on most other lines would have to travel west to Jamaica to come back east on the Hempstead branch.\nHe noted, however, that the Coliseum remains the only major sports and entertainment venue in the region inaccessible by train. The LIRR's Atlantic Terminal is across the street from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn -- also a Ratner property -- and new rail stations opened in recent years both at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey.\n\"Unfortunately, the only entities that get to the Coliseum by train at the moment are the elephants,\" Pally told the committee. \"To me, that is not only unfortunate, but a significant anomaly in our mass transit system.\"\nNowakowski, while not taking a stance for or against the idea, said that logistically Pally's plan could work.

{"idx": "19268", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In last week\u2019s post, I argued that, aside from rationing ever-more health care through price and ability to pay, the structure of the health care system and our political process make it difficult, if not impossible, to lower the differential between the annual growth rates of national health spending and gross domestic product. We are thus destined to devote an ever-larger fraction of our G.D.P. to health care.\nOther researchers have concluded that \u201cit is hard to find any evidence that increased tort costs have harmed the U.S. economy\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence to justify such charges is remarkably weak and exaggerated.\u201d One study, by W. Kip Viscusi and Michael J. Moore, concluded that the tort system actually increased research and development and product innovation.\nNot surprisingly, the debate over the malpractice system mirrors these arguments. Much of that debate rests on anecdotal evidence and complaints by physicians that may have intuitive appeal but lack rigorous empirical support. In general I have found it unproductive to engage in debates based on such anecdotes.\n1. What is the total gross social cost of the system to society, including its non-monetary costs (e.g., the demoralization of physicians or the impairment of the physician-patient relationship)?\n2. What effect would a particular change to our malpractice system have on these costs?\n3. What impact does the malpractice system have on total annual national health spending (which, of course, excludes the non-monetary costs)?\n4. What effect would a particular change to our malpractice system have on that total spending?\n5. What are the net social benefits (or net social costs) associated with the system, after consideration of the social benefits the system yields \u2013 e.g., the fact that injured patients are compensated, an incentive to reduce avoidable medical error?\n6. What effect would a particular change to the system have on net social benefits or costs?\nFormal economic studies addressed to the fifth or sixth question are rare. Studies addressed to the first and second question also are rare, mainly because it is difficult to put monetary values on non-monetary phenomena.\nMost formal studies concentrate on the third or fourth question. Not surprisingly for empirical work of this sort, they yield a range of estimates among which one can pick and choose. While each such study can be questioned on methodological grounds, in their totality they convey a picture that was ably summarized in the latest survey of such studies by Michelle O. Mello and colleagues.\nIt may be illuminating to reproduce in detail the components of the authors\u2019 estimate of the total cost of malpractice (in billions of 2008 dollars). The magnitude of each line item is developed from estimates available in the literature.\nIt may seem strange that anyone would consider $55 billion, or 2.4 percent of 2008 national health spending, modest. But no one would suggest that any malpractice changes currently being considered would eliminate the entire $55 billion cost of the system.\nThus, it is reasonable to argue that the costs of the malpractice system are nontrivial, yet the expected reduction in overall health spending from changes to the malpractice system appears to be rather modest. Other recent studies have reached similar conclusions.\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a letter to Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah dated Oct. 9, 2009, advised that, according to its latest estimates, the package of malpractice changes now being proposed \u201cwould reduce total national health spending by about 0.5 percent ($"}

The agency was forced to de-certify and revise the document last year because of a court order prompted by a lawsuit from Menlo Park, Atherton and a coalition of nonprofit groups.\nThe new document includes revisions to sections dealing with project description, vibration impacts and Union Pacific's opposition to sharing its corridor with the new high-speed-rail system. But it does nothing to dispel the concerns voiced by Palo Alto and other Peninsula cities about the ridership projections in the document.\nStuart Flashman, the attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the rail authority, said the coalition was disappointed in the revised document, which he said \"raises more questions than it answers.\" The new document, for instance, does nothing to address widespread criticism of the rail authority's ridership projections. The rail authority used these projections to justify its selection of the Pacheco Pass in the Peninsula as the preferred alternative for the rail line, as opposed to the Altamont Pass in the East Bay, which the plaintiffs supported.\nIn June, the Institute of Transportation Studies at U.C. Berkeley found these projections to be flawed and unreliable, echoing earlier concerns from the the Palo Alto-based group Californians Advocating Responsible Rail Design (CARRD).\nPalo Alto, which had filed a motion supporting Menlo Park and Atherton's suit, also asked the rail authority to take a fresh look at its ridership projections, a request that the new document doesn't address.\nFlashman told the board of directors that by failing to reconsider the ridership numbers, the rail authority is opening itself up to fresh litigation.\n\"If you go ahead and certify this, you'll be ending up in court again and probably facing another adverse decision, which I think will be bad for the project,\" Flashman said.\nAtherton Councilman Jerry Carlsen echoed Flashman's sentiments and urged the rail authority not to certify the new document, which he predicted \"would further deepen the distrust of the authority.\"\n\"This will certainly be an area of further litigation if the document is approved as is,\" Carlsen said.\nPalo Alto officials, meanwhile, submitted a letter to the rail authority stating that the new document fails to address the city's comments. Rob Braulik, the city's project manager for high-speed rail, asked the board not to certify the environmental document and to reanalyze the possibility of running the rail line along Altamont Pass.\nDespite these concerns, the rail authority board of directors voted Thursday morning (in the second part of a two-day meeting) to certify the environmental document. In a statement, the rail authority said it responded to more than 3,700 comments from more than 500 agencies in the new EIR.\nCurt Pringle, chairman of the rail authority's board of directors, called the board's decision to certify the document \"another major step forward in making California the home of the nation's first high-speed rail network.\"\n\"Californians want this project done right, and that means a careful and thoughtful assessment of how"}

Emergency shelters provide homeless individuals a temporary place to sleep. As a community, however, our goal must be to move people quickly from the streets to temporary facilities and into housing where they can get a fresh start and the services they need.\nA recent initiative gives us hope. From April through June, the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance, The Bridge, the Salvation Army and Austin Street Center challenged one another \u2014 and themselves \u2014 to find homes for as many people in their emergency shelters as possible. They rallied everyone in their organizations, including people whose jobs don't directly include finding housing.\nThe goal was to house 90 people in 90 days. The shelters found permanent housing for 219.\nThe shelters say they can't sustain that level of intervention with existing resources. But how can you not be thrilled to see the payoff from such a beefed-up effort? Those who left the shelters have a better chance of progressing to a productive, independent life. And their progress opens up a spot for someone now on the streets.\nThat's why resources and commitment are so important. An annual census of Dallas' homeless population conducted this year found more than 1,000 people on Dallas streets, a 24 percent increase from 2017. The good news is that the city is about to add its muscle to the fight.\nPublic outreach meetings will kick off at recreation and community centers to discuss homelessness and possible solutions. Next month, the city plans to use $20 million in bond money to entice developers to provide permanent supportive housing for the homeless, the first step of a five-year target to add 1,000 units. The city manager's upcoming budget also is expected to include money for new short-term shelter locations as well as enhanced case management, transportation, medical and other services, some in conjunction with the faith community.\nA great city like Dallas becomes greater when it pulls together to reduce poverty and homelessness. Nationally, studies show that it is cheaper to find homes for the homeless than to let them languish on the streets.

The sports medicine organization stressed that these drinks aren\u2019t safe for children and shouldn\u2019t be marketed in a way that appeals to youth.\n\u201cEnergy drinks are extremely popular and concerns about their consumption are coming from every sector of society, which is why we\u2019ve published these recommendations,\u201d said Dr. John Higgins, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School in Houston.\nChildren are at an especially high risk of experiencing complications from drinks with high levels of caffeine and sugar because of their smaller body size and potentially rapid and excessive consumption, according to the statement.\n\u201cThe message that these beverages are not intended for children needs to be reinforced and widely disseminated,\u201d the group said.\n\u201cOur review of the available science showed that excessive levels of caffeine found in energy drinks can have adverse effects on cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal and endocrine systems, as well as psychiatric symptoms,\u201d Higgins said.\nThe group says more needs to be done to protect children and adolescents, as well as adults with heart or other medical conditions, from the potential adverse health effects of energy drinks.\nThe ACSM says there is a need for energy drink education among consumers, parents, physicians, athletic trainers, personal trainers, and coaches.\nThe organization asserts that many consumers don\u2019t recognize the difference between energy drinks and sports drinks, which may prevent them from making an informed decision about whether or not they or their children should consume them.\n\u201cEnergy drinks are highly caffeinated beverages that often contain a myriad of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbal mixtures,\u201d the group explained. Sports drinks contain carbohydrates, minerals, electrolytes and flavoring and are intended to replace water and electrolytes lost through sweating during exercise.\nIn its newly published guidelines, the ACSM says energy drinks should not be consumed before, during, or after intense exercise, noting that deaths linked with energy drinks have occurred when a person consumed energy drinks before and/or after vigorous activity.\nAdverse effects related to large amounts of caffeine include dangerous heart arrhythmias, increased blood pressure, anxiety, headache, insomnia, and nausea.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents aged 12 to 18 years should not exceed 100 mg of caffeine a day, which is the amount of caffeine in one cup of coffee.\nThe full statement has been published in online in the journal Current Sports Medicine Reports.\nAre energy drinks a source of heart trouble?"}

All rights reserved.\nThirteen human rights defenders were detained in Turkey on November 16 and Yi\u011fit Aksako\u011flu, an activist working on children rights, was imprisoned related to charges against Anadolu K\u00fclt\u00fcr, a cultural association founded by philanthropist Osman Kavala. Kavala himself has been in prison for more than a year without an indictment. This is not the first time human rights defenders and civil society representatives have been put behind bars in Turkey. This time, however, political violence has reached new heights; even peaceful resistance and civil disobedience are now criminalised by the security forces.\nSelective targeting of activists and pre-trial detentions are pernicious strategies to restrict civic space. Turkey is not alone in this practice. In recent years, human rights defenders suffer from unprecedented psychological, economic and social harm worldwide. If they refuse to back down, they also suffer physical harm. According to Frontline Defenders, 300 activists were murdered last year. Physical attacks, killings and forced disappearances mainly target rights-defenders demanding environmental protection and labour rights or activist journalists revealing corruption and abuse of power.\nThis is not random violence. I have become convinced that the incidents in question are not isolated acts but concerted attacks against those who try to embody the ideal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWhile most of the political violence takes place in consolidated long-term authoritarian systems, it is a part of a global trend of the worldwide rise of right-wing populism and democratic decline. The trend also affects human rights defence and civil society in Europe. But researchers and experts who work on the rise of populism and democratic decline do not talk about it sufficiently.\nIt might come as a surprise that civic space is not immune from direct and indirect political violence in Europe and the US. CIVICUS consider that civil society in the United States, France, UK, Spain and Austria has \u2018narrowed\u2019 largely due to the rise in support for extremist and far-right political views and extreme security measures and anti-terrorism laws.\nSeveral new European democracies often use legislative power, i.e. restrictions on foreign funding or security and anti-terrorism laws, and politicised judiciary to discourage or even criminalise rights-based activism concerning issues directly related to political, social and economic rights of \u2018out-groups\u2019 such as minorities, migrants and refugees.\nThe gravity of the situation varies; restrictions are qualitatively different in democracies of western Europe from those in the semi-authoritarian regimes for example in Hungary, Turkey and Poland, and the intensity of political violence is much less in a semi-authoritarian regime than a consolidated autocracy like China. Yet, the global trend affects all types of governments, and core treaties that burden states to protect fundamental political and civil rights are being undermined by even the long-term advocates of these treaties.\nThe assault against civic space and human rights defenders has been high on the agenda of human rights organisations for at least a decade. They have been seeking ways to adapt to political violence and reopen the closed spaces in several countries.\nHowever, academics and international donors have started to consider targeted political violence as an integral part of the global democratic decline and populist politics only lately. The institutional dimensions of democratic decline and populist political discourse still receive disproportionate attention.\nResearchers have invested a great deal in agreeing on what populism means and whether certain parties are populist or not, and analysing populists\u2019 electoral success, manifest"}

Over its 80 years of operation, until it was closed in 1992, this was a bleak spot in the beautiful city. Among its detainees were Jews during the Fascist period. But two months ago, Ferrara saw a key step in the profound transformation of this location: On Dec. 13, 2017, the first day of Hanukkah, Italy\u2019s National Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah opened in the old prison. This is the initial phase of a monumental project\u2014known as MEIS, after its initials in Italian\u2014to be completed in 2020, with additional buildings that will create a major Jewish cultural hub.\nThe inaugural event was standing room only, bustling with news camera crews, international journalists, Ferrara residents, and Italian dignitaries, including President Sergio Mattarella. Curators and staff were ceremoniously thanked and acknowledged for their collaborative work to finally bring MEIS to the public. And the mission of MEIS is ambitious: to raise awareness of the vibrant 2,200 years of Italian Judaism, promoting dialogues on the topics of minorities, and of how different cultures interact through history.\nThe dream began in 2003 with an Act of Parliament, where all parties unanimously voted to support the initiative. What began as a plan for a Holocaust museum expanded in 2006 to a bigger project: to establish a museum to tell the story of two millennia of the Jewish experience in Italy. \u201cThe fact that this is a national project is what makes this museum unique in the world,\u201d said MEIS Director Simonetta Della Seta. And unlike smaller, locally funded Jewish museums in Italy, this one is entirely funded, to the tune of 47 million euros, by the Italian government.\nIn 2011, Studio Arco of Bologna and SCAPE Sp.A Rome won an international competition to design the project. The team, comprising Italian, Japanese, and American architects, created a plan to retain and renovate two of the original Ferrara prison buildings, and to regenerate the property, opening it up in a light-filled, contemporary style to blend with the city.\nConstruction of five modern buildings, inspired by the five books of the Torah, will begin this year. These buildings will complete the cultural complex of free public spaces, an auditorium, museum shop, library, archives, educational suites, gardens, and restaurants. Work on the grounds was ongoing during the December opening, adding an energetic pulse, and a model of the completed project was displayed.\nThe museum\u2019s current offerings comprise two parts. First a 24-minute immersive video, \u201cThrough the Eyes of the Italian Jews,\u201d which takes viewers time-traveling through the entire history of Italian Judaism, using different narrative voices to personalize key experiences\u2014from a Jewish man deported to Rome after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple to a scribe in the middle ages and a young girl expelled from school in 1938 because of racial laws. The video defines the MEIS vision: to tell the complicated story of the Jewish experience in Italy, which includes painful periods as well as times of peace and collaboration.

Luke Kennard, Jayson Tatum, Grayson Allen and Frank Jackson combined for 77 points Friday and 75 of Duke\u2019s 81 on Thursday, the grand plan finally coming to fruition.\nThere will be many sweeping conclusions drawn from this game, which is merely the nature of such a high-profile game with such dramatic shifts of momentum and fortune. Harry Giles will be anointed as Duke\u2019s savior. North Carolina\u2019s mental toughness will be questioned. Roy Williams\u2019 philosophy on timeouts will be debated (yet again). And on and on.\nThe reality is that this was an odd game, one unavoidably affected (for both teams) by some erratic and touchy officiating, and by Joel Berry\u2019s quick third and fourth fouls and subsequent 10-minute exile on the bench, at which point the game, momentum and crowd swung in Duke\u2019s favor as an eight-point North Carolina lead became a seven-point Duke lead.\nThe Tar Heels will be fine. Williams\u2019 two national champions at North Carolina both exited the ACC tournament early, and while this team doesn\u2019t have the injury problems the 2009 team had, Williams said Kennedy Meeks has been dealing with a knee problem, which may help explain why he went from unstoppable in the first half to invisible in the second.\nUniversity of North Carolina basketball coach Roy Williams talks about not calling time out, and being angry with his team for its performance in their loss to Duke in the ACC Tournament.\nThe one conclusion that can unerringly be drawn is that Kennard, Tatum, Allen and Jackson are finally sharing the ball instead of fighting over it, and whatever chemistry problems plagued the Blue Devils appear to have been solved.\nThose four never seemed to be firing at the same time. Tatum was hurt to start the season and struggled to find his place in the offense. Allen has been in and out with injuries both physical and mental, but seems comfortable again coming off the bench. Jackson helped keep Duke afloat early, then faded to the background as the others returned to prominence, but has regained his footing at this late point in the season.\nDuke arrived in Brooklyn still searching for its identity, but this is it, this four-headed perimeter monster. This was it all along. It was never a question of figuring it out. It was just a question of whether it would click.\nThrow Giles into the mix, and Duke is really dangerous, but it\u2019s hard to say whether this is the beginning of a trend of a one-time summoning of the inner reserves of talent Giles has always possessed but has been unable to draw upon because of his injuries. Even now, his legs lack the elastic athleticism that made him such a coveted recruit in high school, but he shows flashes.\nThis was the brightest flash yet, blocking shots and dunking and giving Duke the inside presence it lacked in the first half when North Carolina got easy basket after easy basket. The Blue Devils, using the short bench Krzyzewski always prefers, do not appear from the outside to have the depth necessary to become the first ACC team to win four games in four days. Giles may be the wild card. Or he may not.\nEither way, Duke is on the verge of winning its first ACC title since 2011, a championship achieved with a win over North Carolina in their last tournament meeting.

Hayworth, now in his sixth term in Congress, in an interview with National Review Online Editor Kathryn Lopez. Hayworth is the author of Whatever It Takes: Illegal Immigration, Border Security, and the War on Terror, written with Joseph Eule.\nKathryn Jean Lopez: How bad is illegal immigration in Arizona?\nCongressman J. D. Hayworth: It could not be much worse. Every night thousands of illegal aliens cross into Arizona. Most simply use it as a transportation hub, but many also stay to the detriment of our state. It costs Arizona about $750 million to educate the children of illegal immigrants and $400 million for nonreimbursed medical care. And then there is the crime and all the other social problems associated with illegal immigration. In fact, the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates that illegal immigration costs each Arizonan almost $700 a year\u2013a hidden tax that subsidizes illegal aliens and those who hire them.\nThe border in Arizona is not only an environmental wasteland, but also a veritable war zone. Most people along the border are armed. The violence is staggering. In one particularly brutal instance, rival gangs of human smugglers had a rolling shoot-out along Interstate 10 in southern Arizona. Parents don\u2019t let their children play in the yard unless they are with them\u2026and armed. Dogs are routinely poisoned. Certain roads are too dangerous to drive on after dark. Illegals crossing the Barry Goldwater bombing range have interrupted training and in 2004 caused the loss of more than 50 training days. At the Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Reservation, tribal leaders estimate illegal border crossers leave behind six tons of trash a day, not to mention the tons of marijuana that have been seized.\nI could go on and on. People in Arizona are truly at the breaking point. It is not just the biggest issue in the state; at this point it is the only issue.\nLopez: Whose fault is it that the Border Patrol appears to be AWOL?\nCongressman Hayworth: It\u2019s not the Border Patrol that is AWOL, the politicians are. The Border Patrol is actually doing a tremendous job against incredible odds. Not only is the Border Patrol underfunded, understaffed, outmanned, and outgunned, but the rest of the federal government actually works to make its job harder by actually making it easier for illegals to settle into American life. I cite several examples of that in the book.\nThat is why one of the steps I advocate is a temporary deployment of troops to the border to establish operational control. As I say in the book: Our goal should be to put the \u201cbored\u201d back in Border Patrol; but first we have to put the \u201corder\u201d back in border.\nLopez: If immigration is such a security issue why hasn\u2019t a nightmare scenario happened already?\nCongressman Hayworth: I\u2019d say we have already had a nightmare scenario. Could 9/11 have happened without lax immigration laws and lax enforcement of those laws? Probably not.\nBut more to the point, I think you would be hard pressed to find a single Arizonan living along the border who would not say they are living a nightmare scenario. Granted, there hasn\u2019t been a single devastating event since 9/11, but the cumulative effect of unrestricted illegal immigration has been"}
{"idx": "19298", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Baltimore Orioles pitcher Miguel Castro during the first inning of a spring training baseball game against the Toronto Blue Jays Friday, March 9, 2018, in Dunedin, Fla.\nThe last time Miguel Castro's baseball career made any sense, at least from a linear player development standpoint, it came at the same park he began his 2018 Orioles rotation audition in Friday\u2019s 8-5 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays \u2014 Dunedin Stadium.\nBefore he was anointed the Blue Jays' 20-year-old closer in 2015, before that experiment failed and led to him being traded to the Colorado Rockies, and before the Orioles brought him in as a reclamation project last April, there were two weeks spent with the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays.\nIt was the end of a breakout season, when Castro, then 19, pitched his way up two levels from short-season ball in barely over two months. He did it as a starting pitcher, and though he came back tp Dunedin the following season on a rehabilitation assignment, Castro had already been knocked off the fast track.\nThat he formally began to state his case for a rotation spot after two seasons of struggles and one of success \u2014 last year as the Orioles' long reliever \u2014 back at that same ballpark excited Castro, and he left after three innings feeling like it was a worthy return.\n\"I felt very good today,\" Castro said through Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez, the club's pitching instructor. \"My knee was good \u2014 it didn't bother me any, and that meant that everything started the right way. ... I'm going to be competing every time, every time I go out there, trying to do my best and see what happens.\"\nCastro, whose Grapefruit League debut was delayed by patellar tendinitis in his knees, had a day that mirrored that of pretty much every one of the contenders for the Orioles' fifth starter spot this spring, including Mike Wright Jr., Nestor Cortes Jr. and Gabriel Ynoa \u2014 he didn't dominate, but he didn't necessarily disqualify himself either.\nHe allowed a run on two hits with a pair of walks and a strikeout, leaving with the score tied at 1 before the Blue Jays started to hit around the Orioles bullpen. The Orioles fell to the Blue Jays, bringing their Grapefruit League record to 6-8-1.\nIn the first inning, with his fastball up to 97 mph on the stadium radar gun, Castro worked low in the zone but left a 2-2 fastball over the plate to veteran left fielder Curtis Granderson and watched it bounce off the left-center-field wall. Two batters later, third baseman Josh Donaldson stung a single through the left side to score him. A double play got Castro out of the inning, and three more groundouts made for a clean second inning.\nAfter only being able to locate his fastball for strikes in the first inning, he began to throw useful changeups and sliders in the second, and was mixing all three in by the third inning. He opened his final inning by striking out center fielder Kevin Pillar looking on a slider, then walked a pair before getting two flyouts to escape unscathed.\nWhile he held his fastball velocity through the 49-pitch outing, he said his slider \"was a little bit inconsistent,\" but his changeup was \"very,"}
{"idx": "19299", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Thanks to the AFA breaking the story and cranking up the heat on the U.S. military, the Pentagon is now scrambling to unblock the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) website on military computers.\nThe reason given by the military's IT unit for the original blockage is that the SBC website contained \"hostile content.\" The Pentagon has since claimed the blockage was due to the detection of malware on the SBC website. This may be so.\nPentagon officials have stumbled all over themselves trying to deflect the accusation that the occlusion represented an expression of anti-Christian bias.\nAccording to the Pentagon's own definition of cyberwar, the DOD may in fact have been accusing the SBC of being a domestic terror threat. My search of the term \"hostile content\" and \"malware\" yielded nothing but one obscure reference, in a veterinary journal of all places.\nBut a search of the term \"hostile content\" and \"malware\" took me to a website that contains the DOD definitions for all sorts of malicious activity in cyberspace.\nAll this brouhaha could have been avoided had the CONUS team simply said the site had been blocked due to \"malware.\" But it didn't. It used the term \"hostile content.\"\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the definition of \"hostile\" is \"of or relating to an enemy.\" So the most straightforward understanding of the phrase is that the DOD was accusing the SBC of having \"content\" that was generated by or associated with the DOD's enemies. Well, the DOD's enemies are America's enemies. It's pretty easy to do the math here.\nThe DOD's \"cyberspace glossary\", where we ought to find clarity on this matter, does not even have an entry for \"hostile content.\" If the DOD wants to avoid confusion in the future, perhaps they had better add a definition forthwith.\nIn the current cyberspace glossary, the word \"hostile\" is used just twice, once in reference to a \"hostile act\" and the other in reference to \"hostile intent.\"\nNow to be sure, the DOD did not use the phrase \"hostile intent.\" It used the phrase \"hostile content,\" which \u2013 and I'm open for more information here \u2013 is rarely if ever used in cybertalk. I talked last evening with an IT specialist who has spent 30 years protecting computer systems from viruses and such, and he has never even heard the term \"hostile content.\"\nThe more common term is \"malware,\" which is a combination of the terms \"malicious\" and \"software.\" But if that's what the military was talking about, why didn't it say so?\nSo the most charitable explanation we can come to, using the DOD's own terminology, is that the \"content\" of the SBC website represented an \"immediate\" threat to the security of the DOD and hence the American people. You will notice that mere \"capability\" qualifies for \"hostile intent\" designation.\nThis wouldn't be a concern were it not for the disturbing pattern of hostile, anti-Christian behavior from the military. Just recently, an Army officer classified AFA and FRC as \"domestic hate groups\" in an official military communication. Training presentations in the recent past labeled evangelical Christians and Roman Catholics as domestic terror threats, right alongside Al Qaeda.\nFranklin Graham was banned from the Pentagon for telling the truth about Islam. Christian prayers were forbidden at veteran cemeteries. B"}

In a fertile man, at least 25 per cent of sperm cells should be 'rapidly progressive' \u0096 moving fast enough and in the right direction to reach the egg.\nPoor motility is a sign of sperm DNA damage, or fragmentation, caused by highly reactive substances called free radicals.\nSome DNA fragmentation is fairly common, says Clark, but at higher rates it begins to affect fertility.\n\"If more than 20 per cent of the sperm have got evidence of DNA damage, then that couple's chances of getting pregnant is significantly reduced and the risk of miscarriage is three to four times higher,\" she says. Genetic problems can also be passed on to children.\nWhile diet is not the only factor influencing DNA fragmentation \u0096 a man's age is another \u0096 it is an important one. Fifty three per cent of men visiting Clark's clinic have at least one form of nutritional deficiency that impacts on sperm function and fertility potential.\nClark says everyone who is trying to conceive should think about diet, not just those people who are having difficulty.\nFoods such as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains are important because they are rich in antioxidants, which inhibit the free radicals that can damage sperm DNA.\nBut it's not so much about eating specific foods as having a healthy diet overall.\nLots of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins C and E, and zinc and selenium are needed for healthy sperm.\n\"Having the right nutrient mix is important. If you have a normal balanced diet you'll be getting all the important nutrients.\"\nBut there are occasions when a healthy diet isn't enough.\nOne in eight people have an enzyme variant called MTHFR that means they have difficulties absorbing the vitamin folate from their diet, however healthy it is.\nDeficiencies in folate, along with low levels of vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, are linked with DNA damage in sperm through raised levels of a chemical called homocysteine (a building block for proteins).\nBut if a man is unable to absorb folate from foods such as green leafy vegetables , a supplement will do the job.\nClark says a good quality multivitamin supplement will provide adequate folate and two months is often enough to reverse sperm DNA fragmentation.\nTo optimise fertility generally with a supplement, choose one that includes zinc, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E and co-enzyme Q, Clark says.\nBut remember"}

At a generous estimate, one in twenty biopics is any good at all, and the errant masterpiece (Spike Lee\u2019s Malcolm X comes to mind, as does Scorsese\u2019s Raging Bull and Minnelli\u2019s Lust For Life; there are others, to be sure) invariably owes more to the skill of the filmmakers than to accurate historicity. This isn\u2019t an accident, and it has no inherent connection to the fact that most biopics are made as bald-faced attempts to win lots of awards. It\u2019s a fundamental artistic issue: if you\u2019re making a movie about a real event or real people, and your central goal is to represent the event or people accurately, make a documentary. The second you go about writing scripts and casting actors and sewing costumes and building sets, you\u2019re in a realm where the film\u2019s artistry is its raison d\u2019etre and the most important characteristic in critical evaluation. Which leads neatly into Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s Jackie, featuring Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy, which is opening in theaters this coming weekend and is one of the best biopics in quite some time.\nJackie jumps around in time a bit, framed narratively by the interview Jackie gave Life magazine\u2019s Theodore H. White shortly after her husband\u2019s assassination, flashing back at intervals to the assassination itself and to a television special featuring the First Lady some years before. The decision to tell this particular story this way is an indication that Jackie is not exclusively concerned with history, but with the way in which history is written, proven at great length with the repeated instances in which Portman\u2019s Jackie insists that Billy Crudup\u2019s Theodore H.

They not only got noticed but that pretty much all the reactions, negative and positive\u2013 but especially the non-reactive and non-alarming\u2013 they received contributed to educating people about their constitutional rights and that law-abiding citizens exercising their constitutional rights did not hurt anyone, unlike the countless individuals who had committed crimes and mass shootings: they didn\u2019t casually walk around showing that they were armed but attacked their victims by surprise with well hidden weapons.\nI wonder how much effect the fairly extensive news coverage of the stand off between heavily armed government agents and hundreds of legally armed citizens at the Bundy Ranch going on at the same time as the Arts Festival had on how festival goers and media reacted. That government overreach and overwhelming show of military-style power certainly made many reasonable people rethink about the practical real-life application of the 2nd Amendment in modern America where citizens are concerned not just about protecting themselves and their properties from criminal individuals but from an expanding government that is willing to use militarized law enforcement agencies to enforce laws, or impose its will or the wills of law enforcement agents themselves, against its mostly unarmed and usually innocent civilians. In other words, the Founding Fathers who carefully wrote the U.S. Constitution were not thinking of just hunting and recreational shooting when they chose to express the citizens\u2019 right to bear arms as the second most important right in their minds when they wrote, argued, and approved that revolutionary document.

Felix Strevell, a former barber who pleaded guilty to looting a high-paying state job that he had landed through political connections.\nA recent ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. Sharpe allows federal prosecutors to keep sealed, for at least another year, court records containing information about Strevell's cooperation with the FBI and Internal Revenue Service.\nTwo years ago, prior to sentencing Strevell to six months home confinement and five years probation, Sharpe granted a request by attorneys for the Hearst Corp., which owns the Times Union, to unseal court records related to Strevell's cooperation. But the judge's ruling had a caveat that key details of the court records would remain sealed for one year -- at the government's request -- in part because it could jeopardize ongoing investigations.\nNo one has been prosecuted as a result of Strevell's cooperation, which helped him avoid a prison sentence.\nLast week, the judge approved a second, one-year extension that could keep the records sealed until March 2012.\nThe records sought by the newspaper relate to seven debriefings Strevell gave federal agents after his guilty plea in April 2007, two years after he was indicted.\nStrevell, 49, of Castleton, pleaded guilty to a felony count of honest services wire fraud. He admitted using his politically appointed position as the former head of the Institute for Entrepreneurship in Albany to fleece the now-defunct agency of $111,500. Federal prosecutors said Strevell also set up jobs for friends and relatives and that the actual losses may have topped $200,000.\nStrevell's sentence included repaying $111,500 in restitution to the state of New York. Court officials this week said Strevell has paid back just $4,100. Federal prosecutors recently obtained authorization to garnish Strevell's estimated $12,800-a-year state pension, payable monthly when he reaches age 55 in about six years.\nThe debriefings with Strevell took place six years after he quit his $263,000-a-year state job as revelations of financial abuse surfaced.\nPeople familiar with the debriefings said Strevell, who had strong ties to top state Republicans, provided information about alleged corruption within the ranks of local and state government, and also about mortgage fraud.\n\"He provided names, incidents, locations, relationships, things that were said to him and that he observed,'' Strevell's sentencing memorandum states. However, the next four lines of the document were redacted by the judge before the narrative continues: \"The high-level nature of many of the persons against whom Mr. Strevell provided information is a cause for anxiety beyond ... the run-of-the-mill white collar case.\"\nFederal prosecutors have sought the continued sealing of Strevell's cooperation details while acknowledging the information was not very useful, in part, because so much time has passed.\nIt's not unusual in New York's Northern District for investigations involving public officials and white-collar crimes to languish for years, records show.\nRex Smith, vice president and editor of the Times Union, said the newspaper intends to challenge the latest sealing order.\n\"Felix Strevell's crime was misuse of New"}

It\u2019s a common horticultural technique, but Van Aken uses it as a sculpting tool to transform a tree into, as he puts it, a piece of art, a research project and a form of conservation at once. As art, the 40 varieties on each tree bloom in a symphony of pink, white and crimson in the spring, then produce a multitude of fruits over the course of the summer. As research, they could provide some insight into pollination. And as a conservation project, they will help preserve native and heirloom varieties of fruit for future generations to enjoy.\nVan Aken had already grafted 20 varieties of stone fruits onto the trees before he planted them at Thompson\u2019s Point. Van Aken visits the little orchard twice a year to graft on more fruit, and will continue to do so through the third year of the project, he said, adding cherries next summer. Otherwise, others check on the trees for him, and Thompson occasionally sends Van Aken photographs so he can check for bugs or disease.\nThe fruiting is as orchestrated as the spring blossoms. Cherries come first in July, followed by apricots. The first of the Asian plums fruit at the end of July and European plums start showing up in August. Peaches arrive with the European plums, but last longer into the season.\nVan Aken and Thompson were surprised when the trees produced \u201cmany dozens of pieces of fruit\u201d last summer, Thompson said. Not enough to schedule a public tasting or use in any significant project, but enough for the creative folks at the Open Bench Project \u2013 a shared space for artists, makers and other creative types at Thompson\u2019s Point \u2013 to bake hand pies. And Thompson did a little sampling himself.\nVan Aken identified the green-and-red plum as a satsuma.\nNext year, Van Aken plans to graft more native Maine varietals of fruit onto the trees. He\u2019ll graft a McLaughlin plum, an \u201cexcellent fresh eating plum\u201d that originated in Bangor. He\u2019s also working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find a \u201cDowneaster peach\u201d that used to grow in South Portland; Van Aken said he expects to find that heirloom fruit through genetic material stored in the USDA archives"}

Now Harvey will be taking that strategy global by heading a new sports human rights watchdog.\nHarvey is preparing to move to Switzerland from the United States to serve as chief executive of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights, hoping governing bodies adopt some of FIFA\u2019s newfound commitment to making compliance on labour and discrimination issues central to whether a country can host a major event.\nThe game-changer was Qatar winning the vote to host the 2022 World Cup and the subsequent focus on labour conditions for migrant workers, which led to the energy-rich nation being compelled to provide greater protections. FIFA made bidders for the 2026 edition own up to their human rights risks and present a means of tackling them ahead of the vote this year.\nFIFA serves on the Centre for Sport and Human Rights\u2019 advisory board among 41 organizations across sports, along with sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Visa.\nIt\u2019s about leveraging the power of a country chasing a mega sports event to encourage changes.\nThat is necessary beyond major events, or high-profile teams.\nAfghan authorities suspended the head of the soccer federation and other officials this month after media revelations of allegations of sexual and physical abuse of female players. Harvey hopes the Centre for Sport and Human Rights can be an outlet for athletes, officials or workers around sport to report wrongdoing and have their safety protected.\n\u201cHuman rights defenders are targets,\u201d Harvey said.\nHowever, the centre still requires investment, she added.\nThe centre was launched in June and is chaired by former Irish President Mary Robinson, who has also served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\u201cWe need to bring human rights more centrally into sport and make people involved in sport realize that they have to take responsibility and they have to work on many issues at so many different levels from the big stadiums to discrimination or racism or trafficking,\u201d Robinson told the AP.\nUsing the centre\u2019s status, Robinson will be looking to secure greater protections for local communities impacted by sports events \u2014 such as the traders forced to close their stalls near World Cup venues, as Robinson complained to FIFA about during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 edition in Brazil.\n\u201cI hope they won\u2019t exclude those who you know could actually improve their living by being able to trade around the stadiums and get the footfall on big occasions,\u201d Robinson said.\nThere are also concerns about how free labour can be relied on to operate events."}

As OPEC ministers sit down at their Vienna headquarters, Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak plans to fly to St. Petersburg to meet President Vladimir Putin to decide on their country\u2019s contribution. Once the group\u2019s most important ally in the broader OPEC+ coalition decides how much it\u2019s ready to cut, the cartel will follow up.\n\u201cWe face stiff resistance from Russia for a large cut,\u201d said a senior OPEC delegate, asking not to be identified because discussions are private.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has made clear that it won\u2019t shoulder the burden of trimming production alone. In private conversations, delegates said a consensus was emerging around an overall cut, including Russia, of around 1 million barrels a day, although all cautioned the figure wasn\u2019t final.\nThe wait for Moscow signals how much OPEC has changed since 2016 when Saudi Arabia and Russia ended their historic animosity and started to manage the oil market together. The alliance has transformed OPEC into a duopoly in which Russia, which isn\u2019t a formal member of the cartel but part of the production cuts alliance, is asserting its power.\nWhile Middle Eastern producers are desperate to reverse the recent slump in prices to pay for government spending, sensitivities are different in Russia, where the government is running a budget surplus and a weak ruble mitigates the impact of lower prices. The government is concerned about the impact of higher prices on Russian consumers, stoking discontent with economic policy, according to one Kremlin official.\nA day of preliminary talks in the Austrian capital on Wednesday concluded with a panel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia recommending an output reduction lasting six months, but the committee didn\u2019t discuss how big any cuts should be.\nThe group may agree a formal cut of under a million barrels a day, Nigeria\u2019s oil minister, Emanuel Kachiwku said in a TV interview on Thursday morning.\nAlthough Russia, the largest producer in the wider group known as OPEC+, agreed to a cut in principle, the eventual size of their contribution remains undefined and will be key to putting together the final deal.\nIn private conversations earlier this week, OPEC delegates said that Saudi Arabia had favored a Russian cut of about 300,000 barrels a day, but Moscow was seeking a smaller reduction of about 150,000, said people familiar with those talks. Those differences persisted after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, OPEC delegates said.\nRussia\u2019s second-largest oil producer, Lukoil PJSC, is ready to comply with any request from the Kremlin but hopes output cuts won\u2019t be necessary, said Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov.\n\u201cI hope that maybe these measures won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg television in Vienna. An oil price around $60 suits the needs of producers and consumers and it should remain at that level in January, he said.

If you\u2019re a Nazca booby, it can get you killed.\nNazca boobies are monogamous, ground-nesting seabirds. Yes, monogamy is sweet and \u201cbooby\u201d is an amusing name, but they are far from kind to their nest mates.\nDuring each breeding season, a female Nazca booby will lay two eggs several days apart. If both hatch, the elder sibling pushes the younger out of the nest area, where it is either picked off by predators or dies of thirst and cold.\nThe younger chick doesn\u2019t stand a chance&colon; firstborn chicks can be up to 30 per cent larger, and once the young chick is outside the nest area, its parents ignore it and leave it to die \u2013 sometimes just centimetres away.\nThis obligate siblicide is an evolutionary insurance policy taken to the limit \u2013 the second egg is simply a back-up in case the first doesn\u2019t hatch.\nA 2008 study linked the murderous behaviour to high levels of testosterone and androgens in hatchlings. Given that they may be fighting to the death the moment they\u2019re out of the egg, it\u2019s not surprising that Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating levels of hormones such as testosterone than the closely related blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii), which kill their siblings only when food is scarce.\nThe bullying doesn\u2019t stop in the nest. When the siblicidal Nazca booby grows up, it sometimes seeks out unrelated chicks in the colony and \u201ccourts\u201d them with aggressive sexual intent. There is no apparent benefit to the behaviour as the unlucky chicks are sexually immature, and they can incur fatal cuts from these attacks.\nIt turns out that, like the human cycle of violence that leads some people who were abused by their parents to later abuse their own children, Nazca boobies that are bullied as nestlings are more likely to become bullies themselves. Jacquelyn Grace of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and colleagues wanted to find out how this cycle was passed on.\nIn a given breeding season, a large fraction of the adult population either doesn\u2019t breed, or tries and fails. About 80 per cent of non-breeding Nazcas, both male and female, display non-parental adult visitor behaviour \u2013 bullying unguarded nestlings \u2013 at least once.\nThe nestlings are vulnerable from about 30 days of age, when their foraging parents leave them unguarded, till about 80 days, when they\u2019re large enough to repel attacks by themselves.\nGrace\u2019s team protected some nestlings from this aggression with portable wire mesh enclosures when the parents were absent. They compared levels of testosterone and the stress hormone corticosterone in these protected nestlings with those in chicks that had been bullied.\nThey found that corticosterone concentration increased five-fold in nestlings during bullying episodes, and stayed 2.8 times higher until at least the morning after the event.\nThe researchers argue that these increased levels of hormone could have a long-term effect on the birds\u2019 brains and behaviour \u2013 affecting particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by repeated activation \u2013 leading bullied birds to later become bullies themselves.\nThe name \u201cbooby\u201d, by the way, comes from British seamen\u2019s slang for \u201cstupid\u201d.

But as cities like New York begin to roll out fees for people driving in the central district, here are some ways they can ensure their policy works as well as possible.\nNew York City just voted to implement a policy that will charge vehicles well over $10 to drive in the busiest parts of Manhattan. Called congestion pricing, the plan would raise money to fund much-needed repairs to the city\u2019s subway system, which serves a plurality (39%) of commuters and has, for the past few years, been failing at doing so reliably. The government has committed to some sort of congestion fee, and now will begin working on its specific design.\nWhile cities like London, Stockholm, and Singapore have implemented congestion pricing plans of their own in the past several decades, New York is the first U.S. city to join the fray. Car dependency\u2019s relatively strong hold in the U.S.\u2013even in the city where proportionally, the fewest people drive\u2013posed a significant hurdle in the push for a fee on driving in New York City, which has been years in the making. Now that the policy is set to be introduced, some transportation analysts have expressed concern that in trying too much to appease the car lobby, New York\u2019s policy might get too watered down to meaningfully address the city\u2019s traffic and subway budget needs.\nSo what must New York policymakers keep in mind in in order to make their congestion pricing plan effective? Fast Company spoke to some transportation experts who drew on both the lessons of other cities and their own extensive research into the subject to answer this question.\nSomething that\u2019s emerged as a sticking point in New York City\u2019s congestion pricing plan is carveouts: discounts or exemptions to the fee for driving in Manhattan south of 60th street. Charles Komanoff, a transportation policy expert who is widely known, in transit circles, as the creator of the Balanced Transportation Analyzer\u2013an astonishingly detailed spreadsheet that models how congestion charges would affect both traffic and transit funding\u2013has some strong words about exemptions. \u201cI\u2019m really impatient with most of this stuff,\u201d Komanoff says.\nKomanoff counts five potential carvouts: One for people who already paid a bridge toll on crossings into upper Manhattan; one for low-income car users; one for \u201cessential\u201d car trips by city workers; one for car trips to medical facilities; one for people with disabilities. \u201cAny given carveout is going to cost the commons more than it will benefit the individual trip that gets carved out,\u201d Komanoff says.\nAll of which is not to say, Komanoff adds, that he\u2019s unsympathetic to the particular needs raised in the conversation around carveouts, particularly for people with disabilities. But to him, the way to meet these needs is to implement the broadest possible congesting fee, and come up with more creative\u2013and potentially more effective and equitable\u2013ways to address people\u2019s particular needs.\nAnd for other categories, like car trips by city workers and low-income people (very few of whom actually drive into the central business district), what policymakers need to keep in mind, Komanoff says, is that a better-working transit system should alleviate the need for these trips in the first place. And a congestion price would help make that a reality. \u201cWe\u2019re all trained to see the particular and not the general, the immediate and not the diffuse,\u201d Komanoff says.

The next Friday morning, he tweeted, rebuking newspapers as \u201cfake news media\u201d and operating as a biased \u201copposition party\u201d that wrongfully portrays him as a congenital liar.\nPrior to this outburst, the president branded media \u201cthe enemy of the American people\u201d and dismissed much of its coverage as \u201cfake news.\u201d As an example of reports smearing his reputation, Trump told reporters Paul Manafort, his former presidential campaign manager, was victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d after being convicted on eight criminal accounts.\nTrump uses \u201cwitch hunt\u201d as a catchall term of derision when referring to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election meddling. Did the Trump campaign capitalize on this interference to influence 2016 presidential election results?\nConstantly branding the media\u2019s questioning of his credibility as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d the president reminds Americans of another tumultuous time in 1798. Then Thomas Jefferson referred to this contentious era as \u201ca reign of witches\u201d in a July 4, 1798, letter to Virginia pamphleteer John Taylor. President John Adams and the Federalist Party blocked dissent by prosecuting and jailing newspaper editors who supported Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republican Party.\nThe Federalists railed against Roman Catholic Irish and French immigrants who applied for citizenship. Adams and cohorts argued that such low-class misfits would corrupt Protestantism and undercut law and order in America.\nIn the Alien Act, the Federalists lengthened from seven to 14 years the time that foreigners were forced to live in the United States before becoming citizens. Conservative politicians erected walls of animosity against the French and Irish to preserve their white, Protestant power-base rooted in northern European culture.\nHeaded by Adams and Alexander Hamilton, the Federalists also passed the Sedition Act, arguing that \u201cthe Constitution and the government it authorized were so fragile that their future depended on the individuals who made up government (that is, President John Adams\u2019 administration). To allow anyone to destroy their reputations, or the reputation of the government, was to risk bringing down the whole constitutional system,\u201d reports Jefferson\u2019s biographer R.B. Bernstein (\u201cJefferson,\u201d Oxford University Press, 2003, p.124).\nConsequently, the Federalists jailed only newspaper editors and writers from Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republican Party.\nToday, most reporters in the public press dissent against Trump\u2019s lies and half-truths. The president strikes back, dismissing as demonic diatribes what reporters expose.\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus foreshadows Jefferson\u2019s \u201creign of witches\u201d imagery. He identities the source of lying: \u201cLet what you say be simply \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019; anything more than this comes from the Evil One (the Devil)\u201d (Matthew 5:37).\nIs media spreading \u201cfake news?\u201d Or does President Trump spew a witches\u2019 brew of deceit?\nThe Washington Post regularly updates its Truth Tracker on President Trump.

I'm not sure what race he is. Who cares what race he is?\" Adds Dickstein, \"We never had directorial categories here, like automotive or tabletop. We just have directors. I look at Chris as a director who's black - not a black director. There's a depth to his work that transcends any genre. \"\n\"It'll take time to be judged as just a filmmaker,\" admits the 31-year-old Robinson. \"We're still dealing with that in our culture in America, learning to judge people by the merit of what they do. Make no mistake, before anything I'm Chris Robinson the black man. That's just a truth, and I'm very proud of that. But if you put the reel up, it should be, 'Hey, that's a good filmmaker,' or 'That's a funny filmmaker.' Not, 'That's a black filmmaker.' \"\nIf you put the reel up, Robinson's work is impressive indeed. Nevertheless, he comes out of the largely segregated world of hip-hop video, and his first commercial, for And 1 and Fallon/Minneapolis, starring NBA wunderkind Kevin Garnett, is more or less a hip-hop video, with beats by none other than Timbaland. Which is partly why Robinson got the gig. He's the kind of guy who's on a first-letter basis with people like P. Diddy, and, as he puts it, \"I could just pick up the phone and call Timbaland.\"\n\"It's true this whole And 1 thing came about because of a certain credibility Chris has with rappers and musicians, but the idea, which is bold in its expression, is told with an amazing sense of humanity and emotion,\" says Dickstein. As Robinson explains, \"If you put classical music behind this commercial you'd still have a story about Kevin Garnett's psyche and his journey from being a kid in South Carolina who was in trouble with the police and whose mom burned his jersey 'cause she didn't want him to play basketball. It's a story about his life - but his life happens to have a hip-hop soundtrack to it.\"\nAs does Robinson's, of course. He grew up in Baltimore and later moved to California where he enrolled at Foothill Junior College and played nose guard on the football team. It was there that he \"got bit by the film bug,\" he says. \"I always wanted to have a camera in my hand.\" He started making small-time videos for friends and eventually got a break with Profile Records, then home to Run DMC, for a video for a rapper known as Smooth Da Hustler, around 1993. \"When I came in, the groundwork really wasn't set for hip-hop videos,\" he recalls. \"The guys that I looked up to were Mark Romanek, David Fincher and Jean-Bapt"}

The logic follows that, flush with a $550 billion surplus this year, the legislature made a very poor decision in cutting the budget of NC Department of Environmental Quality by $1.8 million through 2019.\nThe recent budget bill directed DEQ to achieve this by Reorganization through Reduction program. Stripped of its Orwellian overtones, RTR means doing more with less, begging employees to take early retirement, shifting workloads so one person does the work of two, and probably shaking the printer cartridges to milk every single precious drop of cyan.\nThese cuts have occurred while the state budget overall has increased and the environmental crises facing North Carolina \u2014 GenX, coal ash, emerging contaminants \u2014 have become more complex. Forgive North Carolinians if they forget to count their blessings.\nAssistant Secretary of the Environment Sheila Holman told the oversight committee that to reach the required RTR benchmark, DEQ will pay nearly $468,000 in severance and $58,000 in health insurance to 12 employees who took the buyout and whose positions are state-funded. This equals an average of $39,000 each in severance, which is based on length of service, plus $4,833 apiece for health insurance.\nEven with the payouts, the RTR is projected to save $446,400 in appropriated funds.\nSuch details weren\u2019t available at the meeting, but Holman told the committee that positions within administration, coastal management, customer service, waste management, and energy, mining and land resources were eliminated.\nThe Division of Water Resources remained unscathed because the budget directive came down in June as the GenX crisis was escalating.

{"idx": "19346", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Is the Internet better for Christ or for cats?\nWhile the title of this blog post may seem flippant, I do mean it to raise serious questions about how well Christians are using new modes of communication. Also, please don\u2019t hate me for posting seemingly flippant things on Good Friday. I hope all Christian readers of this blog have a solemn and meaningful end to their Holy Week before the joy of Easter.\nHere\u2019s what lies behind this question: In the Reformation, Christians (mostly Protestants initially, but eventually Catholics, too) made very good use of a powerful new tool for communication: the printing press. Something like 20% of books printed in Germany in the middle of the 16th century were written by Martin Luther. Very few, if any of them, were picture books of cats (a phenomenon that would only emerge much later). See Mark Edwards\u2019 book Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther for a great example of an argument about how important printing was to the success of the Reformation.\nI wonder, though, if the Internet as another powerful new tool for communication is feeding any Christian movements as significant as the Reformation. Certainly, some Christians have made good use of the Internet. I think Christians have taken especially well to podcasts and blogs (hence this blog), and I know Rob Bell and others do good things with video. But Christianity and Christians seem not to have generated a lot of what has really caught on around the interwebs. Jesus has yet to go viral. And a lot of ways that Christians have tried to use the Internet have failed or just seemed hokey. And successful or unsuccessful, a lot of Christian uses of the Internet have served to perpetuate a Christian subculture rather than to disseminate the message of Jesus to the wider culture (think Godtube).\nThus, it seems to me that cats have benefitted much more from the Internet than Christ, whereas Christ definitely benefitted more from the printing press than cats. Why is this? Four possible reasons spring to my mind. The first two I don\u2019t think should trouble Christians that much. The second two should.\nThe first reason is the breadth of the medium for printing and the Internet. Maybe 10% of Europe was literate at the invention of the printing press. It tended to be the 10% who was most educated and thus most potentially interested in debating theology. Of course, a lot of what sold of Luther\u2019s was more low-brow, and those who were literate read Luther\u2019s (and others\u2019 works) to those who weren\u2019t literate, but printing was itself a form of narrowcasting. The Internet, on the other hand, is limited only by issues of access and rarely by issues of ability. If you\u2019ve got a router, you can be looking at Youtube videos. Thus, the Internet appeals to a much wider slice of the population, and if you assume that only a more-or-less fixed percentage of the human population is going to be initially interested in talking about religion, then that percentage is going to make up a smaller portion of those on the Internet than it did those reading books and pamphlets in the Reformation.\nThe second reason has to do with the nature of communication and memes on the Internet vs. in print. While print can certainly be used to produce short, pithy things, books and even pamphlets are really designed to convey arguments, explanations, etc. The depth of the medium is conducive to conveying more substantial messages, such as the sorts of religious messages Christians want to promote. The Internet, and especially Internet memes, operate via pictures, short videos, and short bits of writing. These means can convey very powerful messages"}

Since coming to power the Coalition has increased the discount dramatically, with an increase to a maximum of 70% of the market price taking effect this year.\nIn 2010, the year the Coalition came to power, the average sale price for social homes in England was \u00a381,695. By 2013, the last year for which data is available, the government's hike in discounts had cut the average sale price of a council home to \u00a359,044. Revenue is likely to fall even further this year, as the 70% discount comes into force.\nMeanwhile the average price of a UK house for ordinary buyers hit \u00a3250,000 in February \u2013 nearly five times as much.\nIt costs \u00a3141,000 to build an average council home, according to National Audit Office figures: two and a half times the amount raised by the average council house sale.\nThe sale price of homes under Right to Buy is nowhere near enough to cover a direct replacement, as the above graph shows. But on top of this, only 42% of money raised from a Right to Buy sales can go to fund new homes. (The Treasury takes 33%, and councils keep 25% for their general funds).\nBut councils or housing associations cannot use the funds from Right to Buy sales to build traditional social housing. Instead they are allowed to help fund new properties that are made available at the \"affordable\" rents, a new standard introduced by the current government, which can be as high as 80% of the market rate.\nThe fall in prices is great news for social tenants who can buy their home: they get a house at a far lower cost than everyone else and get onto the housing ladder. It's not such good news for people on housing waiting lists, who have to wait longer as the number of homes available for social rent falls away.\nAdam Morton, policy leader at the National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords, told BuzzFeed that the policy was leading to the depletion of social rented homes at housing associations: \u201cThe increased discount means they receive much less money per sale, making it very difficult to replace affordable homes one for one.\"\nIncreasing the Right to Buy discount has led to a surge of applications from council tenants to buy their own home in London, where house prices are highest.\nEven if these council homes are replaced, the replacements would have to be at \"affordable\" rent, as much as 80% of the market rents in that area. In many areas of Zone 2 that would be over \u00a31,000 a week for a three bedroom flat.\nMinisters promised that every home sold under Right to Buy would be replaced by a new home.

No more importing fossil fuels,\" said Richard Wallsgrove, the program director for the Blue Planet Foundation. \"No more paying for that through the nose when the price goes up, no more inflicting environmental damage around the world on climate, on ground water, and on those sorts of things.\"\nHawaii is the first state in the country to set such an ambitious target, though officials say achieving it will require considerable effort.\n\"It's not going to be easy. It's going to require sacrifices,\" said Randy Iwase, Chair of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. \"It's going to be asking a lot of communities where solar farms are located, wind farms are located, geothermal production is located, that these are important for us if we're going to move forward toward that goal.\"\nDespite the challenges, it's a goal that is attainable with the cooperation of all key players, including the state's energy utility, which supports the legislation.\n\"The great thing about what the state has done to help set this up is a regulatory principle called de-coupling,\" said Jim Alberts, Senior Vice President of Customer Service for the Hawaiian Electric Company. \"We no longer earn based on the energy that we sell. It's a function of the investments that we make, so for us, we're really in this just as much as everybody else.\"\n\"The law sets benchmarks that require the state to be at 30 percent renewable within five years, and 70 percent renewable by 2040. Clean energy advocates say the law revolutionizes clean energy initiatives.\n\"It's going to be a filter on all kinds of energy policy making decisions from the government, from utilities and from consumers,\" said Mark Duda, Hawaii P.V. Coalition President. \"Until we actually reach this goal, it's going to start eliminating bad choices quickly and drive everything towards these good choices.\"\nHawaii residents typically pay between two and three times the national average for electricity, but officials believe the addition of new renewable energy resources will help stimulate price decreases, reducing the state's reliance on the more than $4 billion spent annually on imported oil.\nIn addition to the 100 percent renewable energy measure, Governor Ige"}

Even so, the player that can control the game on both ends of the floor is a rare breed indeed.\nIf Thursday night\u2019s Region 11 matchup between the Tooele Buffaloes and Juan Diego Soaring Eagle was any indication, Tooele senior Emily Webber is that kind of player.\nLed by Webber, who scored a game-high 10 points, the Buffaloes defeated the Soaring Eagle 35-23 at Juan Diego Catholic High School. The victory marked the fourth triumph in a row for Tooele (9-4, 5-0) and doubled as the school\u2019s fifth region victory.\nWebber\u2019s impact on the result was felt immediately and often, in almost every aspect of the game.\nOn the offensive end, the center scored four of the Buffaloes eight first-quarter points. On defense, her active hands led to deflection after deflection, plays that helped limit the Soaring Eagle (7-9, 3-3) to just two points in the opening period.\nHer sister Abby Webber had a noticeable impact on the defensive end as well in the first quarter and the pair of Webbers made it almost impossible for the Soaring Eagle to find any purchase in the paint, a fact that resulted in numerous wasted offensive possessions.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the second quarter that the hosts began to figure out a way around Tooele\u2019s twin towers.\nLed by senior Eva Tavake, who scored four points in the game, Juan Diego began to utilize a more physical and aggressive approach. As a result, the second period was much more competitive, with Tooele barely winning the period by a score of 12-10.\nThe physical nature of the game resulted in more than a few freebies for the Buffaloes, Tooele attempted 11 free throws in the second quarter alone and 24 in the game, which they didn\u2019t always take advantage of. Nonetheless, Goss was pleased with the response by the Buffaloes.\nThat response didn\u2019t come until the fourth quarter, however, as the Soaring Eagle emerged from halftime, trailing by eight, engaged and raring to go.\nWhen coupled with a full court press that Tooele seemed unable to break, that attitude enabled Juan Diego to completely control the third period.\nLaulea Tavake, Maya Sherrell, Brianna Ahlstrom and Eva Tavake each made their mark felt in the frame, with Ahlstrom\u2019s efforts off the bench igniting the Soaring Eagle crowd time and again.\nThe host\u2019s pulled as close as three points with a few minutes remaining in the quarter, at which point Tooele seemed primed to collapse.\nA key bucket by Whitney Murray halted the Soaring Eagle charge, however, and the Buffaloes entered the fourth quarter with a five-point advantage.\nIt was in the fourth period that Webber truly made her mark. She kicked off the scoring for Tooele with a sideline jumper, after which she waved at her bench and fans almost as if to say goodbye to the Soaring Eagle.\nWhile she didn\u2019t score again in the period, her play and positioning broke the Juan Diego full court press throughout the period, enabling Tooele to t"}

After the proposal is accepted, the faculty votes on it, said Prof. Erich Mueller, physics and director of undergraduate studies in the department.\nAccording to Mueller, the new minors will also allow students to explore different disciplines without overloading their course loads.\n\u201cSome of these students, they come in, they are interested in so many things \u2026 and by the end of sophomore year, they realize that even if they can do it, they are not getting [as] much out of multiple majors [as] they thought they would,\u201d he said.\nAdditionally, the arts college\u2019s new offerings may have resulted from increased interest in the disciplines, as opposed to smaller enrollment. For instance, Prof. Lars Wahlbin, mathematics, director of undergraduate studies in the department, said the number of math majors has increased in the last few years.\nWahlbin said the minor may reflect the recently growing popularity of higher-level mathematics courses.\nMueller noted that there was also an increase in the number of graduates majoring in physics; the department saw approximately 10 more students in the major in the last two years. Every year, students have asked if a minor is offered in physics, he said.\nMinors also allow students to receive official recognition for in-depth coursework in these fields, even if they are not in the arts college, Wahlbin said.\n\u201cWe hope to allow students outside of the college to have formal recognition,\u201d he said.\nProf. Hayden Pelliccia, classics, said the minors also allow students to explore new subjects, according to a University press release.\n\u201cOur hope is that the growing number of students who are interested in the cultures, literatures, languages, history, philosophy, art and archaeology of classical antiquity, but who don\u2019t wish to major in classics, will use this minor as a guide toward a more balanced understanding of the ancient world,\u201d Pelliccia said.\nAccording to Lepage, offering more minors allows students to have more academic flexibility than if a student takes two majors.\nMueller said minors allow students to avoid the onerous workload of another major while maintaining their acadmic freedomm.\n\u201cWe allow students to explore where they want to go, and protect them from overloading, and the minor is a great way to do that,\u201d Mueller said.\nSome students, excited about new opportunities open to them, said that the minors will give them greater flexibility in choosing what to study.\n\u201cAlthough I had not considered it before, now that there are these new minors I can study those subjects in a way I could not when there were just majors,\u201d Michelle Jeffers \u201915 said."}

The theory of consumer choice subject to multiple binding constraints provides structure that can be used in estimating shadow value functions jointly with behavior or other relationships.

He might as well have blamed us for throwing ourselves in the path of a hurricane.\nApart from the cost, the worst part about this catastrophe for Trump seems to be how damn ungrateful these Puerto Ricans are. The president called the mayor of San Juan, the capital, a \u201cpolitically motivated ingrate\u201d over the weekend. Then, on Tuesday, he suggested the island was exaggerating its woes. Puerto Rico isn\u2019t facing \u201ca real catastrophe like Katrina\u201d the president said. Just grow up and stop all your whining, in other words.\nTrump arrived on the island more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit. Despite what he claims, the situation is still devastating. Only 5% of the electrical grid has been repaired; only 17% of the cellphone towers are working and more than half the island has no running water. Most of Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.5 million citizens have to stand every day in hellish lines for food, water, gas and medicines. This is the new normal for us and our families.\nYet, the president spent much of his time on the island patting his administration on the back for how well it is handling everything. \u201cYou can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what\u2019s been taking place in Puerto Rico,\u201d he said.\nDuring a \u201cpress conference\u201d at the Luis Mu\u00f1iz air national guard base in San Juan \u2013 in which he took no questions from the press \u2013 Trump praised the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, military commanders and a half-dozen members of his cabinet, who accompanied him to Puerto Rico.\nHe reserved nothing, not one word of encouragement and empathy for the Puerto Rican people, who are the ones that have shouldered the brunt of this tragedy all by themselves.\nAnd if all of this wasn\u2019t enough, after his pompous speech, Trump was taken to see the devastation in one of the wealthiest municipalities of the whole island: Guaynabo. Even in forgotten, neglected Puerto Rico, Trump reminds us that there is a pecking order \u2013 and it\u2019s the rich and powerful living in gated communities who come before all others.\nAnd what did Trump do in Guaynabo? He threw out rolls of paper towel and bags of rice to the well-heeled Puerto Ricans. It was a pathetic performance, and deeply offensive, especially as people in the interior of the island have next to nothing.\nHurricane Maria was not enough to bring the Puerto Rican people to its knees. I doubt that Tuesday\u2019s farce will dent our resolve. It has only served to make us more aware of the truth \u2013 which is that we must save ourselves."}

The rumors went global, and though since disproved they persist, almost in the manner of conspiracy theory.\nAmong several users who wrote the Guardian with such allegations (and screenshots) in response to this story was Caroline Ardrey, 25, a doctoral student at Oxford.\n\"There are lots of people who are really angry about having their privacy abused, not least me,\" wrote Ardrey. She remains convinced that Facebook invaded her privacy and that of her friends.\nIn a phone interview with the Guardian on October 10, Facebook's Pan-Euro communications manager Iain Mackenzie said a rash of similar allegations arose last year but that they \"didn't gain the same traction\" as recent reports.\n\"We did a really high priority investigation of it,\" which included a review with the site's engineers, Mackenzie said. \"To have [private messages] publish to [private walls], somebody would've had to make a technological mechanism that was never created.\"\nSimply put, here's the explanation: people spoke differently on Facebook when Zuckerberg first built it; it was college-kids-only, after all. But when the company cast a wider social net \u2013 employers, parents, distant relatives, far-flung friends \u2013 the tone changed. And not knowing exactly how those old public messages were going to be displayed on public-facing timelines years later resulted in confusion and, later, suspicion that borders on conspiracy theory.\n\"Facebook doesn't exist in isolation,\" Mackenzie said. \"There are bad things and many good things going on in the online world. It's not surprising that people look at the service that's closest to them and are at least receptive to these myths.\"\nAnother topic of scrutiny Mackenzie acknowledges was a recent story that reported that the content of private Facebook messages is analyzed by the network in order to compute a number score on shares, likes and interactions around a news story, public figure or topic. This is different from liking a Facebook page, which still takes direct user interaction. But a video posted by Polish programmers showing them gaming the system resulted in Facebook's quick acknowledgment that a bug did in fact exist.\nStill, analyzing public and private conversations to put a number score on shares and likes around a topic \"has been a part of the platform possibly as long as Facebook has existed,\" Mackenzie added.\nThe problem, it seems, is that the rumors attempting to deconstruct how"}

Transit advocates report that a nasty cycle is in the works: as buses and trains cut services in response to the recession, more passengers get in their cars, leading to more budget shortfalls.\nIn Sacramento, the capital, politicians continue trying to find ways to meet the state's emissions and renewable energy targets, despite the problems.\nYesterday, governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited Cobalt Biofuels, which wants to make fuel from wood waste, to tout a plan to temporarily remove the state sales tax for green manufacturing equipment. That would also benefit companies like Nanosolar, Solyndra and Tesla Motors, who all plan to expand manufacturing in the state.\nA day earlier, on Monday, a state panel proposed returning funds from auctioned carbon permits and higher energy prices to consumers, as much as $1,000 for families of four. However, since the funds would come as tax cuts or delayed dividend checks, consumers would still get high energy bills in the mail, spurring them to reduce usage.\nFor companies -- other than those making solar panels or electric cars -- all of these moves probably sound rather risky, so business opposition will probably remain strong.

Here's a guide to who pays, how much, and more.\nIf you hire a real estate agent to help you buy, sell, or rent a house, this professional gets paid through a real estate commission. So how much do you pay, and what for? Is there any wiggle room to negotiate this fee?\nAs a real estate agent myself, allow me to tell you firsthand everything you need to know about real estate commissions, from who pays to how much to where that money goes.\nHow much is a real estate commission?\nRather than getting paid hourly or weekly fees, most real estate agents earn money only when a real estate deal goes through.\nWhile there are some real estate agents who will charge a flat fee for their services, most charge a percentage of the sales price of the home once the deal is done. That exact percentage varies, but the commission is typically 5% to 6% of a home\u2019s final sales price. On a $200,000 home, a 6% commission would amount to $12,000.\nGranted, this may seem like a serious chunk of change, but keep in mind that no one makes off with the whole amount! Plus, real estate agents don't see a dime until a buyer finds a home she loves, the seller accepts the offer, and all parties meet at the closing table. That process can mean weeks or months of work.\nGenerally, the home seller pays the full commission for the services of both their own listing agent and the buyer's agent (assuming the buyer has one).\nBuyer's and seller's agents typically split the commission. So if a home sells for $200,000 at a 6% commission, the seller's agent and buyer's agent might split that $12,000, and each receive $6,000.\nHowever, the commission split varies from one agent to another, with new agents sometimes earning a smaller percentage of the commission than experienced agents who sell more homes or more expensive properties.\nWorking With a Seller's Agent: Is Dual Agency Worth It for Home Buyers?\nCan a Real Estate Agent Get a Commission After the Contract Expired?\nWhat Is a Transaction Fee and Who Pays It?\nHowever, because it puts them in a sticky position of having to work for both the seller and the buyer, many agents don\u2019t practice dual agency\u2014and some states don\u2019t even allow it. I believe it creates a conflict of interest. After all, clients hire me to represent their best interests. How can I do that when I'm sitting on both sides of the table?\nWhat does a real estate agent commission cover?\nThough people certainly have the option of selling (or buying) their house without a real estate agent, agents provide clients a wide range of services, including helping you price your home, marketing it (on the multiple listing service, social media, and other venues), negotiating with home buyers, and ushering the home sale through closing.\nAs trained experts, real estate agents can help you fetch top dollar for your house and put out fires\u2014while also alleviating some of the stress that comes with selling a home. (It\u2019s no picnic!) I might be biased, since I\u2019m an agent myself, but great ones earn their keep.\nWant proof?

{"idx": "19397", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Former New York Times columnist Richard Rothstein has published a powerful book at a critical moment. We find ourselves poised on the brink of change, but just at this moment, we seem to be wavering. In my view, No Child Left Behind was a dismal failure. Nonetheless as we go forward some leaders seem bound and determined to preserve many of its most destructive elements. In Grading Education: Getting Accountability Right, Rothstein has come along just in time to remind us what we should be focused on.\nIf we can agree that all of these goals are important, then we arrive at the first problem with our current accountability system. It is focused almost entirely on academic skills and knowledge and even that is primarily in the areas of reading and math. Rothstein points out that when we reward one set of outcomes above others, unrewarded outcomes suffer. I see this firsthand in the poorer elementary schools in my district, where many teachers report they lack instructional time for science because of the pressure to boost reading and math.\nIf we hope to use tests for school or teacher accountability, we might be tempted to ignore the unreliability of any single student\u2019s score and assume that some students\u2019 good days would offset other students\u2019 bad days; then, the average results for an entire grade or class would be accurate, a fair indication of schools\u2019 and teachers\u2019 effectiveness even if individual student scores could not provide such an indication. In any survey or assessment, the larger the number of students tested, the more likely it is that erratic scores will cancel each other out in an average. But as it turns out, most schools are too small to support statistical confidence that childrens\u2019 good and bad days will average out with a single test.\nInadequate schools are only one reason disadvantaged children perform poorly. They come to school under stress from high-crime neighborhoods and economically insecure households. Their low-cost day-care tends to park them before televisions, rather than provide opportunities for developmentally appropriate play. They switch schools more often because of inadequate housing and rents rising faster than parents' wages. They have greater health problems, some (like lead poisoning or iron-deficiency anemia) directly depressing cognitive ability, and some causing more absenteeism or inattentiveness. Their households include fewer college-educated adults to provide rich intellectual environments, and their parents are less likely to expect academic success. Nearly 15 percent of the black-white test-score gap can be traced to differences in housing mobility, and 25 percent to differences in child- and maternal-health.\nYet contemporary test-based accountability policies that establish the goal of all students being proficient require that school improvement alone -- higher expectations, better teachers, improved curriculum, and more testing -- should raise all children to high levels of achievement, poised for college and professional success. Natural human variability would still distinguish children, but these distinctions would have nothing to do with family disadvantage. If true, there really would be no reason for progressive housing or health and economic policies. The nation's social and economic problems would take care of themselves, by the next generation.\nTeachers of children who come to school hungry, scared, abused, or ill, consider this absurd. But increasingly, in our test-based accountability environment, pronouncements of politicians and some educational leaders intimidate teachers from acknowledging the obvious. Instead, teachers are expected to repeat the mantra \"all children can learn,\" a truth carrying the false implication that the level to which children learn has nothing to do with their starting points. Teachers are warned that any mention of children's socioeconomic disadvantages only \"makes excuses\" for teachers' own poor performance."}

You don't need vanity storage with shelf, bin, hanging basket and built-ins that you can make.\nYou have plenty of storage space under a pedestal sink when you enclose this area with fabric panels. Hem two panels to size, so that they hang from just under the sink to the floor, meeting in the front for easy access. Hang them with hook-and-loop tape, so you can take them down to launder as needed. For a small bathroom, use vividly patterned fabric with stylish punch.\nExplore wall storage ideas when you don't have a vanity. Secure a wine rack near the sink or tub for rolled towels. Mount wooden boxes by their bottoms in staggered or straight rows for lotions, makeup or hair-styling appliances. Fix a magnetic strip to the wall for hairpins, tweezers, nail clippers, scissors and other small metal items. Even toothbrush holders come in wall-mounted varieties, and some full-length mirrors have storage behind them, built into the design.\nIf you ignore the door, you're missing various storage opportunities, other than towel and housecoat hooks. Hang two or three towel bars on the door back, not just for towels, but also for small cloth bags for color-sorted laundry to contain dirty clothes. Add a few S-hooks to a bar for hanging bath brushes, loofahs or any other small items with loops or holes in their handles for hanging.\nBy framing the door's upper sides with decorative corbels, you bring the eye up, increasing a small bathroom's visual height and creating a place for an over-the-door shelf. Use this storage space for tissue roll storage and jars of toiletries, such as cotton balls and swabs.\nDecorative chain isn't just for swag-style lamps;, if it's installed to bathroom and electrical codes, such a lamp brightens and enlivens a small space. Hang silver, bronze or gold-colored chain from the ceiling near a wall. Use clothespins to hold small items, from makeup bags to just-washed undies to dry on the chain. Hanging near the sink, three-tiered fruit baskets make ideal storage bins for folded facecloths, hand towels and prettily packaged soaps.\nTraditional shelves protrude, consuming interior space.

That peak around here is likely to arrive the third or fourth week of October--later than in years past when earlier mid-October color peaks were more common.\nThe Morton Arboretum's chief scientist, Gary Watson, says that more than the weather, shorter days and longer nights this time of year have the largest impact on the annual explosion of color in foliage. Environmental factors, including plant genetics, rainfall and the nutrients available to trees, all impact the seasonal color change. But, when it comes right down to it, the seasonal shift in sunlight intensity and the arrival of shorter days and longer nights prove most critical in encouraging leaves to cut back on, and ultimately stop, the production of chlorophyll, which produces the leaves' characteristic green color. When chlorophyll is reduced and finally eliminated, as happens when days shorten, naturally occurring yellows and oranges linked to substances known as carotenoids, as well as red hues produced by other substances in leaves known as anthocyanins, become visible, Watson says.\nTim Johnson, director of horticulture at the north suburban Chicago Botanic Garden, says warm, sunny autumn days encourage sugar production in leaves, which in turn promotes the presence of red pigment-bearing anthocyanins in certain trees, like maples. At the same time, cool nights encourage the veins in leaves to close, reducing the flow of sugars and red pigments out of the leaves. The result: An explosion of red in the leaves of such trees.\nJohnson says the weather can affect the intensity of fall colors in other ways.\nStrong winds can knock leaves off trees. So can heavy rain.\nCloudy fall days and warm nights act to dull colors.\nTrees under other forms of stress, as when a house or building is constructed nearby, may shed leaves early and exhibit a diminished range of colors.\nThese state and national tourism offices can serve as resources for staying up-to-date on fall foliage.

Privacy is how data is handled and stored, and in that realm, Apple is superior, she said.\nAlternatively, Apple has been vocal about its commitment to data privacy, storing more data locally on the device and sending less to its servers for ad targeting.\n\u201cThe narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is \u2018I\u2019ve got to take all of your data to make my service better.\u2019 Well, don\u2019t believe that.

Apple once again, said Ortega. That is because Apple\u2019s iOS has higher levels of scrutiny over what apps are allowed to be sold in the App Store.\nIn August 2018, Google removed 145 Android applications from its Play app store after security firm Palo Alto Networks informed Google they were infected with malware and stealing data from users.\nGoogle\u2019s Android platform is considered to be open-source with a much more accessible development platform and Play store. This means web developers can more easily create content and apps for Android phones, and that users can customize their devices more easily. Apple is much more restrictive, meaning fewer malicious apps, but also less customization for the end user.\nAnother downside to Android? Its infrequent software updates. In July 2015, a security researcher found a bug in the code of Android devices that left more than 950 million devices vulnerable to hackers. Bugs like these are exacerbated by the company\u2019s failure to push updates to users.\n\u201cGoogle still has very little control over software updates, and Android users are basically at the mercy of their carriers and phone manufacturers when it comes to getting updates or new operating system versions,\u201d Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a security reporter at VICE\u2019s Motherboard, wrote in his article \u2018Goodbye, Android,\u2019 explaining why he switched to an iPhone.\nIn 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate wireless carriers including AT&T T, -1.46% , Verizon VZ, -2.15% , Sprint S, -0.18% , and T Mobile TMUS, -0.85% for failing to inform customers that Google\u2019s Android system could be running without critical security updates.\n\u201cAndroid smartphones that do not receive regular, prompt security updates are defective and unreasonably dangerous,\u201d the ACLU wrote.\nAlthough by many of these measures, Apple is more secure, users have a"}

{"idx": "19409", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: We embarked on a new backpacking adventure with our family. This was the first time we packed it all into the woods with nine strong and supplies.\nI awoke to the sound of youthful chatter.\nAs was later noted, Matthew had set his watch alarm for 5:37 a.m. (for reasons only a 10-year-old can understand), ushering in a twilight awakening on the northeast corner of the campground. Ten kids (three of which we inherited during the night) and two adults gradually emerged from four tents and set about rekindling the previous night\u2019s fire from lingering embers.\nThe previous day, we had undertaken a new backpacking adventure with our entire family. Although we had involved the older members the fall before, it was the first time we packed it all into the woods with nine strong with supplies we hoped would sustain us for the next 18 hours.\nIt had been a lingering winter, but as the 5-day forecast on the previous Tuesday finally promised a balmy, sunny weekend, Amy and I decided the opportunity to backpack with the entire family was one that we had to seize before the bugs and busy calendar became serious obstacles. With seven kids from ages 11 to 1, the first challenge was to consider just how we could organize a family outing that was rugged and yet reasonable.\nQuickly I set my sights on the German Ridge section of the Hoosier National Forest, which offered familiar trails; a beautiful, hilly landscape and a walk-in campground with good (albeit primitive) amenities that would reward a hike well done. The plan was to do about a 5.5-mile route from the car to the campground and then a roughly 2.5-mile hike back to the car the next morning.\nAnother significant challenge was figuring out how to get supplies for a family of nine to the campground without a motorized vehicle. Fortunately, after years of gradually acquiring backpacking equipment, the oldest four were largely responsible for their gear (minus the tents). Our 6-year-old, Will, got to take off with a modified school backpack (later carried by us at various times) and Big Lou (Louis), our 4-year-old, entered the forest with a pocketful of granola bars and (smashed) peanut butter crackers. That left Amy to carry our 1-year-old and me with a full pack of what was left.\nAdmittedly, sighting the first tick even before we hit the trail made for a little-unsettled beginning. And as Big Lou hung back with Amy during the first few hundred yards, I wondered if getting to camp might require a lot of bribery, repeated carrying and a few extra prayers. But suddenly, after we freed Lou of the snacks spilling from his pockets, he took off down the trail like a hyena after the herd. And the inaugural family backpack was on.\nAs we went deeper into the forest, only to see one person before reaching camp, the beauty of the rolling hills and carved valleys began to emerge. The pink, blooming redbuds framed the varied green sprouts contrasted by the brown, crackly leaves that coated the land. Small brooks met up with larger streams that promised a summer swimming hole but for now were just an exercise in footwork to avoid (at times unsuccessfully) submerging the many different sizes of shoes that crossed their paths.\nUp and down we went, the conversations as free-flowing as the landscape seemed to be, interspersed with silence and goofy exclamations of a"}

A neglected detached garage stared at me as I parked on the gravel drive.\nThe roof of this garage was in horrible shape. I estimated the shingles were at least 60 years old. The colored ceramic granules on most of the shingles were gone.\nI also spotted wood rot on the right side and front edge of the roof. The wood shakes covering the exterior walls needed some tender loving care as well.\nThe second home I bought back in 1976 had a nearly identical detached garage. Garages are valuable. To put it differently, there are quite a few uses for detached garages other than getting cars and trucks out of the weather.\nIn spite of the wretched exterior condition, as I peered through the windows I could see that the bones of the structure remained in great shape. The roof was not sagging. The walls were not bowed out. The hinged garage doors didn\u2019t fit quite right, but that\u2019s a small job, all things considered.\nI walked around the garage imagining what the roof repair might cost. I approached this problem as I had done with hundreds of my past remodeling and building jobs for paying customers.\nRemove existing shingles exposing wood roof sheathing.\nInstall new roof rafter tails or complete rafters where necessary.\nReplace rotted roof sheathing where necessary.\nBolster interior collar ties if needed.\nInstall new roof eave and fascia boards.\nInstall metal drip edge at all fascia boards.\nInstall new asphalt shingles with thin 12-inch copper ridge cap to extend the life of the asphalt.\nI quickly wrote on a piece of paper a fast material list and came up with about $1,200.00 worth of materials. The new shingles were the largest single cost item on the list.\nA point often overlooked is the time it takes to clear around the garage so you can work efficiently and safely. Out-of-control bushes on the right side of this garage needed to be trimmed back, in my opinion.\nLabor costs for roof repair are a moving target. It depends on the type of company or tradesperson you hire. I prefer to just go step by step and try to estimate the time for each of the tasks that need to be done.\nI estimated it would take a seasoned carpenter and his trained helper about five total days to complete the entire job. This garage roof repair is much more labor intensive than it is material intensive. If the total cost for these two workers is $120 per hour, then the labor cost is going to close to $5,000.\nSome jobs are the exact opposite. Take for example replacing a front door on a home. Often this job can be completed in one day by an expert carpenter and the door being installed may cost five times as much as the labor charge.\nIf you want the best prices when you solicit quotes from carpenters and roofers who will be looking at your garage roof, it\u2019s best to produce a simple set of specifications.\nBrand and type of paint to cover repaired/replaced surfaces.\nWhen you go to this effort, it\u2019s going to be far easier to compare the quotes, as the material costs should be very similar if the bidding contract"}

He was 80 years old.\nBy the time the evening edition of the Border Cities Star hit the streets later that day, editors and writers published thousands of words in an expansive tribute to the celebrated Canadian newsman who founded Windsor\u2019s first daily newspaper.\nThe obituary describes McNee as a \u201cpioneer\u201d journalist who, in addition to being president of the Parliamentary Press Gallery in Ottawa and later the president of the Canadian Press Association, made the bold move to start a daily newspaper in a struggling city with stiff competition from publications in Detroit.\nArch McNee, as he was known in the community, invested heavily in Windsor. In 1888, he left Winnipeg and headed for the border city where he bought and operated The Weekly Record. During a decade that saw the introduction of telephone service and an electric transit system in Windsor, McNee transformed his publication into a daily paper that hit city streets in the evenings.\nHe partnered with investor John McKay and the two ran the Windsor Record for nearly two decades. McKay commended his partner\u2019s bold move in a telegraph published the day after McNee\u2019s death. He describes the economic challenges of the city and the formidable competition they faced from U.S. papers already servicing the region, including the Detroit Free Press and the Northville Record.\n\u201cThe establishment by him of the first daily paper in 1890 at a time when Windsor was a struggling town, a field already overdone with four large Detroit papers, was a task that indeed required extreme foresight, to say nothing of audacious courage,\u201d McKay wrote.\nThe Record persevered. With several name changes over the past 125 years, McNee\u2019s paper became a perpetual news leader in Windsor, reporting on important issues in the late 19th century and shepherding us into the new Millennium.\nBut McNee\u2019s influence expanded well beyond his newspaper. His resume includes city councillor, school trustee and church deacon. Born and raised in Perth, he became one of the first graduates from Ontario Veterinary College in Toronto. The trained vet in 1874 moved to the newly created province of Manitoba where he worked as a licensed inspector for the province.\nHis journalism career began shortly after that point, when he joined the editorial staff at the Manitoba Free Press. McNee had immediate success and quickly headed to Ottawa where he represented the paper in the Parliamentary Press Gallery. He became the gallery president in 1885. Returning to Winnipeg, he became the managing editor and a director of the Free Press.\nIt\u2019s during those early years in the Manitoba capital that McNee broke into politics. Before leaving for Windsor in 1888, he served as city councillor and school trustee. Similar vision and leadership continued in the border city where, in addition to starting up the city\u2019s first daily paper, he became Senior Deacon at Bruce Avenue Baptist Church. Holding the position for 35 years, well into his retirement, McNee \u201clong had been recognized as the most influential member of that large congregation,\u201d according to the obituary that highlighted his accomplishments.\nHe retired in 1905, but kept his ownership of the Record until selling it to McKay two years later.

He estimates he has designed and built eight to ten homes.\nHis \"riverhouse\" is the latest of these, situated next to Fort Hunter on the east bank of the Susquehanna, close to the Rockville Bridge. He bought the lot 3 years ago, and says he spent about a year building his design for the residence.\n\"I came down here and I looked at the lot,\" says Lysaght, \"and I saw the fish, and I saw the eagles and I saw the trains, and my design for the house was such that I wanted to be able to always see all the activity and the life on the river.\"\nThe house features a large gallery-style room with a vaulted ceiling overlooks the Susquehanna through a wall of glass made of sixteen patio-size windows, eight below and eight above. The windows wrap around the ends of the room to that the view has a 3-dimenional persective. Color and design is kept minimalistic, in order not to distract from the sweeping view of the river. The floor is varnished rock-maple, recycled from the gymnasium of a school that closed down.\nLysaght's neighbor, well-known violinist Odin Rathnam, dropped in one day, having seen Lysaght's piano in the window, and hoped he might be able to secure the space for some studio lessons. But as he made his way around the space, he immediately noted another quality of the room. It had rich and vibrant acoutics.\n\"Look at what resembles acoustical paneling on the walls,\" Rathnam points out. \"Look at the high-vaulted ceilings, the maple floors. The reflective surfaces allow for reverb without over-boominess. There are all kinds of deflectors in place so you can have that sense of space. This is set up acoustically perfectly.\"\nIt didn't take long for an idea to be birthed. The room, with its magnificent view of sunsets over the river, its spaciousness and its live acoustics seemed an ideal venue for a series of evening house concerts. One such concert has already taken place, with Odin Rathnam joined by pianist John Nauman.\nLysaght is himself a music lover, but says he has no strong background in classical music. He sees part of his role as making sure that the choice of music performed has a strong appeal for listeners of different backgrounds.\nFeedback from the first concert caused Lysaught in install central air in the room and add spotlights for the stage area. The next program will feature popular pieces by Gershwin, Kreisler, Vivaldi and others related to heat and summer.\nGary Lysaght is eager to continue exploring the possiblities, \"If we could fuse together here in this environment that sanctity that the river gives you, and put this together with your audio experience, do we get another level of appreciation? I mean how far can we go to become intoxicated by just music and the environment?\"\nThe next concert will begin at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, August 12.

You need a transfer.\nPresident Trump seemingly found himself in the same position as New York commuters these days. He\u2019s getting some money for his border wall. But he\u2019s not all the way there yet. The border security package approved by Congress grants the President $1.375 billion for a physical barrier. Mr. Trump wants $5.7 billion.\nIn other words, Congress wields the ultimate power of the purse in American government. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution grants the President authority to either sign or veto bills.\nArticle I, Section 1 of the Constitution declares that \u201cAll legislative Powers herein shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. That means only the House and Senate control legislative text and dictates how it works. Not the executive branch.\nThere are 12 individual spending bills. Think of each as a silo containing various spending. One for Commerce, Justice & Science programs. Another for Defense. One for the Department of Homeland Security.\nLet\u2019s say we\u2019re talking about the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Loaded into each bill are multiple \u201caccounts.\u201d Congress steers money to various programs and projects in each account.\nImagine an \u201cAccount A\u201d and \u201cAccount B\u201d in the DHS measure. The administration may decide it needs more money for Account B. So, it wants to \u201creprogram\u201d the money from Account A to Account B. Such a maneuver is allowed. But the gambit entails a sign-off by the top members of House and Senate Appropriations Committees and DHS Appropriations Subcommittees.\nNow, let\u2019s go to a higher level of chess.\nCongress approves the DHS appropriations measure and the defense appropriations bill. The President signs both pieces of legislation into law. But down the road, the administration decides it has a need under the aegis of DHS and wants to transfer money from the Pentagon. That too requires the blessing of top appropriators. And, if the President wishes to retool the defense appropriations bill, he also must earn approval from leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee.\nThis tactic starts to test the Constitutional limits of Article I, Section 9, granting Congress the authority to spend money how it sees fit. But what happens if administration starts to shift money Congress appropriations bills? This definitely pushes the limits of what is generally accepted and could run afoul of Article 1, Section 9. There would be a question as to which branch of government really has control over spending. Lawmakers from both parties may balk at this.\nAlso, Trump only has $750 million in transfer authority available within the DHS bill. So, he\u2019d have to rob Peter to pay Paul, moving money between appropriations bills. Moreover, all of those programs from which the President wants to shift money have supporters in Congress from both parties. Those lawmakers will bray if the money touches their pet program. The howls are even more dire if the President does it without Congressional dispensation.\n\u201cThe President is doing an end-run about Congress about the power of the purse,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\u201cThis is a terrible power grab, unprecedented in American history and would really upset the balance of power\u201d added House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY).\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) said that lawmakers would respond if"}

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, choices are state- or federal-based exchanges or a federal-state partnership.\nOn Friday, Bentley notified Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that he would not create a state-based health exchange or a state-federal partnership exchange because he said Alabama doesn't have the money to operate one. He estimated it would cost between $30 million and $50 million to operate an exchange.\nThat leaves a federal exchange, which Bentley said he believes cannot be set up.\nSince he once said he preferred a state exchange, Democrats accused Bentley of changing his mind for political purposes.\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert is questioning how a federal exchange would work after last week's decision by Sebelius to extend the exchange decision deadline to Dec. 14.\n\u201cWhile I appreciate the extension of the federal deadline for states to determine an appropriate course regarding an insurance exchange, there remain far too many unanswered questions about the federal alternative,\u201d Herbert wrote Sebelius.\nHe asked how much would it cost the state, taxpayers and the private sector for Utah to participate in a federal exchange and what ensures that a federal exchange accurately incorporates all state-specific procedures and laws, according to the Deseret News.\nBentley attended a Republican Governors Association meeting last week, where some governors said they would resist the Affordable Care Act.

Updated.\nBeef, water, isolated oat product, salt, chili pepper, onion powder, tomato powder, oats (wheat), soy lecithin, sugar, spices, maltodextrin (a polysaccharide that is absorbed as glucose), soybean oil (anti-dusting agent), garlic powder, autolyzed yeast extract, citric acid, caramel color, cocoa powder, silicon dioxide (anti-caking agent), natural flavors, yeast, modified corn starch, natural smoke flavor, salt, sodium phosphate, less than 2% of beef broth, potassium phosphate, and potassium lactate.\nIt looks bad but passable... until you learn that\u2014according to the Alabama law firm suing Taco Bell\u2014only 36% of that is beef. Thirty-six percent. The other 64% is mostly tasteless fibers, various industrial additives and some flavoring and coloring. Everything is processed into a mass that actually looks like beef, and packed into big containers labeled as \"taco meat filling.\" These containers get shipped to Taco Bell's outlets and cooked into something that looks like beef, is called beef and is advertised as beef by the fast food chain.\nCan you call beef something that looks like ground beef but it's 64% lots-of-other-stuff? Taco Bell thinks they can.\nThat's the reason why an Alabama law firm is presenting a class action lawsuit for false advertising\u2014they are not asking for any money\u2014saying that the fake Mexican food maker should label their processed clustermass of disgust as what it really is in all promotional materials, following USDA laws.

Of course, the All-New Double Decker with Two Times More Taco Meat Filling would not sound very good on TV.\nTaco Bell's meat filling looks like ground beef before and after cooking, but it has been augmented with fibers and other substances to keep the price low. That's how they can offer tacos for 99 cents\u2014and that's fine: There's absolutely nothing wrong with their processed mixture apart from being gross.\nThe problem here is that the consumers may believe that this \"meat filling\" is actually beef while it's not. If it looks like beef, it's labeled as beef, and it's advertised as beef, then it must be beef\u2014except that substance is not beef. It's just \"meat filling\".

Looks good,\" Vanek said.\nVanek, who makes his home about 20 minutes east of Xcel Energy Center in Stillwater, Minn., chose to take less money, over fewer years, to stay home and reap all the benefits that has to offer.\n\"It's beyond my wildest dreams,\" Vanek said. \"It's still hard to put into words.\"\nThe process that brought the forward to the Wild began last year. Offered a long-term contract extension by the New York Islanders, Vanek turned it down and instead chose to gamble on himself and perhaps a chance to return to the place he first came to in 2002 as a freshman at the University of Minnesota.\n\"This is a place I have spent a lot of time the last 10 years or so,\" Vanek said. \"What intrigued me the most was Zach [Parise] signing here and [Ryan] Suter signing here (prior to the 2012-13 season). This team was getting very good.\n\"About a year ago, when I made my decision to go to free agency, this was definitely a team I had in mind.\"\nComing off a seven-year contract worth $50 million he signed with the Buffalo Sabres in 2007, Vanek had several intriguing options when free agency began Tuesday, including one from the Islanders in an attempt to bring him back to New York, where he spent much of last season before being acquired by the Montreal Canadiens at the NHL Trade Deadline.\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say it was easy [turning down longer contracts],\" Vanek said. \"I really liked it on the Island and they were in the mix again today. I thought the line I played on there with John Tavares and Kyle Okposo was the best line I've been on. But at the end of the day, I made my decision and I'm not going to regret it.\"\nWhat made the decision easier for Vanek, a native Austrian, is the presence of his family. His wife Ashley is from the area, and their home in suburban St. Paul is where she and their three sons have lived while Vanek has been away. Last season, as he was shipped from Buffalo to Long Island in October then from Long Island to Montreal in March, Vanek said he realized how much he missed his family, admitting it may have played a role in a subpar Stanley Cup Playoff performance with the Canadiens.\n\"It certainly wasn't my best one,\" Vanek said of his playoffs. \"I'll take the blame for that. It's not always easy moving around and being away from my family like I have been. Those aren't excuses, those are just factors that factor in for me \u2026 family is big for me.\"\nAlso playing a role in bringing Vanek to Minnesota was Wild forward Jason Pominville, one of his best friends and a former Sabres teammate, who will start a five-year contract extension he signed in Minnesota a year ago. Defenseman Keith Ballard, with whom Vanek won a national championship with the Golden Gophers in 2003, played a behind-the-scenes role in selling the Wild.\n\"I didn't need much of a sales pitch,\" Vanek said. \"I remember when [Pominville] got traded here and he was, I wouldn't say disappointed, but shocked"}

To leave things where they were would have been like putting Band-Aids on open wounds.\n\"And most (such decisions) don't work,\" Stoddard acknowledged. \"But we think they will work.\"\nBy \"working,\" Stoddard did not mean he believed ABC had a chance of becoming the first-place network within one season. Rather, he looked at the network's bold changes as putting ABC on the right track.\nABC's car-crash, low-comedy days are over, Stoddard asserted. \"This year's shows are about something--they have more of a reality base,\" he said.\nStoddard, who has publicly treated ABC's recent dismal performance with his own wry brand of humor, continued in that vein. He joked that ABC's only goal for the 1987-88 season was \"Survival!\"\nStoddard joked that ABC executives \"weren't under any extraordinary drug pressure\" when moving \"20/20\" to Fridays. The decision had less to do with \"20/20\" than with promoting one of its movie nights. By switching Sunday night movies to Thursdays, Stoddard explained, the network could hype the movie during its strong Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday prime-time lineup, rather than during the weaker Thursday, Friday and Saturday schedule. He said he thought the \"20/20\" audience would follow the show to Friday.\nOn the renewal of some low-rated programs--including \"Max Headroom,\" \"The Charmings\" and \"Sledge Hammer!,\" which will compete with \"The Cosby Show\" on Thursday nights--Stoddard said that \"known quantities\" were easier to promote than new shows, especially in a competitive time slot.\nAnd, he added, ABC just didn't have enough strong shows available to replace all the weak ones. \"It would have been lovely to have 15 perfect shows, but we didn't,\" he said flatly.\nStoddard said he \"just didn't know\" if Dolly Parton could revive enough interest in the variety genre to put ABC back into the running on Sunday nights, but he thought that she could have the same warm audience appeal as Oprah Winfrey.\nStoddard said the network was also working on another pilot with Winfrey. (One has already been scrapped.) Other shows in the works as mid-season replacements include \"Clinic,\" from Jay Presson Allen, \"Pursuit of Happiness\" and \"It Had to Be You.\"\nAlthough two Aaron Spelling pilots were not picked up for fall, Stoddard said ABC plans to continue its long-standing relationship with Spelling, whose hits for ABC have included \"The Love Boat.\"\nIn the wake of the failure of the 14 1/2-hour \"Amerika\" miniseries--Stoddard's dream project of last season--he acknowledged that"}
{"idx": "19452", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Should Ventura County have a single fire department?\nWith more attention on fire in our daily lives, particularly with climate change, it is time to examine the need to restructure our fire service.\nFire \u2014 it\u2019s been the focus of our attention for the past couple of years. The Thomas Fire, wildfires all over the West, Santa Paula\u2019s turnover of fire service to the county, Ventura\u2019s budget negotiations with its fire department \u2014 fire is an ever-present story. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to add a little more fuel to this fire discussion.\nSeveral years ago, Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters wrote an opinion piece discussing how, with the increases in wildfires in California and mutual aid arrangements, more and more city fire departments were siphoning off their own resources to aid those firefights.\nMeanwhile, at a couple of state Local Agency Formation Commission conferences a few years ago, there were panels discussing how several counties around the state were consolidating their fire departments into a single agency. Maybe it\u2019s time to begin that discussion here.\nWith Santa Paula joining the Ventura County Fire Department, the recent budget scrutiny over the city of Ventura\u2019s expenditure for fire department requests, and the continued need for the city of Oxnard to stabilize its budget, is it time to finally look at one countywide fire service?\nI raise this issue for several reasons. One, with the increase in wildfires, it seems there is a constant hit on city resources to help the county and state departments fight these fires.\nTwo, particularly in the case of Ventura, much more of its fire department\u2019s time is spent responding to medical emergencies than actually fighting fires.\nAnd three, during budget negotiations, firefighter unions have a way of playing cities off each other to boost their pay and benefits by threatening to jump to a neighbor city. City of Santa Paula firefighters would threaten to go to Ventura because the pay and benefits were better. Ventura firefighters would threaten to leave for Oxnard because the pay and benefits were better. And so on.\nThe arguments for a single, consolidated fire service in Ventura County \u2014 an expanded county fire department, if you will \u2014 is that it would eliminate this game of budgetary Chinese checkers, allow one complete organization to move its pieces around the game board however it saw fit as opposed to mutual aid responses, and possibly free up or expand medical emergency response teams within the cities for that singular purpose.\nI realize Ventura and Oxnard have longstanding, proud traditions with their city fire departments and recognize their contributions over the years. But times have changed, and perhaps it is time to examine a new model for fire service. For better, seamless customer service and good government, the discussion is at least worth having.\nIf Oxnard and Ventura were absorbed into a countywide fire district, it could reduce the tugs on city budgets and provide greater flexibility in moving firefighting resources around to areas of greatest need.\nToday, because of mutual aid, dispatching and the \u201cclosest to\u201d policy for responses, the city of Ventura is, de facto, already in the county system. Additionally, there are economies of scale. The city uses the county\u2019s training facilities and special equipment all the time. A consolidated force would simply remove one step in between.\nCreating such an expanded department would not be easy, but it is doable. There are already examples around the state.\nOne big concern would be the financial structure. Would a joint powers agreement and governing commission representing all 10 cities and the county, so rates and expenditures could be set in a"}

One aviation source said that a fire on board would likely have generated multiple warning signals, while a sudden explosion may not have generated any.\nThe army spokesman published pictures on Saturday on its official Facebook page of the recovered items, which included blue debris with EgyptAir markings, seat fabric with designs in the airline\u2019s colours, and a yellow lifejacket.\nIt was the third blow since October to Egypt\u2019s travel industry, still reeling from political unrest following the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak.\nA suspected Islamic State bombing brought down a Russian airliner after it took off from Sharm el-Sheikh airport in late October, killing all 224 people on board, and an EgyptAir plane was hijacked in March by a man wearing a fake suicide belt.\n\u201cThese messages do not allow in any way to say what may have caused smoke or fire on board the aircraft,\u201d said a spokesman for the French BEA agency, which is assisting an official Egyptian investigation.\nHe added that the priority now was to find the two flight recorders, containing cockpit voice recordings and data readings, from the Airbus A320 which vanished from radar early on Thursday.\nThe flight data was sent through an automatic system called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which routinely downloads maintenance and fault data to the airline operating the aircraft.\nAviation website Aviation Herald published a burst of seven messages broadcast over the space of three minutes. These included alarms about smoke in the lavatory as well as the aircraft\u2019s avionics area, which sits under the cockpit.\nWhile suggesting a possible fire, the relatively short sequence of data gives no insight into pilot efforts to control the aircraft, nor does it show whether it fell in one piece or disintegrated in mid-air, two aviation safety experts said.\nThe aircraft was carrying 56 passengers, including a child and two infants, and 10 crew, EgyptAir said on Thursday. They included 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, along with citizens of 10 other countries.\nFrench foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was due to meet relatives of passengers in Paris on Saturday.\nEgypt\u2019s navy, with help from French and other vessels, was searching an area north of Alexandria, just south of where the signal from the plane was lost early on Thursday.\nEgyptAir chairman Safwat Moslem told state television that the radius of the search zone was 40 miles, giving an area of 5,000 square miles, but said it may be expanded.\nA European satellite spotted a 2 km-long oil slick in the Mediterranean, about 40 km southeast of the aircraft\u2018s last known position, the European Space Agency said."}

(WTVF) \u2014 Nashville is currently seeking proposals from private companies to help modernize its on-street parking operations.\nThe winning bidder will get the right to operate, enforce and even expand the current street parking, although the Metro Parking and Traffic Commission would have to approve any new meters.\nThe deal could mean as much as $34 million for the city over the next two years, but it also means it will soon cost more to park your car.\nNashville is booming and parking is expensive.\nParking downtown can often run as much as 30 dollars for two hours.\nNow Metro is hoping to cash in -- looking for help with its budget problems.\n\"What we are proposing here is new to Nashville but it is not new in the world of parking management,\" Skip Stitt, a Metro consultant recently told the Parking and Traffic Commission.\nHe is one of 5 consultants Metro hired to help the city evaluate proposals from private companies to take over metered parking in Nashville. Metro has put out a Request for Quotations seeking a private company that would pay millions up front for the right to administer and profit Nashville's street parking.\n\"This is about more than just meters it's really about putting Nashville on a path to being a 21st century modern city,\" said Brian Kelsey, the Mayor's Chief Strategy Officer.\nSpeaking to the Parking and Transportation Committee earlier this month, Kelsey recommended that the commission approve big changes to Nashville's metered parking -- so it will be more attractive for a private company.\nThose changes include - eliminating free parking on Sundays and extending the hours of operation until 10pm every day. Currently meters stop charging after 6pm.\nThe commission also voted to recommend raising rates by 25 cents an hour with future increases connected to the consumer price index. And they recommended the Metro Council approve sharp increases to parking fines, more than doubling the current $11 fine when the meter runs out, up to 25 dollars for future violations.\nBut the biggest changes are likely to happen in places like Five Points in East Nashville where you may no longer be able to park for free.\nThese streets and the streets around it will likely be getting new meters. And It's a scene that will play out all across the city.\nOther areas likely to see meters are streets in and around the 12th South business district , portions of Midtown and large parts of Germantown will no longer have free street parking. Overall the city could more than double the number of meters in the city.\n\"We're expanding the footprint drastically on where these meters can go,\" said Metro Councilman Steve Glover. He says he was shocked when he saw the areas where a private vendor could start putting meters.\n\"We're going to get a boatload of phone calls from people that are mad. They're going to be mad as a hornet because now they are going to have to start paying for parking on the street they were not used to paying for parking for,\" said Glover.\nMetro is asking for 17 million dollars for each of the first two years of a 30 year contract. It would then share in the parking revenues after the first two years.\n\"A short term gain for the city and a long term loss for the taxpayers,\" said Glover.\nGlover also worries the city is making a bad deal.

An expert who has been sounding an alarm over the growing reliance by the United States on Chinese-made medicines said this is just another case highlighting the extensive problems of pharmaceuticals made in China.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced on July 13 the recall of 29 types of single and 51 types of combination valsartan medicines.\nThe recall followed the same move by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on July 5 when it was informed by China\u2019s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical\u2014a major global manufacturer of generic valsartan\u2014that the drug had been contaminated by a substance called N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which could cause cancer.\nValsartan contamination could have started as early as 2012 according to European regulators, who speculated that it was caused by Zhejiang Huahai changing its manufacturing processes at that time. This also means that for six years, a large number of patients worldwide likely have been exposed to the cancer-causing element in their valsartan.\nZhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical did not respond to The Epoch Times\u2019 repeated requests for comment. The company, which sold $50 million worth of valsartan in 2017 alone, acknowledged in a public statement that some of its valsartan was definitely contaminated, although it did not give out any additional details.\nRosemary Gibson, a senior adviser at The Hastings Center and an author of several books on health care issues, told The Epoch Times that the case is just the latest scandal showing how defective medicines and pharmaceutical ingredients made by Chinese manufacturers are becoming a health care hazard and even a national security threat for the United States.\nAccording to the annual report by U.S.\u2013China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), China has been a prolific source of counterfeit and defective medicine. The Chinese regime\u2019s regulators have proven to be incapable of cracking down on bad medicines, and many Chinese consumers prefer U.S. pharmaceutical products due to concerns over the quality of domestic ones.\nZhejiang Huahai was one of the first Chinese companies to be approved to sell generic drugs in the United States, and it remains one of China\u2019s largest exporters of pharmaceuticals to the U.S. and European markets.\nGibson said the problem was not limited to Zhejiang Huahai. The valsartan contamination highlights the general issues of quality and consumer protection for Americans who rely on generic drugs manufactured by China, she said.\nChina has been rapidly expanding its pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and is now the maker of thousands of drugs found in U.S. hospitals and pharmacies. It could soon overtake India as the dominant manufacturer of generic drugs in the United States.\nAccording to Gibson, the growing reliance on medicines made in China poses a national security hazard for America. The United States has locked into a strategic competition with the Chinese regime, which is adopting increasingly aggressive foreign policies and military expansions.\nIn an exclusive interview with The Epoch Times in May, Rosemary Gibson discussed her new book \u201cChina RX: Exposing the Risks of America\u2019s Dependence on China for Medicine,\u201d co-authored with Janardan Prasad Singh, which documented what has led to China\u2019s increasing dominance in the manufacturing of medicine and the consequences for the United States and the world"}

But Khartoum was not let off the hook.\nOn May 15, the Security Council passed a resolution supporting the peace deal and giving Khartoum an ultimatum: allow the UN advance team to visit Darfur within seven days to conduct surveys in preparation for the deployment of UN peace keepers or else. However, the international mediators still have a fight on their hands.\nThe agreement allows the rebel movements to nominate one person for the position a \"senior assistant to the president\" and that of governor of one of Darfur\u2019s three states.\nThe rebels were not happy with that, they were incensed because the deal did not install a vice-president from Darfur. They also wanted a guarantee for their full control over the region, which they also insisted should be reunified.\nThe determination of other countries to force a deal may be also related to the recent threats made by Osama bin Laden to shift his al-Qaeda operations to Sudan, and Darfur in particular.\nThey also wanted the Sudanese government to commit to full individual compensation for war victims, rather than just setting up a fund for this purpose.\nHowever, strong pressure was put on the rebels to sign the deal worked out by the African Union mediators and their American and European partners.\nAn international team led by Robert Zoellick, the US deputy secretary of state, and Hilary Benn, Britain's international development minister, arrived in Abuja as the deadline was drawing closer and arms were being twisted.\nAlpha Omar Kunari, head of the AU commission, and Denis Sassou-Nguesso, AU chairman and president of Congo, were among some African and international key players who put a pressure on the rebels to sign.\nThis stance appeared to mark a shift in the attitude of foreign powers, which had been seen as sympathetic to the rebel cause and antagonistic to the government. However, this view might be based on a misunderstanding.\nMany countries have indeed been very hostile to the government, and some parties (the US and some human rights groups) even accuse it of presiding over genocide in Darfur, allegedly by backing the nomadic Janjawid militias accused of instigating mass killing against Darfur's Africans.\nThis antagonism does not necessarily translate into sympathy to the rebel cause. Some observers were dismayed by the timing of the rebellion, which spoilt for many the intended celebration of the ending to Africa\u2019s longest-running civil war in 2004.\nThey were also critical of the rebels' tactics, and regarded many of their demands as unrealistic and even a threat to the so-called Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) which ended the war in the south.\nThese misgivings were overshadowed by the international outcry over the government\u2019s disproportionate reaction to the rebellion by arming and unleashing of Janjawid, which added fuel to the intra-Darfur civil war.\nThe government of"}

But not just any pitch competition -- one that allowed multiple founders to engage with investors and grow their businesses through those conversations.\nDenholder is the founder of Next Chapter Ventures, a Hong Kong-based crowdfunding platform for women entrepreneurs, and Batra is an associate at Q Venture Partners and the founder of Dock@Work. Along with WHub, Next Chapter and Dock@Work co-hosted Pitch Like a Girl as a satellite of RISE on Wednesday evening. Of the 57 applications they received, the hosts selected 10 startups to pitch investors in a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style platform.\nThe teams hailed from Hong Kong, New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia, and came from industries as varied as fintech, health and wellness, education and fashion and beauty. One hundred fifty people attended the event, and the Facebook Live stream had 5,100 views, according to Denholder and Batra. They said holding the event in conjunction with RISE was a natural fit, as the conference has made efforts to be inclusive and make the event accessible to more women. It was also an optimal time to draw attention to high-potential, women-led companies in the region, given the audience the conference attracts.\nDenholder, Batra and their partners achieved their goal of holding a unique pitch competition, said Bhavneet Chahal, whose company GoSkills was one of four selected for further investor conversations. GoSkills offers bite-sized, on-demand business courses for professionals looking to enhance their existing skills or make a career change.\nThe company currently boasts 90,000 users and has earned $1.5 million in revenue, according to Chahal. She and her 10-team person team, which is distributed in Indonesia, the U.S. and New Zealand, have bootstrapped the company up to this point. But she saw Pitch Like a Girl as an opportunity to bring investors on board. Chahal said she was also drawn to the competition by its emphasis on creating opportunities for women founders.\n\u201cThe audience for Pitch Like a Girl was different, it really catered for women in tech and the buzz and excitement in the audience was palpable,\u201d she said. Chahal said it can be challenging for founders in the Asia-Pacific region to find investors with a track record of backing women-led businesses. But she sees this as an opportunity for both entrepreneurs and investors, especially given that startups that have women on their founding teams outperform their all-male counterparts by 63%.\nSamar Shaheryar echoed Chahal\u2019s take on the atmosphere surrounding the competition. \u201cThe energy in the room was so different from other startup events. Supportive and collaborative, not competitive,\u201d she said. Shaheryar\u2019s ecommerce company, Baby Hero, sells baby clothes made with organic, fair trade-sourced material. For every item sold, Baby Hero donates newborn survival toolkits to mothers in rural parts of Pakistan and Kenya as part of its mission to reduce infant mortality rates in the developing world.\nShaheryar said 60% of Baby Hero\u2019s sales come from the U.S. and that the majority of customers live in developed nations. She sees the social aspect of Baby Hero bridging the gap between consumers in wealthy countries and mothers and infants in less privileged parts of the world.\nShaheryar said"}

Weekend Edition's literary detective Paul Collins tracks that war's progress in his new book, The Murder of the Century.\nIn 1897, New York was a town of many newspapers in which the New York World, the New York Journal, the New York Herald, the New York Post and more competed for the public eye.\nIn summer of 1897, a group of New York kids found a headless torso floating in the East River. At first, the police thought it was a prank being played by medical students, who were known to leave cadaver fingers and limbs lying around just for laughs. But the next day, the lower torso and hips of that beheaded half-corpse washed up along the Harlem River, and it became clear that the wounds were the work of a malicious amateur.\nWho cracked the case? Who scrambled facts, myth and suspicion through that boiling New York summer?\nAccording to Weekend Edition's literary detective Paul Collins, it was Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, two newspapers that took a summer murder and turned it into one of the first great newspaper wars.\nCollins tracks the progress of that war in a new book, The Murder of the Century: The Gilded Age Crime That Scandalized a City & Sparked the Tabloid Wars. He tells NPR's Scott Simon that the papers were actually quite helpful in solving the case.\nHe says New York World reporter Ned Brown provided one of the case's big breaks when he noticed an anomaly: The recovered body was very muscular, but the hands were smooth.\n\"It didn't seem like someone who was doing what one would usually associate with manual labor and [Brown] eventually realized that where he had seen that was actually in the bathhouses in New York, with the masseurs who really had to put a lot of physical effort in but they kept their skin quite soft,\" Collins says. \"And he started asking around at some of the bathhouses if any of their employees were missing.\"\nIn fact, one employee was missing. His name was William Guldensuppe and his death was eventually attributed to his lover, Augusta Nack, and Martin Thorn, a rival for Nack's affections.\nAnd while the World managed to provide the first big break, the Journal aided in its first big arrest.\n\"The first arrest in the case was basically attempted by two Hearst reporters who jumped onto a moving carriage on Ninth Avenue,\" Collins says. \"As it turned out, they actually needed a policeman to back them up ... they weren't really that good at arresting people.\"\nThe struggle to beat the other paper to the story also led to new journalistic practices, many of which are still used today. Take, for example, Hearst's \"wrecking crew\" or what we think of today as team reporting.\n\"What Hearst figured out was if you sent 10 [or] 20 people onto the scene; if you had artists there; if you had people interviewing members of the crowd \u2014 families, any expert that they could grab \u2014 you could not only generate one big story, you could generate five or six and spread them across the entire front page,\" Collins says. \"So he really pioneered this approach of blitzing a story.\"\nMeanwhile, Pulitzer was pushing the idea"}

He added that his holiday shopping list includes clothes for his daughter who is away at college.\nAmong shoppers with a college education, for example, the unemployment rate is about 5 percent; for those without a high school diploma, it\u2019s 16 percent. Wages for upper-income consumers are rising; for those at the bottom, they\u2019re falling. The average bonus on Wall Street could top last year's level \u2014 both because profits are up and because there are fewers bankers and brokers left with jobs to split the bonus pot.\nThat gap is showing up in the bottom lines of American retailers, some of which generate as much as half their annual profits from the holiday season. Though retail sales are expected to show healthy gains of 4 to 5 percent this year, retailers who cater to households at the bottom of the economic ladder are seeing very different results as their customers struggle to make ends meet.\nA weaker dollar is also helping to boost shopping traffic from overseas tourists coming to the U.S.\nIn the U.S., discount shoppers \"are focusing on necessities and being practical in how they're spending their money,\" Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, told a conference call last month.\nLuxury retailers, on the other hand, are having their best year since the bottom fell out of the financial markets in 2008.\nWealthier consumers with stock market investments have good reason to feel like spending this holiday season. In the third quarter, household net worth bulged by $1.2 trillion, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve. The gain was largely due to a $1.9 trillion rise in the value of financial assets as the stock market staged a major rally off its summer lows.\nFree-spending, high-end consumers are also helping fatten the bottom lines of stores specializing in luxury brands. While households at the bottom of the ladder on tight budgets are squeezing every dollar by looking for the most aggressive mark-downs, high-end shoppers are apparently more inclined to pay full price.\nOnline retailers are also reporting strong demand. Overall sales are up 12 percent over last year to more than $17.5 billion so far this year, according to figures released this week by research firm comScore. The gain is coming from the number of people shopping online and the amount they\u2019re are willing to spend, according to Susan Lyne CEO of Gilt Groupe, an online store that specializes in luxury brands.\nTraffic at shopping centers has also rebounded strongly from last year, especially among those malls with stores catering to wealthier shoppers.\nThe miserable housing market is another big reason lower-income consumers aren\u2019t in a spending mood. Households with little or no investment in stocks and bonds are getting squeezed by falling housing prices, eliminating what little equity they may have left in their homes.

Not according to new stats from BayStreet Research, which finds that while unlocked phone sales are booming in the US, the most popular handsets are from Samsung.\nSamsung&apos;s $720 unlocked price for the Galaxy S9, which undercuts all US wireless carriers except T-Mobile, has boosted the unlocked share of the US market from 12 to 14 percent, said BayStreet&apos;s founding partner, Cliff Maldonado. Still, that&apos;s the biggest shift in the unlocked share of the market we&apos;ve seen in a few years.\n\"Unlocked phones\" are generally those sold outside carrier stores, which can be easily switched between carriers. The unlocked, direct-sales version of the Galaxy S9, like the Galaxy S8 and recent iPhones, supports all four major US carriers. But the vast majority of US smartphones are sold through carriers on monthly payment plans, often with no money down; for unlocked phones, consumers usually pay the full cost up front.\n\"[S9 sales at] carriers are down, but Samsung direct online is up really big. People are finally willing to buy the phone outright,\" he said.\nSo far, though, there&apos;s no sign Samsung&apos;s unlocked success is leading to Americans reaching out for a broader range of unlocked devices. A truly disruptively priced new flagship, like a $350 OnePlus 6, could upset the market, Maldonado said, but the latest rumors have OnePlus&apos;s new phone costing more, not less than previous models.\n\"Is it 12 to 14 [percent] and then it stops, or does it keep going? I don&apos;t know that,\" Maldonado said. \"Anyone who comes out of the open market, even though we&apos;re seeing some nice inflection points, it&apos;s going to be a stretch,\" he said.\nUS smartphone owners are holding onto their phones for longer and longer now, because carriers are no longer heavily discounting phones to promote two-year contracts. Rather, consumers are paying on monthly equipment installment plans. When their installment plans end, they see their monthly bills drop, which doesn&apos;t give them an incentive to take on a new phone and another installment plan. According to Maldonado, Sprint customers now upgrade phones every two years, and T-Mobile customers take three years.\nCarriers are willing to pay to steal customers from other carriers, but that leaves phone upgraders\u2014and the phone makers who want to sell them devices\u2014in the lurch.\n\"In a world where the carriers aren&apos;t focused on upgrades [but] on new adds, the handset guys lose,\" Maldonado said.\nPhone sales could heat up again in 2019, Maldonado agreed, if carriers decide to push devices that support 5G. All four US carriers have said they&apos;ll be launching mobile 5G next year, and it will require new phones.\n\"Q2 is going to be a disaster for units [sold,]\" he said. \"There&apos;s going to be a lull in handset sales until the iPhone in the fall.\""}

Maybe you are a self-employed freelancer.

Or that if you do, they might order you to shut down.\nHere's the deal: while every base and housing company has its own rules and regulations about what can and can't be done as a business in housing, most of them require that you get the housing company's blessing. For example, at Fort Campbell only breeding and selling animals is specifically prohibited, but at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii they prohibit any type of salon or sale of food made in your home (a bummer if you like to make and sell cakes, for example). The only rule that seems to be universally followed across bases is for in-home childcare: if you are going to provide it, you must be registered with the base.\nBut the bigger problem is this: your business could be banned from operating on base if it is competition with anything the Exchange or MWR does or could offer. Exchange officials are able to give the final \"yes\" or \"no\" to home-based businesses. And while there is a way for the base commander to override that decision, it's not likely.\nRegistering childcare makes a lot of sense from a health and safety perspective. So does banning purposeful animal breeding. But forcing spouses to register their Pampered Chef business? Or small photography business? ... only to risk being not allowed to run it?

Go read the Trib and Observer liveblogs, and check the StadWithWendy Twitter hashtag. I spent more time on Twitter last night than I had in the previous six months combined.\nIt should be noted that the Senate had other business to attend besides SB5 yesterday.\nA proposal from Senate Transportation Chairman Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, that raises nearly $1 billion annually for state road construction and maintenance is within striking distance of heading to Texas voters for approval. Senate Joint Resolution 2 would ask voters to approve amending the state constitution to divert half of the oil and gas severance taxes currently earmarked for the Rainy Day Fund to the State Highway Fund. The measure passed the House Monday after House Transportation Chairman Larry Phillips, R-Sherman, amended it to, in part, address concerns about the Rainy Day Fund\u2019s future. Under the amendment, severance tax revenue would only be diverted from the Rainy Day Fund for roads in years when the fund has a balance of at least one-third of its legislative cap, a figure that varies over time. If senators approve the changes Tuesday, the proposed constitutional amendment will be placed on the November ballot. Nichols has requested that the Senate take up the measure before SB 5, the abortion bill, to ensure that a possible filibuster doesn\u2019t doom both bills.\nDespite Sen. Nichols\u2019 request, SB5 was first on the agenda. As such, both it and SB23, the bill dealing with capitol murder sentencing for 17-year-olds, also were snuffed out by the filibuster and the ensuing chaos. Make no mistake, putting them behind SB5 was by design, so that if Rick Perry needed to order double overtime, he could blame the unfinished business on those nefarious Democrats. I\u2019m sure Dan Patrick would be happy to go along with that.\nSen. Davis successfully talked for 11 straight hours, without stopping or even pausing for more than a few seconds, without eating or drinking or relieving herself or leaning on anything, before the farcical third ruling that she was talking about something not germane to SB5. (She was talking about sonograms, which of course have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with abortion and its restrictions in this state.) It\u2019s a massively tall order, and from the beginning it likely would have been for naught, at least if stopping SB5 were the only goal. We all know that the Republicans hold the cards. Rick Perry can order another special session five minutes after this one ends, and without redistricting to clog the calendar a bill like SB5 would pass with plenty of time to spare. But some fights aren\u2019t about whether you win or lose, they\u2019re about whether you fought or rolled over. Say what else you want, Democrats didn\u2019t roll over. Wendy Davis sure as hell didn\u2019t roll over.

The Jays, as every baseball fan in this country is aware, struggled mightily last season and finished last in the AL East. Not that it was by choice but the Jays return essentially the same team this year and this time those same experts have the Jays finishing last.\nDarlings last year and dregs this year. The positives that were trumpeted last off-season are now seen as negatives. The Jays are aware that they are thought of as a mediocre club likely destined for a finish similar to last year but the organization, the players and the coaches are determined to prove that last season was an anomaly\u2014that the club is closer to last year\u2019s expectations than this year\u2019s predictions. Even ownership\u2019s marketing program deals with the seeking of retribution for last season\u2019s misery.\nThe Blue Jays organization believes that injuries were the main culprit for last season\u2019s epic failure. The club lost more than 1600 man games to injury\u2014the most in major league baseball\u2014and had their projected starting line-up on the field for only seven games. They forecast that this year would be completely different once they were able to field the same line-up for longer than a weekend series. But will it?\nThe main concern entering this season is the starting rotation. I have maintained that the Jays can not compete against the powerhouses of the AL East with a rotation consisting of merely average starters. The club does not have an ace\u2014no pitcher they can count on to end a losing streak. In fact the Jays have five middling starters who would be middle or bottom of the rotation on a good team\u2014if they were part of the rotation at all.\nRA Dickey again showed in the season opener that he is not an ace and that the New York Mets were wise in dealing the knuckleballer at his highest value. Dickey had progressed over the three previous years culminating in his Cy Young season in 2011 when his knuckleball was unhittable. Unfortunately for the Jays Dickey is now regressing\u2014he is no longer a dominant starter.\nDickey can still string together innings and can still win more than he loses but he rarely dominates.\nDavid Price is an ace and he dominated the Jays on opening day. Jon Lester is an ace and he dominated the Orioles on opening day. The Rays and the Red Sox are the two best teams in the division because of the strength and the depth of their rotations. The Rays talk about run prevention as their modus operandi. While the Red Sox still like to thump they succeed because of their pitching. The Jays cannot compete with the number of mid-rotation types they run out to the mound.\nSo the Jays are classified this season as dregs\u2014is that accurate? Couldn\u2019t the Jays be forgiven for thinking that last season\u2019s mess was indeed caused by injuries, and couldn\u2019t their belief that it is unlikely to happen again be valid? Of course when considering the Jays lost more than 1300 man games in 2012 is it reasonable to assume that this club will never be healthy?\nThe Jays lose closer Casey Janssen before opening day die to back tightness and they lose star shortstop Jose Reyes on opening day due to a hamstring strain.

The first phase of the Expo Line is currently under construction from downtown Los Angeles to Culver City. The PUC has already signed off on 36 of 38 street crossings on the line, but two crossings still need approval -- one outside the Foshay Learning Center and the other outside Dorsey High School. Both are in South Los Angeles.\nThe gist of the issue is that the Expo Line Construction Authority, which is building the project, says street-level crossings will be safe, while the Los Angeles Unified School District and some residents say the train will pose a danger to students. Here's a link to a recent Times story that looks at the dispute.\nThe reason that the PUC's decision is a big deal is that it will determine how the line will be built at the two crossings. It could uphold an earlier proposed decision by a PUC judge to build pedestrian bridges, or it could allow the street crossings. It could also demand that the train be put in a trench at both sites or on bridges. The construction authority is saying anything besides street-level crossings will consume more time and money that it currently doesn't have."}

I realize that some people like it, but it is still green Jell-O with carrot shavings in it.\nLet's imagine you are a graduate student in the future who can only get a Ph.D. by reading Tuesday night's remarks. (This is the only reason I can imagine that anyone in the future would read it.) What principles and ideas would it convey?\nThe packaging \u2014 the call for healing and unity \u2014 is a very typical Trumpian ploy. His outreach will last only until there is some black athlete to bully, some woman to demean, some tragedy useful to feed ethnic prejudice. Anyone who entertains the notion that President Trump might be sincere should have the word \"sucker\" tattooed on his or her forehead for cable news purposes.\nThe largest chunk of the speech was devoted to his immigrant obsession. With Trump, when you strip away all the hatred and fearmongering, there is always another layer of hatred and fearmongering beneath. But why give the wall and immigration such prominence? It is hard to picture a political consultant saying to Trump: \"Your majesty, I think we should try the same message that was repudiated decisively in the 2018 midterm election and is ruining the Republican brand for a generation. The 79th time always does the trick.\"\nNo, Trump is actually pushing against the views of a majority of the American people. Does this indicate that it is a matter of principle? This is hard to imagine, since Trump once attacked presidential candidate Mitt Romney for being too tough on immigrants shortly after the 2012 election. Trump has no ideology that would reliably predict any view on this matter.\nFirst, he probably thinks he will be judged as a loser if he leaves office without substantial progress on the wall. And he would be judged a loser. Democrats know this, and have the upper hand.\nSecond, the enthusiasm of his political base may be the only thing that stands between him and impeachment. Some elected Republicans would happily turn against Trump if they were not in abject fear of angering the GOP base. So Trump must keep the base happy at all costs.\nOther parts of Trump's speech were incoherent \u2014 or at least dependent on Google being broken down. He claims he wants high levels of legal immigration, even though he has proposed to slash legal immigration. He called for action on AIDS and childhood cancer, though he once proposed an 18 percent cut for the National Institutes of Health. He attacked partial-birth abortion, even though he once supported the procedure. And when Trump issues a call to bipartisanship, it is like a murderer speaking at the funeral of his victim.\nYet \u2014 and actually a pretty big yet \u2014 there were rays of light, made even brighter by the utter darkness surrounding them. Trump's calls to defeat AIDS and fight childhood cancer are truly admirable. On AIDS in particular, the combination of early treatment (which reduces infection) and PrEP (which protects from infection) are making the end of AIDS a realistic goal. Cities such as Washington and San Francisco have shown that, by focusing interventions in the \"hot spots\" of new infection, rapid progress is possible. Trying to do the same on a national level is a very good idea."}

From a business standpoint, the Weather Channel is best summed up as an efficient vehicle to sell prescription drugs to older men. A whopping 73 percent of its primetime viewers this year are over the age of 50.

A federal RES would create 274,000 additional jobs in the renewable electricity industry. But there\u2019s a caveat \u2014 Congress would have to enact a 25 percent RES in order to create those jobs.\nBut even the House-passed climate and energy bill didn\u2019t meet that goal. That bill requires 20 percent to come from renewables by 2020, but it would allow 5 percent of the requirement be met through efficiency measures rather than new renewable capacity. The House bill would also allows governors to petition for a weaker standard if they don\u2019t believe their states can meet the target. It originally had a higher standard, but moderate Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee negotiated it down.\nThe Senate version currently in legislative purgatory sets the target even lower, requiring utilities to draw just 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources or energy-efficiency measures by 2021. Up to a quarter of that can be met through efficiency.\nThe RES Alliance argues that the bill\u2019s targets should be raised to 12 percent in 2014, 20 percent in 2020, and 25 percent in 2025, purely from renewables like wind, solar, and biomass. Clean-power advocates note that more ambitious near-term goals are particularly vital to boosting the industry and creating new jobs. The lower figures under consideration in Congress won\u2019t generate many new jobs beyond the trajectory the industry is already on without a federal standard, they argue. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia already have an RES in place.\nThe study, conducted by Navigant Consulting, finds that every state in the country would see some job growth with a higher RES in place. Some states might gain under 2,500 jobs, but some could gain up to 20,000. Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Tennessee, Texas, and Colorado are expected to see the biggest growth in new jobs. Fifty-two percent of those jobs would be in manufacturing, 23 percent in construction and trades, and 11 percent in engineering and professional technical services, meaning it could create both blue collar jobs and jobs for college graduates with technical skills."}

We must never forget those we lost. We must never drop our defenses. We must be ever diligent. It is not a time that allows for much nuance or interpretation.\nAs individuals, though, we don't require the arbitrary turning of a day on the calendar to trigger our memories. Memories have a life of their own, especially memories of horrific events like Sept. 11, 2001, and they force themselves on us at the oddest times.\nOne friend forever changed his life after being at ground zero that late summer day. He left investment banking for the world of first responders, becoming an emergency medical technician. When I asked him to share his thoughts on the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks, his reply was simple, yet poignant. \"I'm living the dream. I have 9/11 in a place where I'd like to keep it.\" Enough said.\nThen I turned to Tony Dajer, another friend whose life changed that day. We had met many years ago, the way so many people do in Greenwich and other suburban towns: our children went to elementary school together.\nTony works with the memories of 9/11 every day. He speaks of them with a studied calmness, one that has served him well over his years practicing emergency medicine. Ten years ago today, Dajer was the attending physician running the emergency room at NYU Downtown Hospital, the trauma center closest to ground zero. The facility is now known as New York Downtown Hospital.\nThe Harvard- and NYU-educated physician had prepared his whole professional life for a day like 9/11. When the call came into the hospital announcing a jetliner had crashed into a building in lower Manhattan, Dajer knew what had to be done in the 10 minutes before the first wave of casualties arrived.\n\"We had no idea of the enormity of what happened, but we knew to expect a massive, sudden inflow of civilian casualties,\" Dajer said.\nJust two months earlier he had led the ER staff through a disaster-preparedness drill. He knew they were ready. But he didn't know that his hospital, the smallest one in Manhattan, would treat 1,500 shocked and injured people during the next 24 hours.\nWhen the doctors, nurses and support staff were in place, Dajer took his post outside the hospital's Gold Street entrance where he would meet the arriving ambulances and perform triage, a method of prioritizing patient treatment. He quickly examined every dust-covered, fully clothed patient, searching for the injuries that demanded immediate attention, letting the less seriously injured wait a little longer for treatment.\nIn those first few minutes, Dajer saw horrific burns and injuries. Then things got even worse.\n\"We heard a humongous roar. I thought another jet had crashed. But then we were suddenly engulfed in a dust cloud. It was so thick, so dense. It completely blocked out the sun. I literally could not see my hand in front of my face.\"\nThe first tower had collapsed. Being a doctor, the first thing Dajer thought about was how to keep an area sterile enough to protect the injured. \"Do I close the hospital? How do I keep conditions sanitary?\"\nFortunately, NYU Downtown had inner and outer entrance doors, so the staff quickly turned them into a makeshift airlock.

While students often bemoan distribution requirements, these courses are crucial in guaranteeing that each one of us is exposed to a wide range of disciplines and ways of thinking. Sure, the system is not perfect, but requirements ensure that, by the time we walk through the FitzRandolph Gate, we will have had at least some practice reading literature, conducting science experiments and speaking a foreign language. This is certainly a worthy goal, and the requirements do a decent job of meeting it.\nBut the system is not perfect, and there are some ways it could be improved. A good place to start is with the Literature and the Arts requirement. The Board believes that, as it stands, the LA requirement is too broad. Instead, the LA requirement should be split into two separate requirements so that each student would take at least one course in literature and at least one in the arts, instead of two courses within this large category.\nUnder the current requirements, it is possible for a student to graduate from Princeton without ever having studied a piece of fiction or explored a work of art. The objective of distribution requirements is to ensure a well-rounded education, but the structure of the LA requirement undermines this because it allows students to take just arts courses or just literature courses. We believe that while literature and the arts are related, they are sufficiently different and offer students different critical skills, making them independently important. The skills that a student uses to analyze a text are certainly not the same ones that a student uses to critique a painting or a symphony; both skills are important components of a liberal arts education.\nBy splitting the current LA requirement into a literature requirement and an arts requirement, the University could further ensure that all students receive a comprehensive education without placing an extra burden on their schedules. In the past, two LA courses were required, so the number of distribution courses necessary for graduation would not change. In addition, both literature and arts courses can be found across a variety of departments, so selecting appealing courses that fulfill these requirements would not be difficult. The arts requirement, for example, could certainly be fulfilled in the art and archaeology department, but many courses in music, visual arts, dance and theater would also be satisfactory. And while literature may seem to indicate a course in the English department, there are dozens of courses in journalism, comparative literature, creative writing, American studies and East Asian studies that include significant literature components.\nUnlike the core curriculum present at some schools, Princeton\u2019s distribution requirements allow students a great deal of flexibility in choosing courses across disciplines. While the Board acknowledges that some students may use this flexibility to avoid seriously engaging with disciplines that do not interest them, we believe that most students engage seriously with a diverse array of fields. Splitting the LA requirement will not completely deter students who wish to avoid serious engagement with literature and art, but it will help encourage a broader exploration of the humanities for most students. This is a small change that will make a positive difference without placing a burden on students. Literature and the arts are important disciplines that offer valuable skills, and all Princeton students should have experience in both areas.\nPrinceton\u2019s distribution requirement system attempts to preserve what it fundamentally undermines. Distribution requirements were meant to expose students to a complete set of important disciplines. However, by granting students the license to choose from a whole host of courses \u2014 many only nominally connected to the discipline category \u2014 students can easily avoid getting the well-rounded education that the system was intended to provide. The Board rightly seeks to remedy the problem for the LA requirement, but, in reality,"}

The magic is underground. After descending broad stone stairs, my family passed through the archway and entered what felt like another world.\nIn 1905, Sicilian immigrant Baldassare Forestiere sank his life savings into what he hoped to turn into a fruit orchard, but the trees wouldn\u2019t take root in the hardpan. Devastated, he began working as a laborer in the searing heat of the Central Valley. Then, inspiration struck \u2014 he\u2019d go underground to find relief.

(The forward pass became a legal play in 1906.) Though 7, he\u2019s seemingly become as well-versed in football statistics and facts as a professional sportscaster.\nThe hour-long walking tour continued and we learned how Forestiere \u2014 using only a shovel, pickax and other hand tools \u2014 began to excavate, going as deep as 25 feet underground in a warren of rooms, tunnels and courtyards. In the courtyards, bountiful fruit trees \u2014 grapefruits, Valencia oranges, sour oranges and more \u2014 and grapevines reached toward the sunshine above.\nAs the boys scampered about, their footsteps echoed in the shadowy tunnels, and my husband and I reminded them to stay close and not scramble onto the fragile walls.\nWe peeked into Forestiere\u2019s writing nook, peered through his spy-holes that helped him see approaching visitors, toured his bedroom, kitchen and dining areas, cozy as a hobbit hole and as fantastical, too. A singular vision, no model home or off-the-shelf decor for him.\nThe site boggled my mind, trying to take in the immensity of his effort, the slow, backbreaking toil that went into this project, which he worked on for four decades.\nIt reminded me of a Chinese fable about the old man who lived by a pair of mountains that blocked his view and his path to a river. He began to chip away at the mountain and carried off the dirt in baskets. If he didn\u2019t finish the work, he announced, then his children and grandchildren and generations of descendants would continue the project. For his perseverance, the gods rewarded him by moving the mountains.\nForestiere\u2019s underground gardens made me think about the passion projects that many of us harbor, secretly or not so secretly \u2014 be it a novel, a musical album, woodworking or more. At the beginning, despite our best laid plans, we can\u2019t foresee the twists and turns we may take in the process of creation, and what others might think of our work long after we\u2019re gone.\nForestiere dreamed of creating a resort and ballroom, but passed away in 1946 \u2014 felled by a hernia and then pneumonia \u2014 before his plan reached its fruition.

{"idx": "19540", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Used in addition to video conferences, text chatting lets everyone have their say and pose questions.\n2 What Are the Advantages & Disadvantages of Video Chat in Group Communications?\nFor many small business owners, group chatting is becoming an increasingly popular way to communicate with clients, partners and suppliers. This technology essentially takes the immediacy of instant messaging and allows you to expand on it with dozens of people simultaneously, rather than just one-on-one. Chatting can be used on its own or in addition to conference calls and video presentations. If you have partners or employees spread out across the country, it can also foster a sense of immediacy and collaboration that at one time could only be achieved in a large corporate boardroom.\nWith group chatting, it is possible to conduct multiple conversations with different groups of people simultaneously. For example, an investment broker is able to have a separate group chat session open for different people based on different types of investments. It would be impossible to talk to several people about several different topics all at the same time on a telephone or video conference call. In fact, many businesses use chatting to supplement conference calls or Web-based based presentations because it allows the presenters to speak, while questions and audience discussions can be done in a chat window.\nIf group chatting is used regularly by your business, it can eliminate the need for extra telephone lines, reduce long distance calls and improve productivity. Call centers, for example, are able to work with several clients at the same time, reducing the need for additional staff as well as the frustration of clients who might otherwise be on hold waiting for a live agent. Reducing email in the office by using a combination of instant messaging and group chat can also improve productivity. In 2011, Atos CEO Thierry Breton made international news when he announced plans to ban internal email for 80,000 employees in favor of internal instant messaging. He estimated this would help the company recover between 15 to 20 hours of lost productivity per employee each week.\nSkype, Google and Facebook are three popular platforms used for group chat. Not only are these services free, most of the people you are interacting with for business are probably using at least one of them already. They can be used on any computer without the need to install expensive software. In fact, both Google and Facebook are completely browser-based, requiring no software installation. For small business owners, this translates into virtually no need for tech support.\nLastly, one advantage of group chatting that is often overshadowed by the needs of clients and the demands for increased productivity is the opportunity for learning and collaboration that comes with group chatting. For example, allowing multiple clients to engage with each other in a group chat environment gives you as a business owner the opportunity to learn from from them, in terms of their mutual interests and problems. On the other side of this, being able to chat in a group environment with your suppliers, partners, employees and peers gives you the opportunity to share your experiences as you learn from others.\nA published author and professional speaker, David Weedmark has advised businesses and governments on technology, media and marketing for more than 20 years.

It\u2019s a large device made slim and comfortable by clever design, and is distinguished by a mind-boggling screen, and a superb camera. It\u2019s let down only by hardware buttons, which can be a challenge to locate with accuracy, and the software execution, which hasn\u2019t really tamed Android or added much to it.\nThis year\u2019s flagship from LG has been designed to put a large, stunning display in your hands. At 1440x2560-pixels, the G3 offers more detail than anything else on the market, and actually much more than the naked eye can see. The 5.5 inch display also affords plenty of room to view your games or images.\nHowever, specs don\u2019t quite convey the excellence of LG\u2019s design. After all, the G3 should feel like an enormo-phablet \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t at all. That\u2019s because, as with last year\u2019s G2, LG has removed the side and top buttons found on most modern portaphones and moved the volume and power round to the back to make a slim, smooth, tapered design with very thin (but still comfortable and curved) edges.\nThe bezels are very thin and even the phone\u2019s chin \u2013 sans dedicated Android buttons, as is the norm these days \u2013 is quite narrow. It\u2019s the hardware designer's equivalent to a trompe l\u2019oeil something that is actually big doesn\u2019t feel so big.\nNow consider that the LG G3 has a removable 3000mAh battery, and also supports Qi wireless charging \u2013 a huge convenience most people haven\u2019t tried. And it weighs just 149g, about the same as the Galaxy S5\u2019s 145g and a shade less than the HTC One M8. For a display that trumps 6-inch tablets, this is a marvel of thoughtful miniaturisation and clever design choices.\nIt\u2019s achieved by eschewing metal and glass where it isn\u2019t needed \u2013 the the removable back cover has a faux metal effect \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t feel cheap and the trade-off is a significant one.\nThe good design extends to some of the complementary accessories LG has produced to work with the G3. Three of these merit particular attention. There\u2019s a very nice windowing \u201cQuickCircle\u201d flip cover \u2013 which is not a new idea, but LG\u2019s is the best implementation I\u2019ve seen by miles; the LG Tone Infinim (HBS-900) headset with Harmon-Kardon buds, and an unusual Qi charger that folds away.\nThe potential showstopper with the G3 is you\u2019ll have to get accustomed to groping around the back of the phone to activate the power and volume keys. The buttons are distinguished enough, but really they and need to be a millimetre or two bigger.\nSo after several days of using the LG G3, around one in seven attempts to hit the power button actually succeeds. Most of the time I hit a combination of power and one of the volume keys.\nIf this was my long-term device I\u2019d superglue a button from a kid\u2019s craft kit, or a felt washer onto the power button.

Interestingly, this means it also will allow you to cast, play, and project over your library of PC or Steam games to an Xbox console. That is thanks to an ability to share an Xbox One controller as an input for a connected PC.\nUnfortunately, keyboard and mouse support are not supported, so you can\u2019t connect a physical keyboard or mouse to your Xbox to control your PC or games. Streaming protected content from Netflix and Hulu also won\u2019t work for copyright reasons. You can, however, leverage the app to mirror your Android phone over to the Xbox One.\nSetting up the experience with Windows 10 is fairly easy. Once the app is installed and running on Xbox, all it takes to get started is to head onto your PC and visit the Project settings page by holding down the Windows and P keys on your keyboard. You can then select Connect to a Wireless Display and choose your Xbox console from the list. For the ability to control the PC or play games with the Xbox Controller, you must choose the option to Allow mouse, keyboard, touch, and pen input from this device.\nAs OnMSFT points out, the Xbox One app features an ability to switch between latency modes such as gaming, working, and watching videos.

Going all-out and casting internet-connection-dependent Steam games might be too much for the Xbox One to handle if you\u2019re on a Wi-Fi connection with slower speeds.\nMicrosoft\u2019s free app launched on Tuesday, March 12. The app joins other applications that already allow gamers to mirror their PC or smartphone screens over to the Xbox One.

It is important that both sides immediately cease military activities so that the inspection team will safely conduct this investigation. Whatever differences there may be, it is important that all the differences of opinions should be resolved peacefully through dialogue. That is our firm position since the beginning of the crisis.

Indeed, not since Killmonger in \"Black Panther\" has a supervillain been as sympathetic as Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong), who endured horrific psychological abuse at the hands of his father and older brother in 1974 as a child in upstate New York. When he is transported to the Rock of Eternity and is deemed unworthy of Shazam's powers, he vows to prove that he is good enough to both the strange wizard and his heinous immediate family. Because the writing and acting are so strong, the audience is able to understand Sivana's pain even as he acts like the monster that circumstances practically foreordained he'd become.\nFocusing on Sivana's story risks making this movie seem grim, though, when in fact its lighthearted humor is its main strength. Nothing in the DC Extended Universe films \u2014 which have so far included \"Man of Steel,\" \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Suicide Squad,\" \"Wonder Woman,\" \"Justice League\" and \"Aquaman\" \u2014 can properly be described as a comedy. The best movies of that bunch, \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Aquaman,\" have their funny moments, but all still firmly feel like traditional superhero epics, in addition to connecting themselves to a grander universe of superhero movies.\n\"Shazam!\", on the other hand, seems content to be a happy movie about why kids love superheroes and wish they could become heroes themselves. The best scenes in the film involve Batson in adult form as the superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi), learning how to use his powers and exulting in the coolness of it all with his foster brother and best friend Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). The performances by Levi, Grazer and (in non-superhero form) Angel are all buoyed by a fantastic script by Henry Gayden and the skillful direction of David F. Sandberg. While superhero origin stories and learning-how-to-use-their-power story arcs are usually obligatory affairs that feel dreary and recycled, those moments are the primary appeal of \"Shazam!\" We laugh at the banter of these characters \u2014 who know they live in the DC superhero universe and play off of that fact \u2014 and care enough about them to enjoy seeing them revel in being part of their own superhero story.\nSpecial attention should also be paid to the other child actors as well.

The commodity and its derivatives such as mint oil, pepper mint oil are widely used in industries such as food, pharmaceuticals and perfumes. Data from the Ministry of Commerce show that the export of mentha oil and its derivative products are on the rise since financial year 2011-12. Exports increased 21.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively.\nThe volume of exports in 2012-13 was 15,891 tonnes. And exports in the first half of the current fiscal were 9,963 tonnes.\nBeing an export-oriented commodity, a pick up in global demand and weak rupee can limit the downside pressure on mentha oil and chances are good for prices to rebound.\nLong-term view The MCX menthe oil futures contract has been declining since 2012.\nThe trend is likely to continue in the coming months. However, the contract has a strong long-term support at Rs 600, which can halt the current downtrend. A reversal from this support will have the potential to take the contract higher to Rs 1,300 in the long-term.\nMedium-term view: The medium-term trend is down. Key resistance is at Rs 1,100 and the trend will remain bearish as long as the contract trades below this resistance level.\nImmediate support is at Rs 800. A break below this support can take the contract lower to Rs 600 in the medium-term. However, if the contract fails to break below Rs 800, an intermediate rally to Rs 1,100 is possible before a fall.\nShort-term view: The downtrend since March 2013 is getting support near Rs 800 over the past few months. The contract can trade sideways between Rs 800 and Rs 900 for a while. A break above Rs 900 can take the contract higher to Rs 1,050 in the short term.\nOn the other hand, a fall to Rs 700 is possible in the short term if the contract declines below Rs 800."}

He\u2019d play it like he did his first 1,912. In Citizens Bank Park, he knew, that would be plenty.\nHe would play hard and he would run hard. He would take a fastball to the ribs if it meant reaching base. If necessary, he would create a collision at second base. If necessary, he would avoid one, spin, fake a throw one way and toss one another.\nHe would do all of that, Chase Utley would. He would do that, because that\u2019s how he became so firmly popular in a city that doesn\u2019t embrace many.\nHe would do that for the Dodgers, and he would be cheered, all night, from the lineup introductions to the final innings. And this time, unlike the other times he\u2019d been back in the past three seasons, those innings would be oh so few.\nUtley will retire at the end of the season. He\u2019s 39 and wants to spend more time with his kids. But he also had one home run in the first 62 games of his 16th major-league season. So it was time. Yet as he would, as he always had, he first would think through every possible ramification of the play. One he knew would matter: Announcing his retirement before the Dodgers would make their only appearance of the season in a park that someday will include a tribute to him in some form of bronze or another.\nHe didn\u2019t have the power of Jim Thome, the accomplishments of Richie Ashburn, the arm of Manny Trillo or even as many hits as Larry Bowa, who was never considered a hitter. But unlikely as it would have seemed that a private, Los Angeles-raised, UCLA product who never had any connection to the city could have done it, Utley drove himself into that company of eternal fan favorites.\nThe 2008 World Series championship helped. Had the Phillies\u2019 division champions of 2007 through 2011 only failed in the playoffs, Utley would have been closer to Scott Rolen on the popularity scale than to Tug McGraw. But the parade, and his behavior at the after-party, solidified his status as a legend.\nHe wasn\u2019t just a world champion. He was a world champion with an expletive-adjective. And that made 2.6 million at the party feel that way, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what was on my mind at the time,\u201d Utley recalled. \u201cIt was a pretty exciting moment, not only for myself but for my teammates and the coaching staff and the whole city of Philadelphia.\nSome didn\u2019t. Most did. And that\u2019s why he always receives standing ovations when he returns, as he did Monday, when Dan Baker\u2019s pregame mention of his name resulted in such applause that Utley needed to pounce from the dugout for a two-handed thank-you wave.\nThe fans supported most of the players from that era, reserving some bitterness for Jayson Werth, who signed with Washington for more money than the Phillies were willing to pay. They can be that way. But they can be the way they are to Utley, too. He didn\u2019t field like Jimmy Rollins or hit with Ryan Howard"}

Less than a year after the announcement, the streaming network has released the first teaser for the movie, which appears to be set in an American high school (though it was shot in Canada and U.S.).\nBased on the acclaimed Japanese manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the story follows Light Turner (Nat Wolff), a smart, broody teenager who finds a supernatural notebook \u201clost\u201d by a Shinigami (grim reaper) called Ryuk (voice of Willem Dafoe). When Light discovers it holds the power to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages while imagining the victim\u2019s face, he becomes intoxicated with this new godlike ability and begins to eliminate everyone he deems unworthy of living in his imagined utopia.\nThe manga was first adapted into a popular 37-episode anime series in 2006.

The fall in crude oil prices from a high of $85 per barrel to $53 per barrel is a big positive for the Indian economy. That keeps inflation in check as India imports most of its fuel. If, as a result, interest rates remain low, stock markets are expected to do well.\nThe risks are general election scheduled in mid-2019, currency wars seen globally and a resulting global slowdown. \u201cTrade wars will continue but its impact on the market will recede over a period of time,\u201d says Arun Gopalan, senior vice president, investment advisory and research, Systematix Shares and Stocks.\nIf, as a result, foreigners withdraw money from emerging markets, such as India, which are typically referred to as developing and high-risk markets, the Indian rupee and equity markets would be impacted, adds Gopalan.\nWhat about interest rates? Are they expected to go down in 2019? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised interest rates in early 2018 by 50 basis points, but in the last monetary policy opted to change its expectation of inflation.\nThe monetary policy committee of RBI cut its inflation forecast for September 2018 to April 2019 period to 2.7-3.2 percent from 3.9-4.5 percent earlier.

A new study published in June 2015 in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u00ae (ASA), found resuming angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), common medications used to treat high blood pressure, within two days after surgery decreased death rates in the first month following surgery.\nThe release explains that in the study, researchers examined more than 30,000 patients who were regularly taking ARB medication prior to surgery and were admitted to the Veterans Affairs Healthcare system for non-cardiac surgery between 1999 and 2011.\nNearly one third (10,205) of the patients studied did not have their usual ARB medication resumed within two days of their operation. The delay in restarting ARBs was associated with an increase in death rate within 30-days of surgery, when compared to those whose medication had been promptly resumed. The effect was greater in patients under 60 years old. Researchers also found reduced rates of infection, pneumonia, heart failure and kidney failure in patients whose ARB medications were resumed soon after surgery, suggesting that early resumption may also reduce complications after surgery.\nUntil now and despite their widespread use, there has been little information to guide physicians in the optimal timing for restarting ARBs after surgery. Doctors may continue to withhold ARB medication after surgery because they are concerned the medication may cause dangerously low blood pressure or disrupt kidney function. However, even after accounting for these complications in the first two days after surgery, resuming ARB medication was associated with a 50 percent lower mortality rate in the first month after surgery.\nImmediately following surgery, patients are often transferred to different units within the hospital. Previous research has found that some regularly prescribed medications may not get resumed during these \u201ctransitions of care.\u201d Last year, the ASA introduced the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH), a physician-led, patient-centered, multidisciplinary team-based model of coordinated care. With physician anesthesiologists at the helm of the PSH model helping to ensure patient safety and quality of care throughout the entire surgical process \u2013 from admission to recovery and post-discharge \u2013 the PSH model stands to improve and standardize patient processes like \u201cmedication reconciliation,\u201d ensuring a patient\u2019s medications are resumed appropriately during the surgical process."}

Our research focuses on elucidating the genetic, demographic, and evolutionary processes underlying the introduction, establishment, and spread of weeds and invasive plants, and their adaptation to changing environments, including management practices. To date, we have focused on two systems for our studies: cropland weeds evolving resistance to herbicides and invasive plants with horticultural origins. The two systems are not only ideal for basic research on processes underlying weed evolution and spread, but also include some of the worst weed problems in California.

{"idx": "19598", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Every argument for and against the Affordable Care Act came to a head this summer as opponents tried to repeal the 7-year-old law that is both loathed and lauded as Obamacare. And despite their failure during the summer, the political debate continues.\nSupporters of the ACA come with their most compelling figures: The number of Americans without health insurance fell from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2016 (HHS, 2017). The growth rate of health care spending slowed significantly after ACA passage. As shown in Figure 1, after rising from 13.3 percent to 17.4 percent during the 2000 to 2010 period, health care spending as a share of GDP rose to just 17.8 percent by 2015.\nThe law\u2019s detractors are armed with their strongest data, as well. They focused on rising prices in many of the state-based health insurance exchanges and a decline in the number of private insurers participating in the exchanges. The median premium increase from 2016 to 2017 was 19 percent. Additionally, 21 percent of exchange enrollees had just one insurer from which to choose in 2017. Just one year earlier, only 2 percent of enrollees faced such a lack of competition (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2017). These changes are consistent with earlier research that less competition in private health insurance markets leads to higher premiums (Dafny, Duggan, and Ramanarayanan, 2012).\nAt least one loud criticism of the law \u2014 that it was killing jobs \u2014 was discredited by research that I recently conducted with colleagues at Stanford (Duggan, Goda, and Jackson, 2017).\nThe ACA is far from a perfect piece of legislation. But it\u2019s now time for policymakers to dig into the law and find ways to make improvements \u2014 even as some critics are still looking for ways to scrap it.\nIn this policy brief, I describe in greater detail the impact of the ACA \u2014 focusing especially on provisions that were designed to expand health insurance coverage. I also discuss some potential reforms that could address some of the key shortcomings of the legislation \u2014 focusing mainly on stimulating competition and expanding choice in the health insurance exchanges.\nThe effect of the Affordable Care Act has varied substantially across the country. That\u2019s largely because of states\u2019 decisions about whether or not to expand Medicaid to residents with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL) \u2014 or about $34,000 for a family of four.\nAs of this month, only 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded their programs. Largely because of these changes, the number of Medicaid recipients in the U.S. increased from 58 million in late 2013 to 75 million this year.\nThe Medicaid expansions were fully funded by the U.S. government between 2014 and 2016, with the federal share of spending slowly declining to 90 percent by 2020. In expanding states, the fraction of residents enrolled in Medicaid increased from 19.2 percent in late 2013 to 26.6 percent by May 2017. The corresponding increase was much smaller in states that did not expand, with enrollment increasing from 16.3 percent to 18.3 percent during the same period.\n"}

But the technology now looks embarrassingly primitive in the age of the multimedia smartphone.\nSo some healthcare start-ups are looking at ways to improve how doctors and nurses communicate, care for patients and manage treatments.\nNiall Rafferty, a radiographer and boss of a tech firm, Medxnote, says anecdotal evidence from doctors suggests that \"we're wasting about 45 minutes to an hour each per day by using pagers\".\nThe Irish start-up has developed a secure messaging app for hospital staff - like a version of group messaging platform WhatsApp, but one that's wearing a white coat and stethoscope.\nDublin's Blackrock Clinic piloted the app in one of its wards and is now interested in extending its use across the entire hospital, says the hospital's head of IT, John Hayes.\nBlackrock's previous communications system wasn't secure and offered no way of acknowledging that people had received the message, he explains.\n\"We would like to roll it out to the rest of the hospital and make it the mandatory way of sending patient information,\" he says.\nBut it's the multimedia potential of smartphone apps that is interesting hospitals, not just their more responsive text communications features.\nMany health professionals have already been using publicly available apps, like WhatsApp and Viber, to share photos of patient conditions and carry out online consultations, says Mr Rafferty.\n\"Unofficially people are taking photos of a wound or something and they might text it to a doctor to see what kind of antibiotic they want,\" he says. \"It's widespread in hospitals.\"\nThe big problem is that this way of doing things doesn't comply with strict privacy and security rules governing patient data. So Medxnote is planning to add a secure photo-sharing feature to its app soon.\n\"We have all the functionality of a WhatsApp but all the images stay within Medxnote - they don't go up to the cloud or to your photo gallery. It's all encrypted; it's safe and secure,\" he says.\nBlackrock Clinic is waiting until this important feature is added before rolling out the Medxnote app in its hospital. It also wants the firm to add support for Android phones - something that is in the pipeline, Mr Rafferty says.\nSecure connectivity means clinicians can also get access to patient records and health data much more quickly.\n\"I think the reason that people are moving to applications like this is because there are other features available besides just reaching you with a text,\" says Ed Ricks, chief information officer at Beaufort Memorial Hospital in Beaufort, South Carolina.\nHis hospital has been using Imprivata's secure communications platform and trialling automatically sending electronic medical records to health professionals in real time.\nUK-based Sensium Healthcare specialises in wearable health monitoring sensors that transmit data wirelessly.\nIt has teamed up with Medxnote to bid for a National Health Service pilot scheme testing how this real-time patient data can be sent to the relevant clinicians via the messaging app.\nThis way, doctors and nurses can respond more quickly to health alerts, the companies hope.\nHospitals are also catching up with the latest app technology in the operating room.\nSurgeons are still using a lot of guesswork when trying to keep track of blood soaked up by sponges and swabs during operations.\nGauss Surgical in California decided there must be an app for that, too.\nIts iPad app, Triton, which"}

Executive Editor Mike O'Malley, then working for the Miami Herald, remembers reading those words and marveling at how cool it would be to hang out on the veranda at Augusta with Jenkins and Company. \"I remember closing my eyes and thinking, If I could get there just once, it would be so great,\" recalls O'Malley, who has overseen our Masters coverage since 1997.\nSuch musings began a tradition of inviting famous writers and artists to join us in our Masters house and contribute pieces that we've come to call \"First Impressions.\" Peter Andrews, George Plimpton, Holly Brubach, Joe Queenan, Bruce McCall, Joe McNally, Bernie Fuchs, Rowland B.

Mark's work decorates the back cover, and his portfolio inside includes a self-portrait (on Arnold Palmer's right).\nThe thought of renewing an old friendship with Jenkins was part of the hook for Brokaw. \"I remember years ago,\" says Dan, \"when he had me on 'Today' to plug one of my novels. We chatted for a moment on the air. Stopped for a commercial. Tom took a phone call from the producer, turned to me in shock and said, 'Sadat's been killed.' I said, 'Does that mean we can't talk about something important?' He was off to Egypt before the end of the day.\"\nOur week at Augusta wasn't so momentous -- Immelman won -- but Tom's passion for golf and intelligent conversation provided a lively mix. (Jenkins to Brokaw over breakfast: \"Tom, tell us the truth: Isn't Katie Couric the devil?\") Brokaw's ability to casually name-drop without the slightest pretense is unmatched (\"And then I said to Cheney ... \"), as the man has known literally every important world figure of the last 40 years (about Obama, last April: \"He just needs a little roughing up\").\nThe golf brought us back to reality. \"I belong to Deepdale,\" he said, \"and I love to visit the Floridian, Wayne Huizenga's course.

{"idx": "19612", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Carpets that get a lot of use should have the best quality pad.\nWhile choosing a carpet in your desired color, texture and thickness is certainly important, it is even more important to choose the correct underpad. Carpet padding does much more than make your carpet more comfortable to walk on: It keeps your carpet from wearing out faster, and some types even resist mold and insect damage.\nCarpet gets a lot of abuse. People walk on it constantly, compressing the fibers and the pad and sometimes tracking dirt and debris into the pile. It is often exposed to too much light or moisture. The most important job of a good pad is to absorb the impact of high traffic.\nThe density of carpet padding is usually expressed as pounds per cubic foot. Many padding manufacturers recommend a density of 8 pounds per cubic foot, but a pad of at least 5 pounds that is 3/8 inch thick is the standard for most padding for light-traffic areas, as set by the Carpet Cushion Council. The council suggests 6.5 pounds and the same thickness -- 3/8 inch -- for heavy-traffic areas. Consumers are advised to purchase the densest pad that they can afford for longest wear and most comfort. Density and thickness suggestions apply to all types of padding.\nWaffle or sponge rubber is a common pad type made from a combination of natural and synthetic rubber. It is mold-, mildew- and insect-proof and is nonallergenic. On the downside, it loses resilience with age. Foam rubber is not actually rubber but a form of latex. This type of pad is a thin layer often applied to the back of kitchen carpets. It is a good choice for kitchens because it resists damage from insects and mildew. Flat rubber padding is the most expensive type of pad and the longest lasting, according to the Carpet Buyer's Handbook. While most pads are replaced when the carpet is replaced, flat rubber pads, at densities of 19 to 22 pounds, will typically outlast their initial carpet installation. The cost makes them prohibitive for most consumers, however.\nFelt pads are made from 100 percent hair or a combination of hair and other fibers such as jute pressed together. The advantage of this type of pad is that it wears well; disadvantages are that it sheds, collects dust and easily stretches out of shape. This last quality can be prevented by purchasing a felt pad with an applied layer of latex or rubber.\nAccording to the Carpet Buyer's Handbook, the most popular type of carpet padding sold today is bonded urethane. Made from scraps of dense urethane foam pressed into padding, it is available in a variety of densities and thicknesses. A disadvantage to this material is that it may contain the chemical butylated hydroxy toluene, which is not harmful to human health but can cause yellowing of the pad.\nMany consumers make the mistake of choosing pads that are too soft or too thick. Pads under carpets in high-traffic areas should not be so soft that they flatten out when stepped on, thereby speeding up wear on the carpet. For wall-to-wall carpeting, the pad should not be so thick that it raises the carpet above the level of the tack strips \u2013 usually \u00bd inch high -- which will also stress the carpet fibers. An ideal pad first and foremost provides support for the carpet and secondarily some additional comfort when walked on.\nRockwood, Patricia. \"How to Choose a Carpet Underpad.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homegu"}

This season, in its subscription series for Performing Arts Chicago, however, the estimable foursome has become even more adventurous: it's presenting two local premieres of works by living composers. Part of the credit probably goes to violinist Mathias Tacke, who was a member of an avant-garde collective in Germany before joining the quartet last season, Tacke can produce a more somber tone than his predecessor and has a better grasp of contemporary string literature, and his zeal seems to have rubbed off on his colleagues; last season, for the first time in a long while, they shook off the tasteful reticence that marked many of their past performances of modern pieces. All of this bodes well for Lowell Liebermann's brand-new work for quartet and mezzo-soprano (to be premiered early next year) and for Twelve Microludes by Gyorgy Kurtag, which tops the bill at this week's concert. Kurtag, who was born in Romania but emigrated to Budapest early in his career, was influenced first by Bartok and Kodaly, later by Webern and Berg. Twelve Microludes, written in 1977 and only ten minutes long, is wickedly Webernian, consisting of a dozen miniatures that are as fleeting and enigmatic as haiku.

At one time, an individual could meet criteria for one or the other (not both) for a given substance. Substance dependence was considered the more severe use disorder; its criteria included physiological, tolerance, and withdrawal, as well as continued use despite incurring health consequences. Now, in the updated (2013) DSM-5, SUDs are not characterized by the abuse vs. dependence distinction. See updated symptom criteria for substance use disorders.\nMost professionals recognize a dynamic interplay of factors as contributing to addictive tendencies involving alcohol and other substances. This is why, in addition to detoxification and inpatient rehab, psychosocial treatments are critical for recovery from an alcohol use disorder.\nPsychosocial treatments are programs that can target components of the social and cultural structures surrounding an individual and the problematic psychological and behavioral patterns of that individual.\nSeveral psychological and behavioral therapies have received support from scientific studies and have been deemed appropriate by the American Psychological Association (Division 12) for treating alcohol use disorders. These generally take a patient-focused or a systems-focused format. Systems-focused refers to a treatment that mainly targets the surrounding social and structural sphere of the individual, rather than their mental health status.\nPsychosocial treatments that are backed by clinical research evidence include: moderate drinking, behavioral couples therapy for alcohol use disorders, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and prize-based contingency management.\nAlcoholics Anonymous (A.A.), though not developed as a clinical treatment, is the most widely-used method for remaining abstinent from alcohol. A.A. has been a great resource for many and can be used alone or in combination with therapy in promotion of abstinence.\nWhen starting treatment, you and your therapist will collaborate on a treatment plan. In addition to incorporating your feedback, they might add feedback from individuals closest to you (if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like).\nOverall, appropriate choice and context of therapy will depend on various factors, including the severity of the alcohol use problem; your motivation to stop drinking; level of dysfunction in your environment; your cognitive functioning; level of impulse control; and the presence of co-occurring mental illness.\nSome of these factors also can make abstinence and recovery more difficult\u2014namely low impulse control, a severe mood disorder, and lack of support at home. This is when it can help to remain in a controlled or semi-controlled setting until you\u2019ve gained a foundational skill set for remaining abstinent or reducing harm.\nDuring the early recovery or \u201cremission phase\u201d from an alcohol use disorder (within the first 12-months post-cessation of alcohol), you have a higher chance of abstaining from alcohol if you reside temporarily in a place that isn\u2019t conducive to drinking. This is especially the case if you\u2019re aiming for complete abstinence (as opposed to reducing your drinking).\nThus, a residential center or halfway house can be an important treatment resource when you\u2019re newly discharged from inpatient care. The halfway house provides emotional support, counseling, and progressive entry into society.\nSober living community homes are similar in that they are semi-controlled residences where you can live among other people who are in recovery. This can be a positive step for several reasons. You have a chance to build a support network"}

This is not a decision I make lightly, for I am a lifelong Republican. But Donald Trump does not reflect historical Republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country.\nWhen the primary season started, it soon became apparent that, much like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mr. Trump was connecting with many Americans who felt that their voices were not being heard in Washington and who were tired of political correctness. But rejecting the conventions of political correctness is different from showing complete disregard for common decency. Mr. Trump did not stop with shedding the stilted campaign dialogue that often frustrates voters. Instead, he opted for a constant stream of denigrating comments, including demeaning Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) heroic military service and repeatedly insulting Fox News host Megyn Kelly.\nWith the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing \u2014 either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level \u2014 that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.\nMy conclusion about Mr. Trump\u2019s unsuitability for office is based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics. Instead, he opts to mock the vulnerable and inflame prejudices by attacking ethnic and religious minorities. Three incidents in particular have led me to the inescapable conclusion that Mr. Trump lacks the temperament, self-discipline and judgment required to be president.\nThe first was his mocking of a reporter with disabilities, a shocking display that did not receive the scrutiny it deserved. I kept expecting Mr. Trump to apologize, at least privately, but he did not, instead denying that he had done what seemed undeniable to anyone who watched the video. At the time, I hoped that this was a terrible lapse, not a pattern of abuse.\nThe second was Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge born and raised in Indiana, could not rule fairly in a case involving Trump University because of his Mexican heritage. For Mr. Trump to insist that Judge Curiel would be biased because of his ethnicity demonstrated a profound lack of respect not only for the judge but also for our constitutional separation of powers, the very foundation of our form of government. Again, I waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words.\nThird was Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the grieving parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq. It is inconceivable that anyone, much less a presidential candidate, would attack two Gold Star parents. Rather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr. Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero. And once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong.\nI am also deeply concerned that Mr.\u2009Trump\u2019s lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control.\nI had hoped that we would see a \u201cnew\u201d"}

In fact, China\u2019s religious upheaval around 1911 is central to its last hundred years of tumult, helping to explain the fanatical totalitarianism that gripped the country and now its bare-knuckled capitalism.\nChinese are often described as pragmatic people with little interest in faith. The prominent Chinese intellectual Hu Shih (1891\u20131962) declared that \u201cChina is a country without religion.\u201d In fact, this was how early-twentieth-century Chinese intellectuals wished to see their nation\u2014as free from what they presumed to be the backward and superstitious beliefs of their ancestors.\nYet for millennia, China was held together by its spiritual life, a shared system of ritual and belief that helped unite a country divided by harsh geography and mutually incomprehensible dialects. Every Chinese village had shrines to local deities and every home had altars to the ancestors, a pattern repeated across the vast land, whose rivers and mountains were also deified. Time was ordered by the unity of the sacred and the temporal: the calendar started when winter was on the wane with rituals and festivals meant to mirror the slowly awakening earth. Belief was based on moral equilibrium (you reap what you sow), as well as a world of spirits mirroring and interacting with the world of humans.\nOverlaying this ancient system of belief were the formal religions of Daoism and Buddhism, which both took hold in China roughly two thousand years ago. These faiths were presided over by tens of thousands of religious specialists who carried out rites to purge evil and restore harmony. By the end of the nineteenth century, it was estimated that China had a million temples, or one for roughly every four hundred people. It was a country centered on a religious-political order held together by the emperor, who spent much of his time carrying out rituals at imperial temples to make sure that his empire was at one with the heavens."}

In calling for more investment in science and technology, President Obama has said the \"Sputnik moment is back\" for the United States, according to Network World. He was referring to the 1957 orbiting Soviet satellite now synonymous with any foreign challenge to America's technical dominance.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu also recently referred to the Soviet satellite and it was mentioned Tuesday in a New York Times story on U.S. students' mediocre performance on an international test. The Program for International Student Assessment, known as PISA, is given to 15-year-old students by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nThis year, students from Shanghai, China, took the test for the first time and basically cleaned up, placing first in reading, math and science. Of the 56 countries represented, U.S. students placed 23rd in science, 17th in reading and 31st in math, in line with where they usually place on this test. Those kinds of results barely make news anymore.\nWow, I'm kind of stunned, I'm thinking Sputnik. I've seen how relentless the Chinese are at accomplishing goals, and if they can do this in Shanghai in 2009, they can do it in 10 cities in 2019, and in 50 cities by 2029.\nWe have to see this as a wake-up call. I know skeptics will want to argue with the results, but we consider them to be accurate and reliable, and we have to see them as a challenge to get better.... We can quibble, or we can face the brutal truth that we're being out-educated.\nMuch of the reporting on the scores notes that the Chinese students from the modern city of Shanghai are not representative of the country as a whole, which does not try to educate all children equally. It's easy to find articles on why comparisons on these international tests are not valid, including one in The Washington Post, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and one at The Atlantic.\nIt is a warning to advanced economies that they cannot take for granted that they will forever have \"human capital\" superior to that in other parts of the world. At a time of intensified global competition, they will need to work hard to maintain a knowledge and skill base that keeps up with changing demands.\nWe've been trying to \"reform\" education in this country for at least 30 years, and my colleague Ann All has written repeatedly about the continuing calls for improvement in science and technology education.\n... our high-stakes standardized test obsession, the ones mandated by No Child Left Behind, have, apparently, done nothing to improve the reading, science and math literacy of American 15-year-olds if, that is, you put a lot of stock in the results of one international testing system. And even if you don't.\nFor nearly a decade, public schools have been test-obsessed, and charter schools have abounded. Those who hold test scores as important measures of progress should face the obvious: NCLB didn't work.\nAnd that is something Congress should seriously consider when it decides whether, and how, to change No Child Left Behind.\nI would add that if it takes a little hysteria and a few references to Sputnik to finally see better results, so be it."}

It\u2019s definitely going to increase costs. And of course that ultimately leads to increased costs for the taxpayer,\u201d he said.\nThe tariffs are also likely to make ally countries less inclined to buy U.S.-made defense systems, should they have to absorb added costs associated with the trade rules, Hunter added.\nPresident Trump first announced the tariffs in March, citing national security concerns. He imposed them under Section 232, a law that allows tariffs to be imposed for national security reasons.\nThe defense industry lobbied against the tariffs and quickly spoke out against them, warning they would lead to retaliation by trading partners. The European Union and Mexico are already poised to hit back with tariffs on U.S. exports.\n\u201cWe have concerns about tariffs for a number of reasons: the impact on the global supply chain; what that could mean to our companies; certainly, what escalation might mean in terms of retaliation,\u201d said Eric Fanning, CEO of the defense industry lobbying giant Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).\nFanning said AIA has communicated its concerns to the White House, while one defense industry consultant told The Hill that other defense contractor giants, including General Electric (GE), have begun to reach out to Congress in hopes of swaying the administration.\nGOP lawmakers have been among those criticizing Trump\u2019s trade policies, though the consultant said there is support for what Trump is doing in some parts of the country.\n\u201cGE is asking for pushback, and I think a lot of offices are going to be receptive to that, but some offices are very reluctant to oppose Trump because anti-free trade polls very high in areas where Trump is popular: Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, etc.,\u201d the source said.\nThe consultant said the defense industry should worry about retaliatory moves by ally countries against U.S. products and equipment.\nAnother industry consultant offered the view that the tariffs could be lifted soon, with Trump using them as a bargaining chip.\nBut Hunter was skeptical that the administration was making such a play.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to suppose that this administration may rapidly change course because we\u2019ve seen that, but ... I don\u2019t see what agreement could be reached that would cause these tariffs to go away,\u201d Hunter said.\nThe administration is seeking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, and the tariffs have been seen as part of Trump\u2019s strategy to put pressure on those countries to make concessions.\nAfter Trump\u2019s announcement, however, Canada, Mexico and the European Union appeared more interested in striking back against the U.S.\n\u201cObviously the renegotiating of NAFTA is the big one that I think the president is looking to incentivize with putting these tariffs on, but, what I\u2019ve read, it doesn\u2019t look like we"}

She was a foreign correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor from 1996-2010, where she covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and served as the newspaper\u2019s bureau chief in Jerusalem, Istanbul and Tokyo. Most recently she served as Jerusalem correspondent for TIME Magazine, a columnist for Haaretz, and a program host on TLV1 Radio.\nFor 70 years, Israel has been sitting on a contradiction.\nSeven decades later, it has become harder than ever for Israel to strike a balance between being a Jewish state and promising equal rights to all. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just tipped the scales\u2014or rather, yanked them\u2014in the direction of promoting the state\u2019s Jewish character. It\u2019s not clear that the equality outlined in the founders\u2019 vision statement remains a goal. It\u2019s certainly far from reality.\nEarly Thursday, Israel\u2019s parliament passed what\u2019s known as the Nation-State Law, versions of which had been kicking around the chambers of the Knesset for seven years. To some, the law simply codifies what much of the world already thought was a given: that Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people, though it claims \u201cthe unique right to nation self-determination\u201d that is central to the conflict with the Palestinians.\nThe new law essentially makes discrimination constitutional, according to Mordechai Kremnitzer, professor emeritus of the Faculty of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, writing in the Israeli daily Haaretz. He argues that the new law essentially treats Arabs as if they are trespassers in Israel, and constitutes the start of their \u201cactual transfer\u201d from the land.\nAdalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, agrees that it not only codifies discrimination, but also creates a situation in which Arabs are forced to participate in that discrimination because they bear equal tax burdens as citizens.\nTo look at the Nation-State Law simply as a civil rights issue would be to miss the bigger picture of the stalled peace process that successive governments\u2014and the Trump administration\u2014have promised to rejuvenate. The roots of this new law go to the heart the of Israeli Right\u2019s greatest fears about making peace with the Palestinians. Israeli nationalists theorize that even if Israel would agree in the future to the creation of a Palestinian state, Palestinian citizens of Israel\u2014 also known as Israeli Arabs\u2014will eventually demand autonomy in large swaths of the country, possibly even demanding annexation to the neighboring Palestinian state, leading to the gradual destruction of Israel as we know it.\nThis has been at the heart of arguments by Avigdor Lieberman, now serving as Defense Minister. He has suggested Israel swap land with a future Palestinian state to reduce the number of Arabs in Israel and campaigned on having Israelis of every stripe sign a loyalty pledge or lose their citizenship. Though fears about the chipping away of Israel might seem overblown to some, it\u2019s a scenario Netanyahu\u2019s circles take seriously. Israel constantly watches its demographic balance, fearing the loss of a Jewish majority. In February, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said Israel must maintain its majority even at the expense of human rights.\nAnd so Israel has passed a law that sends a message to the 22% of Israeli citizens who are Arab \u2014 that Israel considers them second-class citizens, and essentially"}

Adler died four weeks later.\nMorris Adler was a big figure, not only in his synagogue of more than 1,000 families, not only in Conservative Judaism, but also in the communal life of Detroit, where he served on a variety of commissions and public bodies.\nHe had been born in Slutsk, Russia (today, Belarus), on March 30, 1906, and was brought to the United States in 1913 by his parents, Rabbi Joseph Adler and the former Jennie Resnick. After graduating in 1928 from the City College of New York, Adler decided he wanted to enter the rabbinate \u2013 like his father, only as a Conservative rabbi.\nAfter ordination from the Jewish Theological Seminary, in 1935, Adler worked briefly at a synagogue in Buffalo, New York, before becoming assistant rabbi at Sha\u2019arey Zedek in 1938. He remained there for the rest of his career \u2013 except for his service as an army chaplain in the Pacific during World War II, and a 1964-65 sabbatical in Israel \u2013 becoming \u201crabbi for life\u201d in 1954.\nAt Sha'arey Zedek, Adler plunged into the field of adult education, was involved in a variety of ecumenical activities, not only with non-Jews in Detroit, but also in an effort to improve communication between different Jewish denominations. His was also an adviser to the United Auto Workers, an important force in Michigan in those days, and a close friend of the union\u2019s president, Walter Reuther.\nBy all accounts, Adler was attentive to his congregants too, and was available to provide religious services and counseling. In fact, in the months preceding his murder, he had met a number of times with Richard Wishnetsky, the 23-year-old congregant who shot him that Shabbat morning.\nWishnetsky was a brilliant young man. A 1964 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Michigan, he had been strongly affected by the November 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The following summer, he went to Israel, and when he returned home, he was a changed man.\nDuring the half-year preceding the killing, Wishnetsky was in and out of psychiatrists\u2019 offices and mental hospitals. He visited with the Lubavitcher Rebbe in Brooklyn, and was accepted for graduate study by the University of Chicago\u2019s prestigious Committee on Social Thought.\nThe week before, he bought a used .32-caliber Colt revolver and dropped out of sight.\nWishnetsky entered the sanctuary that morning just as Rabbi Adler was completing his sermon, following a bar mitzvah. About 1,000 people are believed to have been present, including 125 visitors from an interfaith group, the assassin's mother, and Goldie Adler, the rabbi\u2019s wife.\nAdler got everyone else"}

Simply go to the website and start chatting in the pop-up window on the right side of the screen.\nStudents have dozens of file transfer apps, online storage lockers, and document creation helpers to assist them through the school year. But the plentiful technological opportunities can become problematic when you have to search through all those third-party solutions to find misplaced files.\nAdvertised as a \u201csmart search assistant,\u201d Findo sorts through emails, computers, personal clouds, and more to retrieve desired files.\nThe aptly named FindoBot is the chatbot aspect of Findo. It integrates with services like Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Slack, and delivers search results directly into those interfaces to save time.\nAstro is what results when artificial intelligence enhances email. It works with Android and iOS platforms, plus Mac computers and even Alexa. Students can connect it with any Gmail or Office 365 email account and enjoy features like an AI-powered priority inbox, which tells them which emails to read first, and a snooze function that empowers students to respond to some emails later.\nWhen unread newsletters start clogging up an inbox, the bot can send reminders about unsubscribing to mailing lists that generate emails you no longer want to get.\nThere\u2019s also a mute feature you might use when an email conversation shared among dozens of classmates gets too chaotic to follow constantly. Customized notifications when emails arrive eliminate unnecessary distractions, too.\nSo, what does the Astro chatbot do? It monitors users\u2019 email habits in the background.

As reported by Think Progress' Amanda Terkel, ABEC sponsored the recent Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina during which (surprise, surprise) no questions about global warming were raised by CNN's moderators.\n\"ABEC also co-sponsored November's CNN/YouTube debates in Nevada and Florida, at which no questions about global warming were asked . . . What is ABEC receiving in return for its support of CNN's debate? Besides branding on tv and newspaper ads, ThinkProgress has learned that at November's Democratic debate in Nevada, ABEC was given a special area near the debate's entrance to hand out \"clean coal\" brochures. No other organizations were allowed to distribute materials in that prime area.\"\nABEC has so far spent close to $1.3 million \"on billboard, newspaper, television and radio ads in Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina\" (you can see their TV ad from the debate on the ThinkProgress website); at this rate, one can imagine that it will likely spend several millions more before the real presidential election gets underway."}

These are stocks of companies that are projected to increase revenue and profit by at least 12% in the coming year and rank near the top all stocks rated by our proprietary quantitative model, which looks at more than 60 factors.\nIn addition, the stocks must be followed by at least one financial analyst who posts estimates on the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. Please note that definitions of revenue vary by industry, and this screen does not make adjustments for acquisitions, which can materially affect posted results. Likewise, earnings-per-share growth may be affected by accounting charges, share repurchases and other one-time items.\nFirst up is Albemarle ( ALB - Get Report), which develops, manufactures and markets specialty chemicals around the world. It has been rated a buy since March 2005. The company's strengths include notable return on equity, impressive increases in net income and a compelling record of EPS growth.\nThese strengths outweigh the company's low profit margins. Albemarle's stock has shown a dramatic appreciation, making it relatively more expensive compared with its industry peers. However, its other strengths justify the higher price levels.\nVolvo ( VOLV sold its car business to Ford in 1999 but still makes trucks, buses, construction equipment and aircraft engine parts. It has been rated a buy since March 2005.\nOil and gas transportation company Oneok Partners ( OKS has maintained a buy rating since June 2006. The company has recently acquired valuable natural gas and processing assets, which reduce its dependence on regulated fee-based transportation revenue.\nOneok shows impressive revenue growth and return on equity that is significantly higher than that of the industry and the S&P 500 averages. The company also has enjoyed impressive net income growth.\nRisks to the buy rating include any unexpected rise in interest rates, which could drag down profits since the company has taken on more debt to fund its aggressive expansion strategy. Oneok is also vulnerable to the risk of compressed gathering and processing margin, which is related to volatile natural gas prices.\nGarmin ( GRMN - Get Report) makes navigation, communications and information devices based on GPS technology. It has been rated a buy since March 2005. The company has shown stellar revenue growth, notable return on equity, a two-year pattern of steady EPS growth and has a minuscule debt-to-equity ratio.\nThough no company is perfect, we do not currently see any weaknesses that are likely to detract from the generally rosy outlook.\nSince Cummins operates in various competitive geographical markets, the buy rating is dependent on the economic conditions of the automotive, construction and general industrial sectors. Growth prospects would likewise be dimmed by any decline in margins or return on equity.\nReal estate and money management service company Jones Lang LaSalle ( JLL has had a buy rating since March 2005. The company has impressive strengths, including a noteworthy return on equity (a sign of internal strength), impressive net operating cash flow and a significant appreciation of its share price, which should continue to move higher.\nWith positive investment measures across the board, the company's low profit margins are not a major concern.\nRated a buy since March 2005, BG Group ( BRG produces, transmits and supplies natural gas to more than 20 countries worldwide.

As of the 2018-19 season, the Dragons feature five players from the area between their boys and girls programs.\nStarting the trend was Jen Driscoll, a Westport native who found a home at St. George\u2019s after LaSalle Academy and Bishop Connolly weren\u2019t quite the right fit. Since then, she\u2019s not only gotten more comfortable with the academics and her teammates, but she\u2019s also developed her game in a way she didn\u2019t expect.\nDriscoll\u2019s improvements helped land her the opportunity to come back to the SouthCoast after her prep school career ends to play for Matt Ducharme as a part of the UMass Dartmouth women\u2019s basketball program.\nBut the local impact on the Dragons doesn\u2019t stop at Driscoll, though the 1,000-point scorer has become a big part of the program\u2019s success, averaging seven points, three assists, five rebounds and two steals per game.\nNew Bedford native Chiron Rose, a repeat sophomore, has gotten comfortable at St. George\u2019s, much like Driscoll. However, it wasn\u2019t a quick and easy adjustment being away from home at such a young age. Having a group of like-minded individuals around has helped Rose warm up to her new setting.\nIn addition to being in a new setting and learning to gel with her teammates within the flow of the Dragons' offense, the sophomore is also handling new responsibilities on the court.\nWhile Rose plays the wing on offense, she\u2019s become a post presence on a St. George\u2019s team that lacks height. Despite her 5-foot-6 stature, she\u2019s held her own down low.\nIn her first campaign with St. George\u2019s, Rose is averaging 10 points a game, as well as four rebounds and two assists.\nA Westport native like Driscoll, freshman Laila Silver has found a connection with her team early on. Much like Rose, that\u2019s made her transition to prep school life and prep school basketball much easier.\nBut Silver\u2019s early play has come as a bit of a surprise to her head coach. The freshman was the one incoming player Dullea had not seen prior to school starting in the fall. The freshman quickly turned heads and has inserted herself as an integral part of the team.\nSilver is averaging 7.4 points a game with four rebounds and 1.2 steals.\nOver on the boys side, Dom Mello, a repeat sophomore from Wareham, has found his groove. Though, there have been challenges along the way \u2014 positive challenges, but challenges nonetheless.\nCombined with the points he scored at Wareham, Mello eclipsed the 1,000-point mark this season, an accomplishment he doesn\u2019t take lightly.\nFrom the start, Mello has impressed St. George\u2019s boys basketball coach Dwayne Pina \u2014 a New Bedford native and the brother of Whalers girls basketball coach Jordan Pina \u2014 becoming the motor that makes the Dragons go.\nMello is averaging 17.3 points per night with a season-high of 39 points against the Groton School on Jan. 5.

First, Trump\u2019s commission on \u201celection integrity\u201d\u2014a group led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach\u2014sent letters to election officials in every state demanding extremely detailed information about registered voters, including \u201caddresses, dates of birth, political party [and the] last four digits of social security number if available.\u201d Second, in what\u2019s being seen as a prelude to litigation aimed at purging voter rolls, the Department of Justice requested that states answer questions about what steps they\u2019ve taken to comply with the National Voter Registration Act, which requires states to maintain accurate voter lists by removing people who are ineligible or dead.\nFor civil rights leaders who spent the George W. Bush years fighting against Republican-led efforts to make it harder for people to vote, these developments were deeply worrying on their own. But the Trump administration wasn\u2019t done: On Thursday night, the White House announced it was adding Hans von Spakovsky to the Pence-Kobach commission.\nVon Spakovsky has done more than anyone else to bring unfounded fears about voter fraud into the mainstream of Republican discourse. A former member of the Federal Election Commission, Von Spakovsky served under Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft as the de facto head of the voting section in the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. In that capacity, he distinguished himself as an exceptionally zealous believer in the idea that widespread voter fraud exists and must be dealt with urgently through aggressive purging of voter rolls and strict voter ID laws.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something in the water he\u2019s been drinking \u2026 but over the years he\u2019s been hellbent to make it more difficult\u2014always, always\u2014for people to vote.

{"idx": "19657", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A ComScore Networks study estimated that nearly 80% of all online purchases start at a major search engine. Search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN can help to bring visitors to your site, but that is only the first step; once visitors arrive on your landing page, the site must keep the momentum going and ultimately convert the visitor to a customer. Landing page targeting and testing -- or a combination of both -- enables you to optimize how your site speaks to your visitors.\nThe core of any Web marketing campaign is the ability to serve landing pages with content that is relevant to its visitors. This targeted content allows the visitor to quickly and easily find what they are looking for on your site through a search engine. For pay-per-click campaigns, landing page URLs can be specified for each ad, group, keyword or creative.\nTargeting allows you to show site visitors different content that is based on their segment. In search engine marketing, the segment is typically defined by the search keyword, or keyword group. For instance, the \"cd/dvd\" segment includes searches for \"dvd player,\" \"cd player,\" \"blu ray,\" \"hd dvd,\" and so on. Visitors clicking through from any of these search queries are then directed to a specific, targeted landing page such as the DVD category or product page. By immediately presenting visitors with content and products they are interested in, you have created a win-win situation. Visitors don't have to spend time trying to navigate to the content they are interested in, and you have brought them one step closer to a conversion.\nBeyond targeting your site to tailor the needs of your visitors, it is important that you continually test and optimize your landing pages to ensure their effectiveness at compelling visitors to take a specific action. Whether testing a single factor like the page's heading (an A/B test), or testing multiple factors at the same time like headline, promotion, and head shot (a multivariate test), the objective is to learn which page version not only gets the visitor's attention, but holds it as well. Multivariate tests provide another interesting benefit: they enable you to isolate the influence that each individual page element has on visitor response, thus revealing the \"behavioral levers\" contained within your site's content.\nFor example, if several visitors ran a search for \"snowboard\" through a search engine and they chose to click on your link through the results of the query, each visitor would be shown a different version of your landing page.

The reduction is even more stark when compared to the private sector, where 97% of schools make languages compulsory right up to the age of 16.\nThe findings are worrying for the future of the British economy, according to the director of CILT, Isabella Moore. She said: \"This will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of British business. With 70% of businesses now involved in some form of international activity the idea that languages are just for 'academic' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy.\"\nThe survey, conducted in conjunction with the Association for Language Learning (ALL) and based on findings from 800 state schools and 180 independent schools, also found that only 41% of students in the schools where languages are voluntary actually take up the opportunity.\nCertain languages are also suffering, with 72% of state schools reporting a drop in the learning of French and a 70% drop in German, though uptake of Spanish has risen by 44%.\nThe survey also suggested regional variations. In the north, only 23% of schools made languages compulsory after the age of 14. In the midlands, the figure is 29%, while in southern England, including London, the figure is 36%.\nA spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) said that more opportunities for younger children meant they would want to carry on studying languages in later life.\n\"Already almost half of primary schools are offering language learning compared to a fifth in 2001,\" he said.\n\"This will lead to increasing numbers of children learning languages throughout their school careers and beyond.\"\nThe DfES also criticised the report for ignoring the 200 schools which specialised in language teaching in its survey."}

America has about 100 of those still operating. And it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to get more.\nThe average of an American nuclear plant is about 36 years old, and then things wear out. So they\u2019re closing much faster than they\u2019re being built. We only have two being built in America, and there\u2019s seven or eight in the hopper to be closed. So they\u2019re too expensive to build new, and the trend is to shut them down.\nErnest Moniz: I believe there\u2019s little doubt that we will be heading towards a very low carbon future. Most especially, we will see the energy sector largely de-carbonizing. Nuclear has to be viewed in that context as one of the options along with wind and solar, other renewables, possibly even using coal with carbon capture and sequester.\nIn the United States, nuclear up to now has been responsible for over 60 percent of the carbon-free electricity that we produce. So nuclear certainly has a track record as advancing a low carbon economy. Internationally, we see it growing.\nBut there are big challenges. The challenges have come \u2014 especially in Europe and the United States \u2014 in building the next generation of reactors. We have had some pretty significant cost overruns that price extremely challenging for that future.\nJerome McDonnell: Are you surprised people don\u2019t get as worked up about nuclear these days?\nGundersen: Yes, it certainly amazes me. I thought that after the disaster of Fukushima Daiichi, people would say \u201cenough is enough.\u201d And I sort of looked at them as bookends \u2014 we have Hiroshima on one side and Fukushima on the other, and that should bracket the nuclear age.\nTo a degree in the United States, it\u2019s done that. But worldwide, it has not. Even in Japan, it has not. I don\u2019t understand \u2014 having witnessed the devastation of a disaster \u2014 that people would want to double down on nuclear.\nMoniz: The risk of a nuclear weapon being used somewhere in the world in these next years is probably higher than it\u2019s been since the Cuban missile crisis, as we see concerns in North Korea, India,"}

A barrel horse rider in rodeos, where she got her first education in country, Sandy biked Route 66 when it was in it\u2019s infancy. In later years, she worked as a freelance photo journalist and also with Claddagh Records, where she met and was quite friendly with Garech de Br\u00fan. Also Davey Spillane\u2019s Atlantic Bridge album was rehearsed and devised in her living room in Dalkey.\nWe have heard her described as a fountain of knowledge for music, especially American Country Music, but Sandy was way more than that. I worked with her for nearly 15 years, and was truly amazed every day with the knowledge she had on any subject \u2013 music in all it\u2019s genres, homeopathy, gardening. she devoured books at an amazing rate - but I knew to never get her started on American politics or gun control!!\nThe best illustration of her knowledge is a story of the time Sandy and I went up to the Bronte Centre in Co. Down, to interview J.D. Souther, one of the songwriters for The Eagles and Linda Ronstadt, to name just two.\nWhen we got there, the promoter Andy Peters told us that JD had just flown back fro Texas after burying his father, and was continuing the tour. Sandy and I both said we would not intrude on his time before a gig and that we would do it another time. JD insisted we go for dinner with him \u2013 so the four of us sat down and Andy and I sat for the next 2 hours dumbfounded by the lecture we got from the two of them on American music and it\u2019s impact on American history and society.\nI think they started somewhere in the American Civil War, then went to jazz, bluegrass, American classical music to Bernstein and beyond. JD sat in awe of her knowledge, and they became good email pals afterwards \u2013 in fact we were told that one famous Country guitar player's sole ambition in coming to Ireland was to meet the woman who put a smile on JD Souther!\nI remember her winning the CMA Foreign Presenter Award, and Brad Paisley coming to present it. The award got held up in customs and they had such craic pretending my zoom mic was the award for photos, that when it did arrive a few weeks later Brad made a point of coming back to officially hand it to her.\nSandy was just the sweetest, funniest, smartest girl. And girl she was, 76 or no, with a twinkly eye and a mischievous laugh. It was a privilege to call her friend. Our world is a colder place without her.\nSandy was not, by her own admission, a \u2018professional\u2019 interviewer - and she wasn\u2019t.

Sacramento levied 1,137 fines for wasting water from April to September, the latest data available. Nonetheless, water conservation officials said they aren\u2019t out to collect revenue; the idea behind drought school is to get residents to learn from their mistakes.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take their money; we just want them to follow the rules,\u201d said Maureen Coulson, a conservation project manager.\nThe Sacramento Regional Water Authority runs a similar program, called \u201cwater school,\u201d on behalf of 16 area water agencies. Attendees must pass a five-part quiz to get their fines waived, although program director Amy Talbot acknowledged the test isn\u2019t too difficult.

Third and fourth offenses bring fines of $200 and $1,000, respectively, and won\u2019t be waived.\nCrnogorac and his fellow instructor, Paul Brown, showed the students slides of the snowpack disappearing over the years from Half Dome and charts explaining Sacramento\u2019s water-consumption patterns, and he provided them with tips on how to fix leaky toilets and ensure their sprinklers don\u2019t shower the street.\nFully 60 percent of Sacramento\u2019s water use goes to outdoor irrigation, Brown said, reminding students that Sacramentans are limited to watering their lawns just once a week starting Sunday. He and Crnogorac urged the students to take advantage of the city\u2019s rebate programs for low-flow toilets, washing machines and smart controllers for their sprinklers.\nAll in all, things went swimmingly.

{"idx": "19682", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Rick Robinson: The former DSO member formed CutTime Productions LLC.\nRick Robinson is bringing classical music to the masses -- which may be one of the most challenging jobs in all of music.\nThe former Detroit Symphony Orchestra bassist has loved classical music all his life, and it frustrated him that the genre struggled to find new fans. He couldn't understand why the sounds that moved him so deeply should be cooped up in grand concert halls and churches, inaccessible to new audiences.\n\"I grew up in a musical family going back five generations,\" Robinson said. \"My mother played piano when she got home from work to relax; my older brother and sister played and had so much fun that I couldn't wait to grow up and study music in school. I just started hearing the wealth of beautiful music and how it took me on adventures. It comforts us with a sense of inevitability, and it's that kind of contrast that I want to share with as many people as possible.\"\nSo Robinson formed CutTime Players in 1995, an eight-piece ensemble of DSO musicians who could take symphonic music out into the nightlife. He started by transcribing and adapting classical works for the group and then began writing his own original works that blend classical with urban pop. It was just a side gig, keeping him busy when he wasn't at the DSO.\nBut when the symphony went on strike in 2010, Robinson was able to turn his attention to the company, CutTime Productions LLC, more consistently. He launched a Detroit chapter of the \"Classical Revolution\" movement and began a monthly revue of artists at Detroit area restaurants and coffeehouses. At the gatherings, they would perform and explore the nature of classical music and what makes it classical.\n\"We're really in the inspiration business,\" Robinson said. \"It's how we set the context for this musical style that inspires people as much as the music. People are very surprised to see a black man advocating and explaining classical music.\"\nIn 2011, he faced a serious rethinking of his life. His father passed away, and it gave Robinson the courage to jump into entrepreneurship full time. He now writes and arranges tours and records, organizes classes and works with various nonprofits. For example, he'll be playing New Center Park on Thursdays, June through August, for Midtown Detroit Inc.\n\"The industry really needs new ideas and new ways to reach new audiences,\" Robinson said. \"I can work as a guest artist or consultant or publishing my arrangements and compositions to help the industry at the same time as make a living.\"\nBusiness has been steady, but the life of a musician is never a windfall. In 2012, CutTime posted revenue of $20,000, up from $15,000 in 2011.\nEventually Robinson would like to grow enough to hire a few employees -- \"I need an agent and PR person,\" he said jokingly, \"and I'm certainly a better artist than accountant\" -- because he spends two-thirds of his time traveling. In the future, he'd like to be stable and able to work consistently in Detroit and Chicago."}

Playing them is more the classic emerging market game of knowing when to jump off,\" said Cameron Brandt, international markets editor at EmergingPortfolio.com.\n\"What we've tended to see over the past nine months is that fund managers are maintaining some positions there, but tending to take the profits when they're on offer,\" he added.\nUnlike in Europe, which has had plenty of political drama this year, it's often difficult in Latin America to separate economic fundamentals from politics. \"Politics tend to end up on the doorstep of companies in a direct way,\" Brandt said.\nBrazil, Mexico and Chile are considered least susceptible, but Venezuela's increasingly militarized government and Argentina's unfriendly capital controls are a reminder of how politics can interfere with investments in the region, he added.\nStill, Latin America funds have weathered upheaval surprisingly well so far this year. The average fund rose 9.7% through June 15, according to investment research firm Morningstar.\nIndividual investors evidently don't share professional managers' sobering outlook. About $350 million in new money flowed into Latin America funds so far this year, according to data firm Lipper Inc., far outpacing the $250 million these funds collected in 2004.\nBrazil accounts for 51% of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Latin America Index, followed by 33% to Mexico and about 10% to Chile.\nYet Brazil has been a rollercoaster for investors lately. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government is embroiled in a corruption scandal, with accusations of accepting bribes in exchange for legislative support. The scandal appeared to have cooled this week when a key witness recanted testimony and said Lula wasn't directly involved in the scheme, but investors remain on guard for surprises.\nEmergingPortfolio's Brandt said investors in Brazil are also concerned that political tensions may make it difficult for the government to push through needed fiscal reforms before elections slated for the end of 2006.\nGonzalo Pangaro, manager of the T. Rowe Price Latin America Fund PRLAX, +0.46% said there could be a silver lining to Brazil's political turmoil if it produces an even more transparent government and solidifies Brazilian institutions.\nA key risk in Brazil is whether Lula will be re-elected. With interest rates approaching 20%, the economy slowing and his popularity sagging, Lula could be pressured to adopt a more populist agenda, Pangaro said.\n\"We're not currently pounding the table on the region, but still think there's upside for investors with long-term focus who are aware of the risk and natural volatility,\" he said. \"The current sell-off is a good chance to slowly add positions.\"\nAmong Pangaro's favorite companies is Natura Cosmetics"}

{"idx": "19697", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: What is the best possible five-man power-play unit that could be assembled from active NHL players? We answered that question, building a unit based on each player's underlying numbers.\nAll statistics are in 5-on-4 situations only, sourced from HockeyAnalysis.com, and calculated over the past three seasons. Any rankings include only players who have played at least 300 minutes over that span.\nBased on the scoring boost the Blue Jackets get when their captain is on the ice with the man-advantage, Foligno, 29, is statistically the best choice at his position.\nColumbus has averaged 9.27 goals per 60 minutes when Foligno has been on the ice, and 5.44 when he hasn't. Among forwards, that difference of 3.83 extra goals per 60 minutes is the biggest positive difference in the League.\nTactically, Foligno's role is to stand in front of the net, create traffic, screen shots, and score on deflections and rebounds. His average of 6.36 points per 60 minutes ranks second, behind the next player on this unit.\nBackstrom, 29, leads the NHL with an average of 7.34 points per 60 minutes and has been a big part of Washington's power-play scoring, as measured by the individual points percentage (IPP) statistic. That is the percentage of all on-ice scoring for which the player had either a goal or an assist.\nBackstrom ranks third among forwards with an IPP of 79.4 percent, behind Marian Hossa of the Chicago Blackhawks (82.4) and Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning (79.5).\nVoracek, 27, was selected to increase the shot volume of this power-play unit. The Flyers have averaged 125.6 shot attempts per 60 minutes with Voracek on the ice, which ranks fourth among forwards. That is an increase of 28.1 over the Flyers' rate when he's not on the ice (97.5) and is second among forwards to Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins (34.6).\nVoracek's contribution to these shot volumes is reflected in his average of 31.6 shots on goal per 60 minutes, which ranks seventh among forwards.\nThis may be the easiest selection to make, because there are few statistical categories where Shattenkirk, 28, does not lead NHL defensemen at 5-on-4 by a wide margin.\nHis average of 6.84 points per 60 minutes is 1.60 points better than that of Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman, who is second (5.24).\nThe Capitals and St. Louis Blues averaged 9.78 goals per 60 minutes with Shattenkirk on the ice, 1.05 higher than the second-best figure, the Capitals' average of 8.73 with defenseman Matt Niskanen on the ice. That 9.78 average also represents an NHL-leading scoring boost of 3.47 goals per 60 minutes above the average scoring rate for Shattenkirk's team when he wasn't on the ice (6.31).

Another key figure - Salah Abdeslam - was arrested on 18 March after going on the run.\nMohamed Abrini, another suspect believed to have links to the Paris attack, was arrested in Brussels on 8 April.\nThis is what we know about the suspects, and what the authorities have accused them of doing.\nThe 26-year-old French national, who was born in Brussels, was wounded and arrested during a police raid in the Molenbeek area of the city on 18 March.\nPolice had been hunting him since the 13 November attacks, warning members of the public not to approach him.\nOn 15 March, Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in a flat in the southern Brussels district of Forest. Belgian prosecutors told the BBC at the time that it was not clear when he had been there, because the fingerprints could not be dated.\nOn 10 December police found one of his fingerprints, traces of TATP (acetone peroxide) explosives and three handmade belts - apparently for explosives - in an apartment in the city's Schaerbeek district.\nThe apartment had been rented in a false name. It is thought that the Belgians among the suicide attackers picked up their belts there before going to Paris. Salah Abdeslam is thought to have returned immediately after the attacks.\nHe is believed to have rented a VW Polo car in Belgium, which was later found near the Bataclan concert hall where 89 people were killed. But he also rented a Renault Clio and reserved two hotel rooms outside Paris before the attacks.\nHis precise role in the attacks themselves is unclear, although his brother Brahim blew himself up.\nInvestigators believe Salah Abdeslam may have driven the three bombers who attacked the Stade de France to their destination and may have been given the job of an attack a short distance south, in the 18th district. That attack never happened.\nHours after the 13 November attacks, Salah Abdeslam was in a VW Golf with two other men near the Belgian border when they were stopped at least once by police.\nThey were allowed to drive on after checks. It is unclear whether French authorities had matched Abdeslam's name to the car found at the Bataclan by the time he was stopped.\nAs the search for Salah Abdeslam intensified in Belgium, Brussels went into lockdown and his brother, Mohamed, appealed for him to give himself up.\nSalah Abdeslam's past is littered with convictions for petty crime. Belgian prosecutors said they had questioned him and his brother Brahim earlier in 2015.\nSome reports have said he spent time in prison for robbery where he met suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud. He had earlier been sacked as a technician on the Brussels tram system, for missing work.\nDutch police said they had detained Salah Abdeslam briefly in February, fining him \u20ac70 (\u00a349) for possession of cannabis.\nOn 27 April 2016, he was extradited to France, where he faces charges in connection"}

It's been a monumental year for Jenkins and Larson, who have attracted big publicity for their roles in the superhero movie universe. Jenkins, of course, scaled new heights at the helm of Wonder Woman, which in its No. 1 opening weekend earlier this month took in more than $223 million globally ($100 million of that domestically), making it the biggest opening for a female director; while Larson continues to prep for the titular role of the MCU's Captain Marvel, which will be the first MCU film to be co-directed by a female (Anna Boden, along with Ryan Fleck).\nCelebrating new and looking ahead to future success for females in the Marvel and DC movie universes, the filmmaker and actress recently reached out to each other on Twitter this week to show some love for each other's accomplishments.\nLarson is the latest of a smattering of Marvel Studios stars to reach out to Jenkins in the wake of her blistering success with the first Wonder Woman solo movie. Previously, Avengers stars Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo congratulated Jenkins on Wonder Woman's success, as did Black Panther's Lupita Nyong'o, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's Karen Gillan, and Daredevil's Vincent D'Onofrio.\nRetweet if you desperately wanna give @PattyJenks a massive hug.\nWhile Marvel and DC fans have long been rivals in staunch defense of their superhero favorites, it's great to see that within the movie industry, actors and filmmakers are being supportive of each other's projects no matter what comic book brand their characters originated from. Perhaps the greatest example of how two filmmakers put the rivalry between their studio projects aside came last week when Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige and DC's Geoff Johns paid tribute to their friend and mentor, Superman director Richard Donner.\nDoes this mean the rivalry between Marvel and DC fans will ever soften? Probably not. In fact, some would probably argue that it intensified when The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron filmmaker Joss Whedon announced earlier this year that he was crossing over to DC to write and direct Batgirl. But even then, Whedon, out of an act of respect for Fiege, called the filmmaker to inform him of his big move to DC before it was announced to the public.\nClearly people like Jenkins, Larson, Fiege, Johns, and Whedon realize that as much as their studios' product may compete against each other, it's a form of healthy competition to always remind them that they need to be at the top of their game in hopes of making the next great superhero movie. Competition, after all, is what keeps the genre so alive and vibrant."}

The regional group issued a report last month identifying services needed by the area's Jews, and hopes to eventually find ways to provide them.\nIf Jewish institutions meet the social service needs of unaffiliated Jews, their \"next logical step\" will be to join a synagogue, said William Bernstein, director of the southern region.\nBut Rabbi Eli Hecht of the orthodox Chabad of South Bay in Lomita does not agree that lack of services or institutions is causing Jews in the area to drift away from organized religion. Hecht sees non-affiliation as part of a Southern California phenomenon that puts extraordinary stress on families to gain material possessions at the expense of religious commitment.\n\"People who were busy getting involved going up the ladder had to sacrifice certain things,\" Hecht said. \"When you go up the ladder, there's sometimes not enough time to re-evaluate what your needs are until it's too late. Now that the community is assimilating so much, they're getting very guilt-ridden because of all of these tragedies that are happening--of intermarriages within the community and the high percentage of divorce. They think the federation will be able to fill this void, which I doubt.\"\nHecht said he believes the report is aimed primarily at getting more funding. Bernstein acknowledged that more money will be needed to implement the report's recommendations.\nThe report includes statistics gathered by the federation in a 1979 study of the nearly 40,000 Jews then estimated to be in the area, which encompasses 960 square miles bounded roughly by El Segundo, Palos Verdes, San Pedro and Huntington Park.\n- Only 20% were affiliated with one of the seven synagogues in the area.\n- 48% had never belonged to a synagogue.\n- 75% were not members of any other Jewish organization.\n- 38% of the respondents had married a non-Jew. That is significant because among Jews in general there is an extremely low affiliation rate among the intermarried, Bernstein said.\n- Median income, $28,823 in 1979, was about 15% higher than that of other Jews in the Los Angeles area. \"The more affluent you are, the less likely you are to affiliate,\" said Lisa Kalson, a federation spokeswoman.\n- 15% were divorced or separated, more than the proportion found among Jews in other parts of the Los Angeles area.\nAlthough the statistics are six years old, Bernstein said the regional group believes they are still accurate. \"I think we're on solid ground,\" he said.\nThe report was prompted by plans for a new southern region office building at Palos Verdes and Lomita boulevards in Lomita, scheduled for ground breaking in August and completion in December, said Rabbi David Lieb of the reform Temple Beth-El in San Pedro. It will house the offices of Jewish social service organizations like Jewish Family Service, Jewish Big Brothers and the Jewish Community Centers Assn., and will have room for classes and other activities.\n\"When you build a new physical structure, you kind of step back and analyze what you're going to put in it and (how to) make use of that facility,\" Lie"}

Proponents argued that the national conscience demanded such a law because discrimination posed a moral crisis. Proponents and opponents of the CRA differed sharply on the role of federal law in addressing prejudice and discrimination. While proponents recognized the limits of what law could achieve, they argued that the CRA would remove artificial barriers created by segregation that constrained normal or natural human interaction. Opponents defended segregation as natural, Biblical, and part of the created order and warned that the CRA would usher in a dangerous and forced racial intermingling and line-crossing, particularly in marriage. Similar to the social scientists of the late 1940s and 1950s, supporters or the CRA appealed to experience with local and state antidiscrimination law and the World War II-era Fair Employment Practice Committee. The Article concludes with reflections on the present-day implications of this earlier \u201clegislating morality\u201d debate for controversies over LGBT rights and the evident clash between conscience, or religious liberty, on the one hand, and antidiscrimination law and marriage equality, on the other.\nLinda McClain, The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 'Legislating Morality': On Conscience, Prejudice, and Whether 'Stateways' Can Change 'Folkways', 95 Boston University Law Review 891 (2015)."}

With Americans rallying around the flag, the pundits proclaimed, Hollywood had to stop running down the country and offer more positive images of the American way of life.\nThen along came The Osbournes, a true pop cult phenomenon. America's new TV hero is a Brit from Birmingham, former lead singer of the heavy metal group Black Sabbath, with a dysfunctional family that makes the Simpsons look like the Cleavers. Although I wouldn't question Ozzy's patriotism, he was once caught urinating on the Alamo. And yet, for the moment, he's got the most talked about show on television. Go figure.\nThe bottom line is the viewing public likes a show because its characters are likable despite all their foul language and vulgar behavior. In fact, they fit the tried-and-true formula for a television family, epitomized most recently by Fox's Malcolm in the Middle. There\u2019s the weak but lovable father (Ozzy), the strong-willed but caring mother (Sharon), and the obnoxious but witty children (Jack and Kelly). If you take away the curse words, the Osbournes are like any other TV family, regularly coming apart and knitting back together in convenient 30-minute chunks.\nLike many TV shows criticized for undermining family values, The Osbournes in its own way upholds them, but with an added twist: the Osbourne family is for real. What seems to have struck a chord in the viewing audience is the feeling that\u2013 for once on TV\u2013 we're seeing how people actually behave with each other at home. The Osbournes is thus a strange mixture: part sitcom, part reality show.\nThat's why it's fitting that MTV has scored its greatest ratings success ever with The Osbournes. Someone there had the bright idea \"Let's take celebrities and turn them into ordinary people.\" Week after week we get to see that Ozzy may be rich and famous, but deep down, his lifestyle is not essentially different from ours. He and his family may be swimming in material possessions, but they still face the same problems we do. Even in Beverly Hills, there are dogs to be cleaned up after, and in Ozzy's household, he's apparently the man for the job.\nWhat The Osbournes does so cleverly is to mold the daily life of a real family into the standard plot lines of traditional sitcoms. Thus we end up with the best of both worlds. When viewed today, a 1950s-era sitcom inevitably seems old-fashioned and even sappy. With The Osbournes we can feel we're viewing something on the cutting edge and yet still see the nuclear family as an institution that is not outdated.\nTake the episode that aired April 23 titled \"No Vagrancy.\" This half hour combined two of the most venerable Leave It to Beaver plots: 1) Beaver brings home a stray dog, and 2) Wally brings home a stray Eddie Haskell.\nIn this case, Jack played the roles of both Wally and the Beav, and Eddie was replaced by an equally obnoxious pro skateboarder. But the real fun was watching Ozzy play Ward Cleaver. Here was the one-time scourge of the bat kingdom speaking up on"}

He too could face the death penalty if convicted.\nMalvo's attorneys have indicated in pre-trial proceedings that they intend to argue it is Muhammad who indoctrinated Malvo. Muhammad's lawyers have maintained that Malvo is able to make his own decisions.\nOne of the murder counts against Muhammad is an \u201canti-terrorism\u201d law crafted after the September 11 attacks.

Twombly had lived in Italy since 1957.\nTwombly was known for his abstract works combining painting and drawing techniques, repetitive lines, scribbles and the use of words and graffiti. He is often linked to the legendary American artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, whom he met as a student in New York in the early 1950s.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s making sculpture or working across canvas or making small drawings with quite elaborate and detailed elements in them, you have this very strong sense of the physical presence of these paintings and sculptures, and you have the sense of an artist at work,\u201d the Tate\u2019s director Nicholas Serota said in an in-house interview ahead of a 2008 show of his work.\nThough recognition came late for his work \u2014 and he was often overshadowed by the famous company he kept, like Johns and Rauschenberg \u2014 Twombly was asked to paint a ceiling of the Louvre museum in Paris in 2010, the first artist given the honor since Georges Braque in the 1950s.\nFor that work he chose something simple: a deep blue background punctuated with floating disks and emblazoned with the names of sculptors from ancient Greece, apt for a gallery of bronzes.\n\u201cI got into something new in old age,\u201d he said of his choice of color, which was unusual.\nThe Lexington, Virginia-born artist said he was inspired by the colors he found in a Chinese print as well the blue of early Italian Renaissance artist Giotto, who used paint made from lapis lazuli.\n\u201cI was just thinking of the blue with the disks on it, it\u2019s totally abstract. \u2026 It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Twombly told The Associated Press at the time.\nSimple or not, his work fetched millions at auction: An untitled Twombly painting set an auction record for the artist at a 2002 Sotheby\u2019s sale, fetching (euro) 5.6 million. Before that, a 1990 Christie\u2019s auction set a record for Twombly, with his 1971 untitled blackboard painting going for $5.5 million.\nHis canvases also ignited the passions of his followers. In 2007, a woman was arrested in France for kissing an all-white canvas he painted, worth about $2 million. Restorers had trouble getting the lipstick off, and she was ordered to pay hundreds of dollars to the owner and the gallery \u2014 and $1.50 to the artist himself.\nBorn Edwin Parker Twombly in 1928, the artist got his nickname from his father, who was a baseball player for the Chicago White Sox and had been called Cy after another famous slugger, \u201cCyclone\u201d Young. Eventually Twombly Jr. got the same nickname.\nBetween 1942-46, he studied modern European art under Pierre Daura, a Spanish artist who was living in his hometown of Lexington, according to a catalog for a 2009 Twombly exhibit in Rome organized by the Tate Modern and Rome\u2019s"}

A new study implies that less-than-lethal lead concentrations might make that behavior worse.\nWhile not all city dwellers realize it, we share our environs with hundreds of wild avian species, from migratory warblers just passing through to the starlings and mockingbirds pecking at our trash. But urban areas also generate pollution that can harm animals in surprising ways. A team of researchers has now found one more obscure consequence.\n\u201cWhile immediate effects on [urban wildlife\u2019s] health are of major concern, these results show that lead pollution can have subtler but potentially just as serious effects in the long term through changes to their behavior,\u201d Stephanie McClelland, a postgraduate research student at the Royal Holloway University of London in the UK, told Earther.\nHumans have curtailed their lead use, but the remaining effects of lead pollution are still visible in cities or in places where hunters hunt with lead bullets. Scientists are mostly aware of lead exposure\u2019s effects on humans, which include mental impairment, irritability, developmental delays and kidney disorder, and know it can be fatal to humans and birds alike. But it isn\u2019t clear how less-than-fatal quantities of lead, like lead in the soil, can impact wildlife.\nThe researchers used the common, city-dwelling northern mockingbird as their test subject, focusing on three neighborhoods in New Orleans: Lakeshore, Marigny, and Uptown. Lakeshore\u2019s lead content is around two to 49 milligrams of lead per kilogram of soil, while Marigny and Uptown\u2019s lead levels were 300 to 500 milligrams per kilogram\u2014below the US standards for soil but straddling the acceptable upper limit for play areas. The team captured 34 birds on the sites combined, and sampled the birds\u2019 blood and feathers. They also recorded male mockingbird songs in the areas, and introduced a taxidermy mount of a mockingbird in an aggressive position and measured how the birds reacted.\nThe test results revealed that lead levels were four times higher higher in both blood and feather samples for the birds in the higher lead areas than in the lower-lead areas. The birds\u2019 songs didn\u2019t differ, nor did their apparent body size, but the birds in higher-lead areas behaved more aggressively to the taxidermy intruder than they did in the lower-lead area, according to the paper published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.\nOne researcher not involved in the study appreciated its broad scope. \u201cThey did a great job evaluating the effects of lead, the birds\u2019 position, singing, and aggressive behavior,\u201d Nicole Michel, senior quantitative ecologist for the National Audubon Society, told Earther.

But that is significantly short of the department's target of 67 percent, according to the report.\nThe Institute of Medicine also found issues with the way active members of the military dealing with PTSD are treated. It described the Department of Defense's treatment programs as \"ad hoc, incremental, and crisis-driven, with little planning devoted to the development of a long-range approach to obtaining desired outcomes.\"\nTogether, the two departments spent nearly $3.3 billion in 2012 to treat patients with PTSD. And while both are making strides to identify and treat people with PTSD, many obstacles remain before they will have an \"integrated and higher-performing\" system, the report said.\nOne of the biggest problems is a lack of data to measure which treatments patients are receiving and whether the patients are getting better, said the study's chairman, Sandro Galea of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\"Given that the DOD and VA are responsible for serving millions of service members, families, and veterans, we found it surprising that no PTSD outcome measures are used consistently to know if these treatments are working or not,\" Galea said. \"They could be highly effective, but we won't know unless outcomes are tracked and evaluated.\"\nGalea said tracking does occur with veterans participating in a specific VA program that involves intensive therapy, but that program serves only 1 percent of veterans who have PTSD, and the data suggest the program yields only modest improvement in symptoms.\nThe VA has come under fire recently because of the troubles some new patients have had getting access to care. The IOM's study has been taking place for years, however. The first phase of study, released in 2012, recommended that soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan undergo annual screening for PTSD and that federal agencies conduct more research into which treatments were working.\nFor active military, the report notes that each service branch has established its own prevention programs, trains its own mental health staff, and has its own programs and services for PTSD treatment. It said the service branches lacked an overarching authority to enforce policies related to preventing, treating and screening for PTSD.\nThe report also said DOD leaders aren't consistently held accountable for implementing policies and programs to manage PTSD effectively.\nChuck Hagel: Veterans Affairs healthcare problems \"just wrong\"\nThe panel pointed out that the VA has at least established minimum care requirements nationally. Still, it's unclear whether staff adheres to the standards.

The company disputes that, he said, but company attorneys could not be reached for comment.\nShe is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn court documents, company officials said that state law merely proscribes procedures for getting married or divorced and that marriage is a private act of no public concern.

Federal water managers worked out a deal with municipalities to keep the river flowing through the Albuquerque stretch and limits kicked in that prevented the storage of water in upstream reservoirs to ensure enough water flowed south to Texas.\nForecasters caution that spring runoff could be weak this year, and Balderas says he is seeking a solution that will keep New Mexicans whole for a few generations.\nBalderas this week provided members of a key legislative committee with an update on the legal battle that has been simmering before the U.S. Supreme Court since 2013.\nTexas is asking that New Mexico stop pumping groundwater along the border so that more of the Rio Grande could flow south to farmers and residents in El Paso. Critics contend the well-pumping depletes the aquifer that would otherwise drain back into the river and flow to Texas.\nArguing that it is meeting its obligations, New Mexico last year filed counterclaims alleging that Texas is violating the interstate compact governing the Rio Grande by allowing unrestricted groundwater pumping and other diversions on its side of the border. This has been a growing concern in the valley and to the east in the Permian Basin, where an oil boom has spurred even more demand for water.\nBalderas contends that groundwater pumping in Texas is depleting surface water that has been delivered to that state before it can ever be used.\nTexas has denied the allegations and is asking the court to dismiss New Mexico\u2019s claims.\nBriefings are scheduled next month and arguments will be made before a special master later this spring. It\u2019ll likely be more than a year before the case goes to trial and even that is expected to take at least four months given the complexity of the issue.\nOne of the questions that could be answered is whether the compact has any bearing on the use of groundwater given its hydrogeological connection to surface water. Such a ruling could affect states\u2019 rights, as New Mexico requires permits for any groundwater use but Texas rules provide the right for landowners to pump and capture whatever is available beneath their property regardless of the effects on neighboring wells.\nBalderas\u2019 office is seeking $4.5 million for the next fiscal year to pay for the ongoing litigation and the team of hydrologists, geologists and historians who will be looking more closely at pumping in New Mexico, Texas and Mexico and how the river\u2019s flows might behave under different weather conditions."}

These grassland plants have a distinct carbon signature in an animal\u2019s teeth.\nApes, on the other hand, such as chimpanzees, do not eat that stuff, said Mark Teaford, co-editor of the Journal of Human Evolution and professor at High Point University, who was not involved in the study.\nAlthough primates have a wide range of plant foods in their diet, their meals broadly fall into the category of leaves, fruits and nuts \u2013 in other words, more \u201cwoody\u201d plants.\nConsidering the similar anatomy of early humans to other primates, Teaford says it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that they would be eating a lot of grasses and sedges.\n\u201cTo be able to look at the isotope work and say, this thing is eating a diet fairly similar to some more recent ones, it\u2019s surprising,\u201d Teaford said.\nAustralopithecus bahrelghazali is the earliest example of a human ancestor who may have been eating grasses and sedges, and it\u2019s more than 1.5 million years older than a previously-identified example of a hominin with this diet.\nTeaford, independent of this new study, does work on the microscopic wear on the teeth of ancient human ancestors. There\u2019s evidence in that line of research also that the diet of our early humans was not quite like that of other primates such as chimpanzees and baboons.\nIt\u2019s possible that these results reflect, instead, that human ancestors were eating animals that were eating grasses and sedges. However, Teaford said that based on the strength of the carbon isotope signal from the fossils, it is probably not based on this indirect consumption of the plants. Also, different kinds of teeth probably would have been required to cut up tough meat.\nMore research should be done to firm up these theories, however.\nThis study is only based on two individuals, and the researchers could only investigate what these early humans ate during the time period when their teeth were forming \u2013 i.e. when they were young, notes Peter Ungar, anthropologist at the University of Arkansas who co-authored a book on the human diet with Teaford.\nBut the results are interesting, and shows that our puzzle of the food choices of early hominids gets more complicated as we add pieces to it, he said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a wake up call to say, how well do we know what our ancestors were eating and how do we know what\u2019s required to be able to eat these foods?\u201d Teaford said.\nThe new food pyramid provides a handy way to make sure your family gets the nutrition they need, no matter the pace of life.

The belief, said national police spokesperson Charity Charamba, was that inside these bombs was some substance called red mercury which fetched millions of dollars on the black market.\nAs the \u201cred mercury\u201d story filtered Zimbabwe\u2019s underworld, \u201centerprising\u201d and unscrupulous fortune-seekers have been on the prowl, buying and selling explosives \u2014 even attempting to extract the \u201cred mercury\u201d, ending up dead or injured in the process.\nPolice say it is fortune-seeking adventures such as these that were most likely the cause of the death of five people at a n\u2019anga\u2019s house in Zengeza last week.\nAn explosion ripped through at least three houses tearing to pieces and burning beyond recognition the 24-year-old traditional healer Speakmore Mandere, businessman Clever Kamudzeya (an ex-police officer), a seven-month-old baby who had been left sleeping by its mother in a separate room and another man whom police have not yet officially identified.\nNewsDay, however, has it on good authority that the \u201cunidentified\u201d fifth victim was a barman at a renowned upmarket hotel in Harare by the name of Stix Chitanha. Our sources said Chitanha, who had been missing from his St Mary\u2019s home for six days, was identified by his wife and brother last Sunday and his remains were buried at his rural home in Hurungwe on Monday.\nBefore the police gave their official position on the cause of the blast, all sorts of superstitious theories flew around, most of them bordering on absurdity, unkind humour, some of them even outright silly. They included stories that black magic lightning was being manufactured when something terribly went wrong resulting in the lightning striking its source.\nOther explanations were that the businessman was trying to get rid of a wealth-making goblin that had become a pest.\nOthers claimed that a money-making concoction was being prepared in a clay pot and the businessman was straddling the cauldron containing red-hot stones when the muti suddenly became too powerful and exploded.\nThis version was meant to explain how the businessman was torn apart at the waist area and also how the clay pot miraculously survived the blast.\nThe rational explanation of a possible bomb blast was unpopular with people who readily embraced the mysterious witchcraft-related causes \u2014 including the famous sandawana theory where a rat-like rodent was supposed to have caused the explosion of the magnitude that destroyed up to 12 houses.\nThe reality, however, according to police investigations, is that there are people going around selling bombs in search of instant riches. Some of the theories in this school of thought are that there are soldiers and or policemen that are stealing explosives, including landmines, grenades, mortar bombs etc from military armouries and reselling them to red mercury merchants.\nWhat this means is that such kinds of explosives may now be found in residential areas awaiting extraction of the red mercury or onward transmission to buyers.

He also insisted he did not need professional counseling to manage his anger.\nIn his first public remarks since Brand's May 15 announcement that Knight would remain the Hoosier coach under ''zero tolerance'' guidelines, the coach conceded he had a problem with his temper, but said he was confident that he could keep it under control.

Two quad-core chips will be available in the second half of the year, the Phenom FX and the Phenom X4, and a dual-core chip based on a similar design called the Phenom X2 will also appear by the end of the year.\nThe Phenom brand will become the moniker for AMD's performance chips going forward, said Leslie Sobon, director of the company's desktop division. The Athlon 64 X2 brand will remain for mainstream chips and Sempron will continue to bring up the rear, she said.\nAMD is banking on its design philosophy behind the Phenom chips and their server counterparts, code-named Barcelona, as a way of making up for Intel's lead in the quad-core processor generation. Intel has been shipping quad-core chips for servers and high-end desktops since last year. Those chips are known as \"multichip modules\" because they are essentially two of Intel's dual-core chips welded together in a package.\nBut AMD chose to build a single chip with four cores, which the company believes will result in better performance because information will not have to leave one core to visit its neighbor. It's the same debate over an integrated memory controller and point-to-point links that propelled AMD's Opteron and Athlon 64 chips to prominence: Cores that are directly linked offer better performance than cores that have to exchange information by leaving the chip.\nIntel contends that by improving the speed and performance of its cache memory and the front-side bus--that off-chip bridge between cores--it can offer excellent performance and sidestep manufacturing concerns. Because AMD has yet to deliver its quad-core chips, the debate is mostly aesthetic, but it could become an important distinction if Barcelona and the Phenom chips open a significant performance advantage over Intel's currently shipping quad-core processors later this year.\nOf course, Intel isn't standing still. It will deliver new quad-core chips later this year, and in 2008, it will introduce chips that incorporate the same integrated memory controller and point-to-point links as AMD's with its Nehalem generation of chips.\nBut AMD is desperate for the Phenom and Barcelona processors to arrive so it can stabilize its average selling prices. The company has been suffering from Intel's lead in the quad-core race, since it has had to aggressively discount its dual-core processors to compete with Intel's offerings, especially in the server arena.\nBarcelona will come first, scheduled for a \"mid-2007\" introduction with systems becoming available over the remainder of the year and into next year. The Phenom processors are scheduled for the second half of the year.\nAround the time of the Phenom launch, AMD will expand upon its \"4x4\" idea from last year with a product code-named FASN8. (The company swears that's not the real name.) FASN8 is designed for the most performance-hungry PC builders out there, with the ability to hold two quad-core Phenom processors, AMD's new ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT graphics chip, and a new chipset.

{"idx": "19744", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Since many employers started offering 401(k) plans back in the early 80\u2019s, millions of employees have taken advantage of this gold nugget and maximized their retirement plans. However, due to the state of the economy and other retirement-based issues, experts have now discovered ways to further maximize this additional retirement safety net so your 401(k) plans go the way you always dreamed.\nSome great strategies for 401(k) plans are discussed on US News money blog, with an article specifically addressing retirement strategies that will further protect you; these include some strategies about 401(k) you may not know about but could really help with retirement plans in the future.\nIn an associated report from this Inquisitr article, Retirement Crisis Looms for the Unprepared, it further drives home the point that workers aren\u2019t saving nearly enough on 401(k) plans, and since cuts to social security and the ever-decreasing pension funds are occurring at alarming rates, these strategies will be even more critical to your 401(k).\nOne such 401(k) strategy that is gaining popularity and importance is not accepting the default savings rate. New employees usually net only 3 percent for their 401(k) plans, so if you put in 3 percent, the company will match your investment. For many people, that may not be enough to secure the same lifestyle into retirement. A good strategy for 401(k) is every year you get a raise, take 1 percent and sock it away into your retirement plan. By doing so, you should have 20 percent of your pay devoted to retirement, and if the company continues to match your 401(k), this could result in a future lucrative nest egg.\nImplementing this strategy can also help with maximizing your tax break. Usually, 401(k) plans allow you to divert paying income tax on retirement savings since investors can contribute up to $17,000, as of 2012. After age 50, it jumps up to $22,000. For couples, it can reach as high as $57,500 and saving in a 401(k) plan can claim the saver\u2019s tax credit, which can net savings of $1,000 for single people and $2,000 for couples.\nAlso, you may be tempted to cash out your 401(k) funds if you quit a job, but doing so before the age of 59 and 6 months amounts to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty and income tax on the withdrawn amount. Withdrawing early can also cause you to lose out on compound interest, crucial for securing that 401(k) nest egg.\nJust remember to ask your HR rep all the right questions about your 401(k). Utilizing this important strategy will ensure you get the maximum employer\u2019s 401(k) match."}

However, they are known to separate in heat and collapse in the early stages of a fire.\nTruss construction has been implicated in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.\nThe law requires all commercial and industrial buildings that utilize truss construction to be marked with a sign or symbol to warn firefighters and rescue workers.\n\u201cIn order to provide the necessary protection from the potential collapse of truss-constructed buildings, I believe it is necessary to identify such buildings in order to forwarn firefighters and rescue workers to be best prepared when entering such a burning structure,\u201d Fuschillo said.\nIn the waning days of 2001, the Suffolk County Legislature and County Executive Robert Gaffney approved a resolution to issue $5 million in county serial bonds to cover the purchase and development of property for affordable housing projects.\n\u201cThe lack of affordable housing is hampering the creation and retention of jobs in Suffolk County, and could limit economic growth and expansion,\u201d Presiding Officer Paul Tonna said.\nTonna was re-elected to the post last week by his fellow legislators.\nThe legislation also provides for the planning steps for the county to acquire the 18-acre site in Melville called Millennium Hills.\nThe proposed development will include 84 units of housing, of which 44 units will be sold to owner-occupants under an affordable home-ownership plan.\nEach year, the mayors of Nassau County\u2019s 64 incorporated villages call on the county for a greater share of sales tax revenue.\nThis year, the county is in a bad position to ante up any more funds, but that isn\u2019t stopping Hempstead Mayor James Garner from putting on the pressure.\nIn a Jan. 2 letter to newly installed County Executive Thomas Suozzi, Garner pointed out that Suozzi\u2019s native city of Glen Cove has a population of 26,622, far less than half of Hempstead\u2019s nearly 70,000 residents.\nHowever, since Glen Cove is a city, it will receive over $900,000 in county sales tax revenue, while the village of Hempstead will get only about $3"}

But now that the American troop reinforcement plan and a new counterinsurgency strategy have helped reverse a rising tide of car bombings and sectarian killings, there are signs that Iraqis are starting to return.\nPrime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has hailed the development as an indication that security is beginning to improve. As if to underscore Mr. Maliki\u2019s point, 375 Iraqi refugees arrived Thursday in a convoy of buses from Damascus, Syria, escorted by heavily armed policemen. After the lengthy journey, the tired Iraqis were ushered into the white marble affluence of the Mansour Melia Hotel in Baghdad to receive a promised government payout to people returning to the capital.\nMany neighborhoods in Baghdad have become largely Shiite or Sunni, as one group drove the other out in calculated sectarian cleansing. Sunnis have moved into Shiite homes, and Shiites into Sunni ones. This segregation has contributed to the decline in violence. But what would happen if the original residents insisted on moving back into their homes?\nAhmad Chalabi, a Shiite politician and former Iraqi exile who made common cause with the Americans against Saddam Hussein, has been charged with developing a plan to provide services.\nAmerican officers discussed estimates of the displaced Iraqis at a seminar here on the military\u2019s metrics of assessing violence in Iraq held at Camp Victory.\nRecent American military data indicates that for the fourth week in a row, the nationwide weekly number of attacks is at its lowest level since January 2006. The number of civilians killed, as measured by the American and Iraqi governments, continued to decline in November. The number of weekly casualties, wounded as well as killed, suffered by Iraqi civilians, Iraqi forces and American forces, increased last week by 56 percent but was still below the level for most of 2006 and 2007.\nThe military also lowered"}

Online, she meets her father again \u2014 or at least, the many constructs of him he's left behind via a website he's devoted to his writing, and in the fan fiction people have written about a fictional murderer named after him in a series of mystery novels. Karen Joy Fowler's unsettling, wistful new novel Wit's End offers us a present-day world that is science fictional in the same way William Gibson's recent present-day novels are: Her characters' lives are so deeply bound up with technology that it's hard to tell where human connection ends and internet connectivity begins. The author of brilliant scifi novel Sarah Canary, and more recently of non-scifi bestseller The Jane Austen Book Club, Fowler is back in fine form with Wit's End.\nRima, our main character, begins the novel as the last surviving member of her family at the age of 29. Her mother and brother died before her father did, and she still hasn't quite gotten over their losses either. Grief-addled, she decides to stay for a while with her godmother Addison Early, a famous mystery writer who named a murderer after Rima's father Bim in one of her novels. A fan of Addison's writing, Mira decides to figure out what actually happened between her father and the novelist to inspire her strange fictional homage to him.\nIn the process, she plunges into an edit war on Wikipedia, discovers distorted descriptions of herself on LiveJournal because Addison's fans are obsessed with everything related to the author, and learns that there are whole communities devoted to writing slash fiction about Bim-the-murderer and Addison's detective character Maxwell Lane. Her relationships to the the electronic ghosts of her father, her godmother, and herself are in some ways more compelling than her real-life relationships with them. It's as if Rima is already living partly in cyberspace, forging alliances with constructed identities that take on lives of their own.\nAs she puts together the puzzle of her father's past, Rima discovers that a mystery of the fictional Maxwell's childhood is tied to a mystery in her father's past \u2014 a mystery involving a white supremacist commune near Santa Cruz called Holy City, led by a guy named William Riker. Making all of this weirder is the fact that Holy City was a real place (Fowler actually quotes at length from the actual Wikipedia entry about it, though she adds a fictional edit war to it). And yes, the commune was actually run by a guy who happens to share a name with a famous character from Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nOf course, the Star Trek franchise shows up in the plot too. And Rima has to go boldly to various places she's never gone to finally make peace with her family \u2014 both its fictional incarnations and the parts of it that remain in real life.\nFowler tells her story of fragmented, multiple identities in a charming, clear voice that never takes itself too seriously. As a result the novel manages to be cyber-surreal while also coming across as rather homey and sweet. I suppose that's what you get from a Jane Austen fan who is addicted to the internet.\nWhile there are no aliens here, or artificial intelligences who come to life, Wit's End manages to skirt the edges of"}

{"idx": "19754", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: While the 2000 presidential candidates, educators, and others haggle over student and teacher tests, I'm suggesting perhaps the most vital test of all to improve America's schools: a national standardized test for parents and community members.\nWhy not? Consider just how important parents and community members are in educating America's children. If anyone should be tested, why not those who ultimately are responsible for our children?\nOf course, this idea is pure nonsense, but it would get people's attention, because there is something fundamentally bothering many Americans.\nI hear it all across America - from people in small towns on the Great Plains, to the nation's sprawling suburbs, throughout the Mississippi Delta, and in urban areas. No amount of metal detectors and hallway patrols can address what parents and the community must do themselves.\nIn a research report my organization did, entitled \"Halfway Out the Door: Citizens Talk About Their Mandate for Public Schools,\" many Americans said they desperately want their children to get a public school education, but feel schools are failing them. Given the choice, and the money, many said they'd consider alternatives.\nThere is more than enough blame to go around on why so many Americans believe schools need improving. But while we play the blame game, and argue over legislative fixes, maybe there is something parents and community members can do to act on their aspirations for good public schools.\nThe start of the school year offers a good time to think about the kinds of standards for parents and community members that would help improve our schools.\nHere are four fundamental \"test\" questions to consider based on listening to Americans talk about schools.\n1. Do you seek to act as part of a community, or just as an individual?\nTo strengthen our public schools we must act as a community in educational decisions. It is not enough simply to lodge a complaint, answer a survey, or show up at a PTA meeting and voice your individual concerns. Education is a common community enterprise; we must find our common interests and purpose for our schools. Everyone acting as an individual only will create more gridlock, frustration, and schools that seem beyond our control.\n2. When you talk about education, whom do you talk about?\nToo often, Americans tell me, people focus nearly obsessively on their own child - at PTA meetings, when speaking with an educator, or across the fence with a neighbor. All this endless talk eventually crowds out conversations about our children and what is important for our school. Yes, put your kid first; but it is only when we are willing to take part in conversations not just about \"my kid,\" but \"our children,\" that we can even see the larger issues we must confront.\n3. How do you put your child first?\nWe all love our children and hope for their best, but just how engaged are you really, for instance, in their homework? Do you often hope that they'll finish up quickly so you can do something else, like watch TV? What kinds of questions do you ask that make your child really think, rather than the old stand-in, \"Kid, how was school today?\" Many Americans have told me that too often we give lip service to supporting our kids' education and don't come through for them.\n4. How are you acting as an educator?\nThere is no school that can ensure that magazines are in a home for young children to flip through even before they can read; that can help a child learn to look both ways before chasing a loose ball in the street; that can wrap their arm around a lonely child who sorely lacks adult attention and affection. These things are critical to raising our children and to their education, for we all know that education occurs not just"}

Seeing as I don\u2019t have a part-time job as a drag artist, I can\u2019t vouch for the discomfort that wearing them entails, but I do know that I have seen many women in my surgery over many years suffering from the consequences of their high heels habit, sometimes permanently.\nTo understand why high heels might not be all they\u2019re made out to be you have to look at our anatomy. When you squeeze your feet into a favourite pair of Louboutin heels, your foot slides forward as your toes are forced into the unnatural shoe shape. This causes body weight to be distributed incorrectly and so tilts the body forward. We compensate for this effect by leaning backwards slightly and overarching the spine, creating a posture that puts strain on the knees, lower back and hips. In addition, calf muscles may shorten, and tendons thicken with long-term wearing of high heels. These effects have been shown to occur in studies using electrical testing of muscles, finding that the low back, knee, hip, calf and foot muscles all have to work harder when wearing a high-heeled shoe than a flat one.\n\u2014 When possible, wear sensible heels, such as shoes with a heel that measures an inch and a half or less, with a wide heel base (a slightly wider heel spreads the load more evenly) and try to avoid heels more than three inches high since these can cause shortening of the Achilles tendon.\n\u2014 If you can, try to wear soft impact-absorbing insoles to cushion any impact on your knees.\n\u2014 Make sure your shoe size is correct \u2014 wear shoes that allow you to wiggle your toes \u2014 and, when buying shoes, buy them in the afternoon when your feet are at their largest.\n\u2014 Alternate your choice of shoes from one day to the next.\n\u2014 Remember to stretch your leg muscles before and after putting high heels on. I always suggest stretching twice daily anyway, by standing on the edge of a step with your shoes off. With your weight on the balls of your feet and your heels hanging over the edge, drop your heels down and gently stretch the heel tendon up and down. You can also try to pick up a pencil from the floor with your naked feet as this helps to work and stretch the foot tendons.\nJust to add insult to injury as well, those flat shoes you\u2019re now eyeing up warily are not always as safe as they can appear. Many of them have a pointed toe box at their front, causing toes to be squashed into them and forcing the big toe outwards. This can trigger the formation of bunions and it\u2019s no surprise to me that about 90 per cent of the operations undertaken to correct this problem are carried out on women, and that bunions are rare in populations that do not wear shoes.\nLeonardo da Vinci wrote that the human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art. In that respect he was right, although I doubt he ever wore a pair of bright red six-inch heels in his studio. However, a little bit of common sense with your footwear still allows for happy feet and high(ish) fashion to live happily together.\nDoes heading a football cause brain damage?\nA bad flu season is overdue.

Suggestions?\nA few years ago, ESG (and other) research indicated that security concerns posed the biggest impediment for more pervasive use of cloud computing. What happened next? Business executives and CIOs found that cloud agility, flexibility and potential cost savings were too good to pass up, creating a \u201ccloud or bust\u201d mentality. Naturally, CISOs had to do their best and go along for the ride whether they were ready or not.\nTaken together, there are still wide cloud security gaps associated with people, processes and technologies.\n1. Get training. Many of the deficits described above are a consequence of on-the-job cloud security training. Yes, cybersecurity professionals will pick things up, but by the time security pros figure things out, cloud security will lag way behind where it should be. Since cloud computing demands a new attitude and skill set, it\u2019s worthwhile to invest in appropriate hands-on security education up front. Ambitious members of the cybersecurity staff will recognize the career opportunity and pursue cloud security training with gusto.\n2. Use cloud security as an organizational change agent. CISOs have long lamented about their desire to drive information security closer to the business. Well, cloud computing provides a perfect opportunity to force this change. Cloud security polices, controls and even application security can be far more effective if they are integrated into early stages of business planning and application development lifecycles. ESG has found this to be true in practice\u2014cloud computing leaders tend to have security baked into disciplines like DevOps and data center operations rather than bolting on security controls once cloud-based workloads are already deployed.\n3. Consider cloud security as a tabula rasa. ESG has noted that organizations tend to struggle when they try to force fit traditional security controls into cloud computing. Often, they end up wasting time, scrapping these efforts, replacing traditional controls with cloud-centric controls and then struggle to catch up with cloud proliferation. Yes, it\u2019s worthwhile to try to emulate existing best practices with cloud security, but smart CISOs will approach this with an open mind and look for the best security controls that gracefully support the nuances of cloud security out of the box.\n4. Look for help. While the cloud is still new and scary to a lot of cybersecurity professionals, cloud popularity has produced a growing population of cloud security specialists. CISOs should do a lot of background checks on their vendors by grilling management, field engineering and reference accounts.

Chances are good that you don a hat and sunglasses and apply sun protection like SPF 30+ lotion, cream or spray.\nUnfortunately, sun damage can also creep in when you\u2019re least expecting it. That\u2019s one reason dermatologists recommend wearing sun protection every day, no matter what\u2019s on your agenda.\nSunburns increase the risk of developing skin cancer, but the reality is, even people who never burn are at risk of sun damage. Any change in the color of your skin, whether it\u2019s a tan or a burn, indicates sun damage.\nEven if you slather on sunscreen every few hours, you may still be getting unanticipated sun exposure or making your skin more sensitive to the sun than it needs to be.\nWatch the windows. Sunlight is made up of two kinds of ultraviolet rays: UVA and UVB. Unfortunately, glass only blocks UVB rays. UVA rays can penetrate a window and damage your skin. That\u2019s one reason doctors often see more sun damage \u2013 and skin cancer \u2013 on the left side of people\u2019s faces compared to the right. The driver\u2019s side car window offers unparalleled sun exposure. Heading on a road trip? Use sunscreen all over your face and also on your exposed left arm.\nMind your meds. Certain medications, including some antibiotics, antihistamines, birth control pills, acne medications and diabetes drugs can cause your skin to be more sensitive to the sun. The meds cause a chemical change in the skin that makes it more vulnerable to sunburns.\nBeware of essential oils. Avoid dabbing yourself with oils before heading outdoors: Certain essential oils can also cause photosensitivity. Aromatic favorites such as bergamot, wild orange, lemon and lavender may trigger sun sensitivity. Even something as innocent as lime juice can become toxic in the sunshine. A chemical reaction takes place between the oil and sunlight, resulting in blistering and redness that may leave behind areas of darkness.\nCheck your skin care products. Most people know that skin care products containing retinols can make skin more sun sensitive. Ingredients such as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) can also make your skin more vulnerable.\nPay attention to neglected areas. Areas that we often forget to protect from the sun include hands, feet, scalp, part lines in the hair, as well as open patterns in bathing suits and sandals. Every uncovered area of your skin is vulnerable. Your eyes are also vulnerable, so make sure to wear sunglasses whenever you\u2019re outdoors.\nDon\u2019t trust cloud coverage. Contrary to popular belief, as much as 80 percent of the sun\u2019s UV rays bust through clouds. That\u2019s why you can still tan and burn on cloudy, overcast days. People who have a history of skin cancer, and those who have fair skin, red hair and a lot of freckles are especially vulnerable.\nThe best way to live safely with all of these hidden dangers is to wear sun protection as part of your daily routine \u2013 just like brushing your teeth. Find a moisturizer with SPF that you like and use it all year round on your face, so at least you know you\u2019re achieving some level of sun protection daily.\nEven when you\u2019re wearing a full face of makeup, use an SPF-setting spray or refresher spray for added protection during the day.

That means oil companies will begin paying for the greenhouse gases their products emit, a cost the oil companies say they will pass on to consumers. They say it will amount to an extra 15 cents a gallon.\nGas prices already have risen by close to 50 cents a gallon since the beginning of the year, for reasons that have nothing to do with AB 32. The prospect of adding 15 cents more \u2014 though it's relatively minor compared with the overall price increase \u2014 is daunting to many drivers. Assemblyman Henry T. Perea (D-Fresno) has introduced a bill to delay the extension of the law to transportation fuels for three additional years.\nThat won't do at all. California may be ahead of the rest of the nation in the crucial effort to stave off the worst of global warming, but recent reports have made it clear that the state must intensify its efforts if it is to meet its emissions goals for the decades beyond. Emissions from the transportation sector, which in California means mostly cars and trucks, are the single largest source of greenhouse gases, according to the state Air Resources Board.\nThe state must give drivers strong incentives to take fewer trips, carpool, use public transit and purchase electric or fuel-efficient vehicles. At the same time, state officials must remain sensitive to the effect a price increase will have on low-income and working-class Californians, especially those who commute long distances in areas where robust public transportation systems have not been built.\nThe best solution to this dilemma was proposed this year by Senate leader Darrell Steinberg: Rather than extending AB 32, impose a carbon tax on gasoline, at least for a transitional period. But make it revenue-neutral by giving the money back to taxpayers \u2014 and especially low-income taxpayers \u2014 through tax credits on the state's personal income tax.\nA carbon tax that pushes up gas prices would give all California drivers reason to be gas-thrifty. They could then decide whether to use their tax credit to offset the increased cost of buying gas or find ways to reduce gas purchases and use the credit for other purchases. Substantially larger tax credits would go to lower-income residents and perhaps to rural residents for whom public transit isn't available. Some of the money could be set aside for rebates to residents who buy fuel-efficient cars, or to agricultural operations that switch to cleaner farm vehicles or methane-capture technologies.\nBritish Columbia has a similar carbon tax. Economists say it has given the province the lowest income tax rates in Canada, contributing to a robust economy while substantially reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\nUnfortunately, Steinberg backed away from that proposal in favor of a deal to use the cap-and-trade money for long-term projects to reduce carbon emissions, such as high-speed rail from Los Angeles to the Bay Area and affordable housing near public transit. Those are worthy projects, but they are not quick ways to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.\nIn any case, there's other cap-and-trade money to be used"}

And the facility\u2019s creation helped prop up downtown at a time when it and city centers across the country were struggling from the effects of suburban sprawl.\nGame Changer begins with UK Coach Adolph Rupp\u2019s retirement in 1972. The Wildcats played in Memorial Coliseum, which with 12,000 seats was much too small. Several fans who called themselves the Alley Kats began calling for a bigger arena.\nBut UK President Otis Singletary showed no interest. He was a football fan, focused on building Commonwealth Stadium to replace Stoll Field. Frustrated by UK\u2019s indifference \u2014 shades of things to come \u2014 the Alley Kats looked downtown. Business and civic leaders jumped on the idea, which they saw as a vehicle for urban renaissance, and a public-private partnership was formed.\nTheir ambitious goal was to build the nation\u2019s biggest (23,500 seats) and best college basketball arena, a state-of-the-art facility that also could host other events. As part of the complex, they proposed downtown\u2019s first modern hotel and a convention center, which city leaders had wanted for decades. And if shopping malls could work in the suburbs, why not downtown?\nThe project grew to include renovation of the 1886 Opera House, but that became a reconstruction when the roof collapsed. Then, as now, the Opera House was controversial because it was too big for some shows and too small for others. But downtown Lexington would be a poorer place today without it, and this group was far-sighted enough to create an endowment fund to help support its operation.\nThe public-private partnership was risky and challenging, and people interviewed for the film tell some entertaining stories about how it all came together. In the end, everything worked, thanks to civic leaders such as Jim Host, Foster Pettit, Dewitt Hisle, Tom Dupree, Jake Graves, Linda Carey and many others.\nRupp Arena turned out to be a great basketball and concert venue. Good management and functional design have also allowed Rupp to successfully host everything from ice hockey to tractor pulls. The convention center, Hyatt Regency hotel and Opera House continue to play major roles in this city.\nThe Lexington Center says 1.2 million people attended events there this year, generating $19.8 million in revenue and creating an economic impact estimated at $80 million.\nGame Changer covers some controversial aspects of Lexington Center\u2019s creation, but no critics appear in the film. We hear only from defenders.\nThe 1970s practice of shutting the public out of the decision-making process for such a major public facility would never pass muster today. Neither would the wholesale destruction of an historic neighborhood occupied mostly by poor black people in order to create a 20-acre parking lot. And rightfully so.\nAs the Lexington Center Corp. looks for financial support for its expansion plans, it faces several challenges, some of which have been there since the beginning.\nThe original design crammed too much into too small a space. The shopping mall has always struggled. Redeveloping that sea of asphalt \u2014 and building the parking structures the complex should have always had \u2014 present both challenges and opportunities for the future.\nGame Changer tells a good story, but it\u2019s not the whole story."}

Ninety-six percent of American men are back to work within two weeks of a baby&apos;s birth.\n\"There might be some stigma attached,\" says Gordon Dahl, an economist at the University of California, San Diego. \" &apos;What if I take paternity leave, will I not get the next promotion? Or will people think I&apos;m not as connected to the workplace? Am I kind of signaling that I don&apos;t care about work enough?&apos; \"\nDahl studied leave policies in Norway, where a generation ago men took long paternity leave at the same rate as American men. Then, in 1993, Norway changed the law. After every birth, working parents still got 8 months of paid leave to split among themselves but 4 weeks were added just for dad.\n\"Overnight, paternity leave take up went from about 3 percent to 35 percent of fathers,\" Dahl says.\nIt was a nice boost, mostly among men working union and government jobs.\nWhat puzzled Dahl was the change that he saw over the next two decades. \"This is where the story gets more interesting, because over time, it gradually crept up to about 70 percent of fathers taking leave,\" Dahl says.\nHe found the secret was seeing a dad come back to his job, especially in the private sector, without any problems.\n\"If you had a coworker take leave, then you&apos;re 11 percentage points more likely to take leave yourself when you have your child. If you have a brother who took leave, you&apos;re 15 percentage points more likely to take leave,\" Dahl says. \"These are not small effects. These are big increases in how many people are willing to take leave.\"\nSomething similar may be brewing in California, where paid leave has been available to working parents since 2004. Consider Facebook. A combination of factors is tipping the culture toward men actually taking their paternity leave.\nTom Stocky, a vice president, had a daughter in 2012 and took the full four months that Facebook offers new parents. \"Most of my friends were really surprised and had a lot of questions about what happened when you were away, and what did the rest of your team do, and things like that,\" Stocky says.\nThree years later, Stocky believes the leave he took is having a big impact. The men he manages are much more likely to inquire about and take a long leave.\n\"I probably meet with a new dad every month or two. And it seems like there&apos;s kind of a peer group now that is encouraging and supporting each other and more people are taking it now as a result,\" Stocky says.\nAmong them is Tom Whitnah, an engineering manager at Facebook. \"I saw Tom Stocky taking his leave right as I joined the Search Team, and it just was really clear that it was something that he thought was really important,\" Whitnah says.\nWhitnah&apos;s two kids arrived 17 months apart, and he took full leave with each one.\n\"I had just become a new manager, and I felt like I wasn&apos;t sure how a team goes without their manager for one or for three months, and he made it really clear this is something that we accommodate.

The dwindling number of properties for sale is causing prices to rise faster than wages, hurting affordability. Just 1.92 million existing homes were listed for sale in July, a 9 percent decline over the past 12 months.\nDemand among would-be homebuyers has remained relatively strong despite the shortage.\nThe 4.3 percent unemployment rate and an economic expansion now in its ninth year have drawn more buyers into the market. These buyers are also benefiting from relatively low 30-year mortgage rates that are averaging 3.82 percent this week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.\nBut rising home values means that more buyers are straining their budgets. The median sales price has climbed 6.2 percent to $258,300, more than double the pace of growth in average hourly earnings.\nThe number of signed contracts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South in July.

This is particularly so as Malaysia's nine royal rulers had jointly urged the government last month to quickly conclude the investigations, he was quoted as saying.\nThe interview was the first time that the new attorney-general, who controversially took over from Tan Sri Gani Patail in the midst of probes into Mr Najib's accounts and 1MDB, had given a deadline for the investigations to be concluded.\nIn August, MACC confirmed the existence of funds in Mr Najib's accounts but said they were donations from the Middle East.\nThe agency also made known then that it would summon Mr Najib to explain the donations but did not set a date for their meeting.\nThe funds discovered in the bank accounts of the Premier and the struggles of 1MDB to repay debts of RM42 billion have sparked calls for Mr Najib's resignation, led by former premier Mahathir Mohamad.

Here, Gary Tuchman talks about covering people praying on what they call America's \"holy highway.\"\nDALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, \"A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness.\"\nChurchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35.\nNow, is it possible that this \"highway\" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case.\nIt was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called \"Light the Highway.\"\nChurchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing.\nSome of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the \"holy\" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas.\nThey chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would \"see the light\" and perhaps close down.\nThe woman who came up with the concept of \"Light the Highway\" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs.\nSee why some people say the Bible inspired them to pray on the side of a highway on AC 360.\nShe says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after \"once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35.\"\nJacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds.\nNow, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35.\nAt an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others.

It ain\u2019t easy out there (or in here).\nThis is hardly an unknown phenomenon \u2013 I believe broadcast TV was first pronounced dead during the time of Aristotle \u2013 but you do feel an ever-heightened sense of urgency from marketers, agencies, and content creators and distributors of all flavors.

Here\u2019s one man\u2019s take of a few key insights both live and in color.\nNo more Chief Marketing Officers?\nEven as the average tenure of Chief Marketing Officers has declined in recent years, their status as the \u201ccelebrity chefs\u201d of the advertising world has only intensified. Few jobs have been more challenging in recent years as CMOs must grapple with the mind-boggling complexity of the media marketplace, the massive disruptions of consumer behavior in physical and retail commercial environments, and an ever more harrowing relationship with long-trusted agency partners. As Dana Treseder, CMO of GE Ventures stated at Ad Week, \u201cthere is still a place for the artist,\u201d but a CMO is far more than a \u201cmarketer\u201d these days.\nThe CMO\u2019s job today is less about being a \u201ccreative\u201d in the old-fashioned advertising sense than the exercise of extraordinary creativity in developing the right marketing technology stack, assembling the right mix of 1st party and external data, producing executable responses to those data insights, and constructing a far better understanding for your entire company of who your consumer is, how they behave, and how to best connect with them. The CMOs I heard speak including Ty Shay of Norton LifeLock and Aditi Gokhale of Northwestern Mutual (as well as Treseder) ruminated that in the future a more accurate title for their job might be Chief Customer Officer, Chief Data Analyst, or even Chief Understanding Officer (OK, a little out there, but you get the idea).\nOf course, the proliferation of content is providing not just massive opportunity (\u201cso exciting to be in the business right now\u201d) but accelerating challenges for media companies and for marketers. The FX network calculated that a record 487 scripted TV series aired in 2017, which is great for producers in the short term, but as Shapiro pointed out, since Netflix launched House of Cards, the viewing of the average hour of TV programming has declined by 30-40% while costs have increased dramatically (lots more buyers in the market). Sorry, everybody, but that is not sustainable economics.\nThe challenge of distributing content has grown for both content producers and distributors, not to mention for advertisers and agencies. As Jonathan Skogmo, CEO of digital native Jukin Media pointed, out, unless you have a significant proprietary distribution platform, you not only lack the audience scale that advertisers demand but the first party data that enhances your value to those advertisers. And distribution is a hard-fought battle for not just for entertainment content, but for advertising"}

One reason for this is that an adult redear can provide good table fare. Another reason for its popularity is that any size of redear is a legal catch. Since redear sunfish are classified as nongame fish in Missouri, there is no minimum length limit for the species. The daily limit for nongame fish is 50.\nSpecies status: Originally, redear sunfish were only found in the southern third of Missouri, but, because of intentional stocking and accidental introduction, the fish can now be found at many sites throughout the state.\nFirst discovered: The first scientific description of the redear sunfish was written by the zoologist Albert Carl Gunther in the 19th century.\nFamily matters: Redear sunfish belong to the family Centrarchidae, a group more commonly known as the sunfish. This group includes popular species like largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and crappie.\nLength: Occasionally redear sunfish will exceed 10 inches, but most are nine inches are less.\nWeight: Some redear sunfish may exceed a pound, but usually they\u2019re one pound or less in weight.\nDistinguishing characteristics: Redear sunfish have a flattened, slab-sided body that resembles its close cousin \u2014 the bluegill. The back and sides are golden or light olive-green; the belly is yellow or orange-yellow. The sides are often marked by a series of blackish vertical bars. Adults have a black ear flap with a whitish border and a prominent orange or red spot. These colors are most prominent in adult males.\nLife span: Studies have shown redear sunfish can live up to nine years.\nHabitat: Although redear sunfish can be found in a variety of habitats, they do their best in warm, clear waters with no noticeable current and an abundance of aquatic plants.\nLife cycle: Redear sunfish nest in May or June in Missouri. A second nesting has been observed in some farm ponds in the state in August. The nests are saucer-shaped depressions, fanned out in silt if no gravel is present. Redear sunfish tend to nest in colonies with the rims of the nests almost touching in some cases. Females can deposit up to 45,000 eggs, which are guarded and aerated by the male until they hatch."}

Christmas special tonight, it\u2019s a safe bet that you\u2019re either reading this as a big fan or a confused bystander wondering when and why the hell this low-key Canadian show became so beloved.\nTo be a \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan who watched it from the start (or at least since it dropped on Netflix) means defending it to skeptical naysayers with emphatic joy. \u201cThe title is the name of a town, it\u2019s supposed to be a joke!\u201d you\u2019ll exclaim to their raised eyebrows. \u201cIt takes some time to get going, but once it does, it\u2019s the best,\u201d you\u2019ll insist to their initial wariness. And if all of the above doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s nothing quite like whipping out a trusty, \u201cbut Eugene Levy and Catherine O\u2019Hara\u201d caveat to prove the show\u2019s inherent bonafides.\nAll of the above is true. The series about a rich family going bankrupt began as a fun project for O\u2019Hara, Levy, and his son Dan (also \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u2019s\u201d co-creator and showrunner) to play the kinds of narcissistic weirdos that have long defined their comedy. It was always sharp, and everyone\u2019s arch performances made characters that could have been too irritating to withstand too hilarious to ignore. (Though admittedly, Chris Elliott\u2019s slovenly mayor was perpetually out of step from everyone else.) But it was also always clear if the series was going to have a meaningful life past its premise, \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d would have to shift from its initial \u201csnobs vs rubes\u201d setup to become something more.\nAnd lo, it did. As us annoying diehards will tell you annoying reluctants until we turn blue in the face, \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d has since revealed itself to be a bright spot of comedy as smart as it is warm. The Rose family slowly but surely let go of their former lavish life and tried to move forward in their humble new one, albeit with a wall dedicated to the many ostentatious wigs of their theatrical matriarch Moira (O\u2019Hara, turning in a performance as bonkers as it is brilliant, as per always).\nBut while the partnership of O\u2019Hara and Levy \u2014 playing a married couple once again \u2014 is a reliable goldmine, the impressive evolution of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d is in large part thanks to the Rose\u2019s children and the actors who play them. David (Dan Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy) began the series as insufferable party monsters (though ones with impeccable comedic timing). Four seasons later, they\u2019re still partial to the finer things in life, but they\u2019re also functional-ish adults capable of compassion beyond their most immediate needs. Alexis leaned into her ambitious side, had her heart broken, stitched it back together. David made his first best friend (played by a perfectly deadpan Emily Hampshire), started a business, and fell in love. They didn\u2019t become different people, but they did become better ones, and watching them do it was a wonderful, unexpected pleasure.\nSo, no, maybe David being openly pansexual in Schitt\u2019s Creek isn\u2019t \u201crealistic.\u201d But bypassing homophobia altogether makes it possible for Levy to prioritize David\u2019s queerness and relationship without centering the reactions of straight people around him (an annoying, persistent trope in stories that are ostensibly about LGBTQ people).

The video has garnered more than 2.5 million views and is the second-most-viewed TED talk of all time.\nSimon Sinek, an ex-advertising executive and author, is perhaps best known for his concept of the Golden Circle. The concept revolves around the thought leadership and messaging approach utilized by some of the world's most exciting leaders and brands \u2014 the Wright Brothers, Apple, and Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 which, as Sinek puts it, \"starts with the why.\"\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the \"what\" they do aspect and eventually work their way back to talk about \"how\" and \"why\" they do what they do.\nHowever, companies that are universally identified as unique and successful communicate with an \"inside-out\" type of thinking, observes Sinek. They start with the why and only then do they move on to talk about the how and what portions of what they do.\nSo, why does the order in which we communicate matter? It has to do with the parts of our brain that are engaged when we communicate different types of information.\nWhen we're talking about what we do, we're speaking to a rational and analytical part of the brain that's tied to language. But when we talk about the why and how, we're communicating with feelings and dealing with human behavior - gut decisions - that have no capacity for language.\nThink about Apple under the leadership of Steve Jobs. Apple is really just a computer company, but people have never seen Apple as \"just a computer company.\" In fact, Apple and Dell sell pretty similar products, but it's safe to say that the two companies are held in much different esteems in the public eye. We happily buy more TVs, music players, and all sorts of other devices from Apple because we're inspired by the story they tell.\nDell starts with the \"WHAT\"\nWhen you land on the Dell website it says, \"Welcome to Dell!\" From there, you choose from the \"For Home\" or \"At Work\" sections that tout \"products designed specifically for home use\" or \"business and public sector products, services, and solutions.\"\nApple starts with the \"WHY\"\n\"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. We challenge the status quo by making beautifully designed products that are simple to use.\"\nNow which company do you want to buy from? With Dell, you're being sold a computer - end of story. But with Apple, simply by reversing the expected order of communication, the company is able to inspire us - to tap into a more emotional part of our brain where we make decisions based on feelings. And let's be honest, Apple just feels better than Dell.\nThis Golden Circle approach to messaging can be applied to content marketing and marketing automation plans as well. Marketing automation tools rely on workflows - populated with emails, triggers, and various types of content - created for the purpose of moving consumers through a natural buying process.\nThese workflows are designed by marketers who, in theory, have taken the time to understand buyer personas and pair appropriate content to the different stages in the buying cycle.\nThe next time you're planning content - email copy, e-book titles, calls to action, blog posts, etc. - anything for a marketing automation flow, take time to think through the way you're choosing to tell your story.\nConnect with your customers first by expressing the why"}

The bank hopes the service can help the company achieve its audacious goal of having a billion customers worldwide by 2010. Citicorp, the bank's parent, which intends to merge with Travelers Group into a new company called Citigroup, will be starting out with 100 million customers in the United States and abroad.\nTo customers, the new service will look like a jazzed-up replacement for Direct Access, Citibank's on-line banking system. Direct Access moved onto the World Wide Web in 1997 after years as a modem-based system that required customers to use special Citibank software.\nBut for Citibank, the changes will be far more fundamental as it replaces the core back-office computer systems on which it keeps customer accounts -- systems that it has built and maintained at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank is taking such radical action to catch up with a new generation of competitors like E-Trade and more nimble, established companies like Charles Schwab and Banc One's First USA credit card unit, which seized the initiative on Internet financial services.\n''Among bankers, Citibank is at the front of the pack,'' said Bill Burnham, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''The problem is there are a heck of a lot of new people in the race, and most of them are in front of the bankers.'' Mr. Burnham estimates there are three million Internet-based brokerage accounts in the nation and far fewer on-line banking accounts.\nHe said that Citibank's plan to discard its existing systems might be the best way to catch up with the leaders.\nOther analysts, though, question whether such an elaborate effort will succeed in promoting banking services, the perceived customer benefits of which may be far less compelling than stock brokerage services.\nThe new Citibank service, designed by a team known internally as E-Citi, is the brainchild of Edward Horowitz, the outspoken former cable television executive hired by John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, in January 1997 to oversee advanced technology. Mr. Horowitz will have similar responsibilities for Citigroup after the merger.\nWhen he took the job, Mr. Horowitz thought he could build new services upon the existing computer systems of Citibank. After all, it had been one of the first banks to introduce computer banking in 1985. But he found the going painfully slow, held back by organizational inertia and lumbering ''legacy'' mainframe computer systems.\n''Changing a legacy system is like changing a tire on a car that is moving 60 miles an hour,'' Mr. Horowitz said last week.\nThe nightmare would be a financial company that uses computers far more nimble than the patchwork of aging mainframes that Citibank and all the other big banks have assembled over the years, in which every type of account is kept in a separate system -- one for checking accounts, another for mortgages and so on.\nTo do this, Mr. Horowitz decided to build what amounts to a new on-line bank mainly out of software bought from companies like Security First Technologies, which created the first bank to operate only on the Internet.

Chait entirely avoids any consideration of the possibiltiy that his hatred is symptomatic of underlying liberal sickness by attempting to make the case that the hatred is unique to President Bush.\nOnly this past Sunday, Edmund Morris published a review of the new volume of Reagan letters in the Washington Post that seethed with the kind of hatred Chait articulates so perfectly in his New Republic piece. It is the kind of hatred that manifests itself as the symptom of a deep mental disturbance: the hatred of sickness for health and of misery for happiness.\nWitness the liberals\u2019 hatred of the Boy Scouts over their refusal to bow before the dogma that homosexuality is the equal of heterosexuality, over their unapologetic patriotism and masculinity \u2014 in Chait\u2019s terms, over their very Bush-ness. This hatred manifests itself in the liberals\u2019 profoundly illiberal desire not simply to shun or stigmatize the Scouts, but rather to defund and destroy the organization.\nReader Dafydd ab Hugh expands on the underlying phenomenon in his own inimitable way: \u201cExtreme hatred is what we in mathematics call a self-organizing and replicating system. If you dump a bunch of cubes into a box, they will fall all higgledy-piggledy. But if you begin gently shaking the box, after a while, all the cubes will be oriented more or less the same direction, fitting snugly together. This is a self-organizing system; in the case of Bush hatred, when people around the typical liberal all profess hatred for Bush and keep prodding the new guy for how he feels, he will begin falling in line with the culture around him. This is called acculturation: the new guy feels cognitive dissonance until he begins to voice hatred towards Bush. After a while of saying it, at first just because it\u2019s expected, he begins to believe it metaprogramming).\n\u201cIntensification sets in because there is a feedback loop where the more extreme the expression of hatred, the more applause and approval the speaker receives. The system is self-replicating because there are a number of interests \u2014 often in the strictest definition of the word, as in financial interests \u2014 driving those within the cult of hatred to recruit more members, both to reduce the dissonance (haters like to surround themselves with haters, so they don\u2019t feel guilty or queasy) and also because there is strength and safety in numbers.

Indian Anita Desai writes of her country, and, although not well known in America (\"Fire on the Mountain,\" a previous novel, was published in the United States), her work has received numerous awards in England, including a Booker Prize.\nThis is a novel of perfect detail, of looking at the world through a magnifying glass, of collecting enough small bits to make sense somehow of the whole. For post-partition India is so complex, so troubled, so awesome that the details (from rotting fruit in the garden to the heat so intense it quells not only movement but ambition) are the best road to understanding.\nThe story begins when Tara, in her 40s, returns from Washington with her diplomat husband to visit her family in Old Delhi.In the Das family house live older sister/history teacher Bim, and Baba, a brother who never grew up.

There is the separation of India as an imposing backdrop, and so many separations within the Das family that division is considered from norm.\nThe parents, what with bridge and business (in that order) were away more often than not. And the children begin splitting up early when brother Raja opts, out of admiration for the rich Muslim neighbors, to take his education in Urdu instead of Hindi.

A bright reddish color mixed with some light green, rhubarb grows in stalks and looks similar to celery stalks. As is the case with other brightly colored fruits and vegetables, rhubarb contains numerous nutrients, such as lycopene and anthocyanins. Vitamin K is another nutrient you obtain when you eat rhubarb.\nAccording to the USDA, 1 cup of raw diced rhubarb contains 35.7 micrograms of vitamin K. The daily value -- DV -- of vitamin K is 80 micrograms, according to the Food and Drug Administration, so this amount of rhubarb contains 44.6 percent of the DV. Daily value is the percentage of a nutrient that one serving of food contains, as compared to how much of that nutrient you need per day. Daily value amounts are based on a diet consisting of 2,000 calories daily.\nThere are three types of vitamin K: K1 and K2 are natural forms, and K3 is synthetic. Vitamin K is fat soluble, which means your body absorbs it more readily when you eat dietary fats in the same meal. When you eat rhubarb, do so along with some healthy fat, such as olive oil or coconut oil.\nVitamin K aids in blood clotting, as evidenced by the fact that the \u201cK\u201d is short for the Danish word \u201ckoagulere,\u201d which means to coagulate, or clot. Vitamin K also enhances the bones' ability to form and repair. Vitamin K2 assists the body in its efforts to keep calcium in the bones. Additionally, vitamin K benefits the liver, arteries and heart.\nYou will need 1 pound of rhubarb to yield about 2 cups of the cooked vegetable. Rhubarb\u2019s taste is on the bitter side, so mix it with sweeter-tasting ingredients, such as fruit, to balance it out. Do not eat rhubarb\u2019s leaves; they are poisonous because of their oxalic acid content. There are numerous ways of preparing and eating vitamin K-rich rhubarb. You can bake or stew it, juice it or make preserves with it.\nTo boost your vitamin K intake even more, pair other foods that are rich in vitamin K in meals with rhubarb. Some of the richest food sources of vitamin K include dark leafy greens, such as kale, collard greens, turnip greens and spinach, and fermented foods, such as natto and sauerkraut. Wakame seaweed, broccoli, parsley and Brussels sprouts are additional vitamin K sources.\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics: What Does the Percent Daily Value Mean on the Food Label?\nMayoClinic.com: Percent Daily Value: What Does It Mean?\nWilson, Judy. \"Does Rhubarb Have Vitamin K?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/rhubarb-vitamin-k-5032.html.

If U.S. college graduates strongly agree that they interacted with people from different backgrounds on a regular basis in college, the odds that they believe their college degree was worth the cost are 2.2 times higher than other graduates who do not strongly agree that they interacted with people from different backgrounds.\nThe Gallup-Purdue Index explores the perceived value of a college degree by asking respondents the extent to which they believe their degree was worth the cost. The relationship between being exposed to people from different backgrounds and believing their college degree was worth the cost exists even after controlling for personality type, student loan amounts and other collegiate experiences that Gallup has previously demonstrated correlate with the perceived value of a college degree.\nGallup evaluated data from this study as the U.S. Supreme Court prepared to review a potentially landmark case on affirmative action brought against the University of Texas at Austin by applicant Abigail Fisher. Fisher, who first took her case to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008, contends that the university's affirmative action policy resulted in her rejection by the university. While the Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court, it has returned to the Supreme Court for another review. The Supreme Court's decision will set a legal precedent that could affect students' exposure to diversity throughout their higher education experience.\nResearchers have consistently demonstrated a relationship between exposure to people from different backgrounds in educational settings and positive long-term outcomes, including increases in cultural awareness and a commitment to racial understanding. The Gallup-Purdue Index explores this phenomenon by asking college graduates the extent to which they agree or disagree that they were exposed to people from different backgrounds on a regular basis during their undergraduate experience.\nGallup asked this question of recent college graduates who obtained their degree between 2010 and 2015 because these graduates should be most likely to accurately recall their experiences with diversity. Slightly less than half (46%) of all recent college graduates strongly agree they were exposed to people from different backgrounds on a regular basis during their undergraduate experience. Public college graduates (49%) are most likely to strongly agree they interacted with people of different backgrounds while in college, followed closely by private for-profit graduates (46%) and private not-for-profit graduates (41%).\nThese results are based on the 2015 Gallup-Purdue Index survey of college graduates.

Drug trafficking is a criminal act in the Philippines and all over the world. The life of [every] Filipino is valuable, and we pray this is the last time that a tragedy like this befalls any of our countrymen,\u201d Hernandez said.\nVice-president Jejomar Binay was previously set to travel to Beijing to personally deliver Aquino\u2019s letter of appeal to Chinese president Xi Jinping.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry however sent word that it was \u201cnot a convenient time\u201d for Binay to come to China forcing him to cancel his trip.\nThe family of the Filipina had flown to China Sunday and was able to talk for 30 minutes with her Monday, Hernandez told reporters in a briefing Monday. That was the only time they were able to talk with her, he said.\nThey were also not informed of the date of execution, Hernandez said.\nThe death sentence was handed down by China Supreme People\u2019s Court last June 26 upholding the decision of a lower court.\nPhilippine Consul General in Shanghai Charles Jose had received the note verbale about the death sentence on June 27.\nIt stated that the execution would be carried out within seven days of the receipt of the note verbale. The deadline ended on July 3, Wednesday.\nThe latest execution comes amid already rocky relations between the two countries, soured by overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nAquino spokeswoman Abigail Valte also extended the government\u2019s sympathies to the woman\u2019s family.\n\u201cHowever unfortunate, we hope that this will serve as a continuing lesson to our citizens not to allow themselves to be victimized and to fall prey to these (drug) syndicates,\u201d she said in a statement.\nAbout a tenth of the Philippines\u2019 100 million people work abroad, many of them under harsh conditions.

However, on May 30 they ran into serious trouble: their motor died, leaving them dependent on sail. They continued on their course for two months before attempting to signal for help, but to no avail. Despite multiple signals to passing vessels, no one answered their call.

The fishing vessel contacted the U.S. Coast Guard station at Guam, which coordinated with authorities in Taiwan, Japan and Honolulu to arrange a rescue. USS Ashland was operating in the vicinity, and she transited to assist, arriving at 1030 hours the following morning. The Ashland\u2019s sailors brought the two women aboard, along with their two dogs. They were provided with medical assessments, food and berthing, and they will remain on board until the vessel's next port of call.\n\"I'm grateful for their service to our country.

In today\u2019s NBA, one of the important things particularly in a market like Charlotte (which can\u2019t live off free agency) is player development: getting those draft picks and developing them. We have the G-League team in Greensboro. We have to use all those resources. I can remember when I first got involved in basketball (in the late 1980s) it was a seven months (a year) business. Not to say people took off, but it wasn\u2019t as intense. Now it\u2019s an 11-month business. Maybe at some point if you\u2019re out of the playoffs, or after free agency, you have sort of a slow month, but this is 11 months of high-intensity work where you have to pay attention to what your players are doing in the offseason. Make sure they are following a training program so that they don\u2019t come into training camp out of shape or picked up any bad habits. It\u2019s really something that has become a premium: What are the players doing in the off-season? That is going to become a very important quality to our coaching hires - that they came from an environment where there was a big premium on player development, and where they\u2019re able to articulate to Mitch what sort of program they plan to put in place with us.\nQ. You\u2019ve made a lot of changes in basketball operations staff (trainers, strength-and-conditioing coaches, scouting) that go beyond replacing the general manager and coach. Why have you changed so many people in so many roles?\nA. We have to have the culture aligned from top to bottom on the basketball operations side. We asked Mitch to take a hard look at all the basketball roles. To not feel that we have any situation that we can\u2019t change if that\u2019s important to get this right.\nClifford was let go following a meeting with new general manager Mitch Kupchak, who took over Monday night. The 36-46 Hornets missed the playoffs for a second consecutive season. Here's what might happen next.\nQ. How far or close to where you feel you need to be are you, after two 36-victory seasons?\nTo be in the middle of the pack in the NBA is not a great situation to be in. Either you make the playoffs and lose in the first round or you\u2019re sort of ninth in the East or West, and not getting one of those top-4 draft picks, which is the most impactful looking at history. So, you either need to look at more of a long-term conscientious plan on how you\u2019re going to rebuild \u2013 and years ago, that\u2019s what we went through in 2011 \u2013 and it paid off. We got to 48 wins in 2016. It was very respectable.\nThe rules, with the increase of the cap (due to the sudden influx of national television money in the summer of 2016), hurt us a little bit. There was a flood of money chasing free agents and we happened to have a lot of free agents. It sort of caught us by surprise.

We condemn all terrorist violence, and let there be no doubt, we are with you 100 per cent on this issue,\" Mr Blake declared.\nTo help promote regional stability in South Asia, the US and India meet regularly to discuss \"mutual concerns\" in Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan.\n\"The US also supports continued efforts by India and Pakistan to better their relations,\" Mr Blake added. A copy of his remarks was made available by the US embassy.\n\"The relationship between our two countries transcends domestic politics, just as it did during the Clinton-Bush transition in 2001 and the BJP-Congress transition earlier this year,\" Mr Blake said, signalling a continuity of stable ties with New Delhi regardless of the party in power.\n\"Without doubt, military cooperation remains one of the most vibrant, visible, and proactive legs powering the transformation of US-India relations. This cooperation succeeds because of the Indian and US military establishments' mutual desire to move our relationship forward,\" the envoy said.\nOn the Indian side, there has been a tremendous effort to look to expand areas of mutual benefit, to look for partnerships, not antagonisms, and to look for regional collaboration, he observed. Mr Blake's list of military hardware - both sold and in the pipeline - was impressive.\nIn July 2003, two AN-TPQ/37 Firefinder counter-battery radars arrived and have been deployed in India. Two more radars, part of a 12 unit $190 million sales agreement under Washington's foreign military sales policy, will soon be deployed, having just completed their final quality testing.\nThe second major deal under negotiation is for the P-3 Orion naval reconnaissance plane. \"US officials describe it as a \"3C-plus\" meaning the version that would be sold to India would be equipped with the latest avionics, including sensors and computerized command and control and weapons systems,\" Mr Blake said.\nHe added that India also plans to buy into the deep submersible rescue vessel (DSRV) system. Meanwhile, GE-404 engines for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) have already made their way here.\nIndia will also buy $29 million worth of unique and special equipment to enhance the counter-terrorism capabilities of its special forces. They may also purchase chemical and biological protection equipment, he said.\nHe described as an area of great promise - and one that is of great strategic and commercial importance - the US-India Next Steps in Strategic Partnership initiative, or NSSP launched in January of this year.\nThis initiative will include expanded engagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues and missile defence, ways to enhance cooperation in peaceful uses of space technology, and steps to create the appropriate environment for successful high technology commerce."}

It also anticipates doctor and patient registries through the state to begin in December or January.\nJudy Pentz, executive director of the state\u2019s chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a nonprofit that advocates for the legalization of the drug, said the clinic asked for the organization\u2019s support but she was hesitant.\nHannah Byron, executive director of the commission, said it supports the dissemination of accurate information about medical cannabis in Maryland, which is a goal of Greenway Consultation. The business plans to host monthly meetings at which dispensaries, grow sites, botanical grow stores, hydroponic shops and head shops will be invited to speak and hold education demonstrations.\n\u201cIt is important for potential patients to recognize the program\u2019s regulations are not yet finalized and that only licensed physicians in good standing with the state will be authorized to certify patients for medical cannabis use once the program becomes operational,\u201d Byron said.\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul rattled off numbers for the mostly white, mostly older crowd of Maryland Republicans, explaining how blacks are arrested for marijuana offenses in Baltimore at a higher rate than whites.\nAs the crime rate falls and the number of high-profile cases in which police officers are accused of racial bias escalates, Republicans increasingly are joining what had long been a Democratic conversation: how to reduce the size of the prison population and help ex-offenders turn their lives around.\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan this year became the latest Republican state leader to back bills intended to reduce recidivism and help ex-offenders find jobs. And while Hogan also vetoed a bill that would have expanded felon voting rights, advocates say he and other Republicans have shown a willingness to rethink long-held theories about how to reduce crime.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a change in climate in criminal justice reform,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a national advocacy group that has worked to change the way Americans view crime and punishment.\nThe shift by Republicans is largely motivated by costs, Democrats say. Fiscally conservative Republicans see prison expenses as a drain on strained budgets and are starting to work with Democrats to find less costly approaches.\nThe declining crime rate, Mauer said, has made the debate \u201cless emotional and less political\u201d for lawmakers.\nIn Alabama, where prison crowding was so severe that the federal government threatened to intervene, Republican Gov. Robert Bentley approved a measure that reduces penalties for some nonviolent property and drug crimes.\nHogan signed a bill to create the Justice Reinvestment Coordinating Council"}

During her time at Beekman, the school which previously housed grades k-8, made the transition to a full-fledged high school. Beekman's sports teams started out at the junior varsity level and spent a year as an independent before the school was granted membership in the Louisiana High School Athletic Association.\nAt Sterlington, Oliphant will have the opportunity to focus solely on basketball.\n\"I have had my eye on Sterlington for awhile,\" Oliphant said. \"It's a great place to be. It's a great atmosphere, and the athletic program is highly-regarded.\"\nWith the exception of Madeline Rogers, the Lady Panthers return their entire roster from last year's 14-19 squad, which lost to Kaplan in overtime in the first round of the state playoffs.\n\"I'm not saying we are going to win district, but I will say this is the most athleticism and height I have ever had,\" Oliphant said.\nComing off of the first winning season in their brief history (16-14 in 2016-17), the Lady Tigers slipped to 11-17 last season while making the jump from Class 1A to 2A. Oliphant caught a glimpse of her future team when the Lady Tigers dropped a 39-31 decision to the Lady Panthers in the Sterlington Tournament.\nLike Beekman, Sterlington moved up in classification for the 2017-18 school year.\n\"The district is definitely going to be tougher, but we are going to compete and try to steal a game here and there,\" Oliphant said, referring to District 2-3A.\nOliphant succeeds Mike Crumpler as the Lady Panthers' coach. Crumpler guided Sterlington to a three-year mark of 54-43, highlighted by a 24-9 mark in 2016-17, the school's final season in 2A. Sterlington earned a first-round home game last season and defeated Pickering 46-42 for its first postseason win since 2012.\nDoubling as Beekman's softball coach, Oliphant directed the Lady Tigers to their first-ever State Tournament appearance in 2017.\nOliphant attended what was then Beekman School from grades 4-7 prior to transferring to Prairie View Academy. Instantly inserted into the starting lineup as an eighth-grader, she went on to become the school's all-time leading scorer (girls or boys). She was a two-time MAIS Class 2A All-State selection for the Lady Spartans.\nAlso excelling in softball, Oliphant was a two-time All-State honoree and helped the Lady Spartans to the 2009 MAIS Class 2A state championship.\nTwo months after graduating from high school, she was hired as Prairie View's assistant basketball coach by Dave Farrell, her high school coach.\nShe accepted her first head coaching position at Riverfield Academy in the fall of 2013,"}

But following the council\u2019s June 2017 decision to sell the land to allow his development to happen, volunteers, professionals and business owners from the black community grouped together to fight the plans.\nThey formed the Save Bridge Park Campaign, which was led by the Bridge Park Community Council Steering Group (BPCC). In August 2017, the BPCC made an application to the Land Registry to restrict the council from selling Bridge Park.\nBPCC made several offers to negotiate with Brent Council.\nHowever, campaigners said the council decided not to come to the negotiating table, instead using council funds to take the BPCC to the High Court.\n\"Brent Council brought the case to the high court hoping to get the August 2017 restriction thrown out so the land sale could go ahead. But last week, a judge ruled against the council and said the issue must go to a full trial.\nThe council was refused permission to appeal against the decision. Phoenix said she believes that community groups across the country could take heart and apply lessons from the BPCC\u2019s court victory.\nShe said: \u201cMarching and petitioning all has a place.

Reg. 8,977. This landmark case is necessary to preserve the power of the commander in chief to protect the nation against liberal penumbras and emanations of political correctness liberal judges imagine that they see somewhere in the U.S. Constitution.\nIt is difficult for parties in a lawsuit to directly challenge a judge who may decide their case. Freedom Watch can do in the public interest and for the American people what direct parties may be unwilling to risk doing. I call on public interest leaders and activists and concerned citizens to join in our demand for integrity and public confidence in our nation's courts.\nIn June or July 2016, Justice Ginsburg intentionally spoke to journalists, clearly knowing and intending that her pronouncements would be widely disseminated through the news media. She deliberately met with journalists for the purpose of broadcasting her comments nationwide during and concerning a presidential campaign.\nA key issue in the upcoming travel moratorium case is whether the president's statements on the campaign trail as a candidate are to be considered in determining whether Executive Order 13769 has discriminatory intent. On its face the order offers no hint of religious discrimination and does not mention any religion. So the entire case turns on whether or not Trump's statements made in campaign appearances should be reviewed and should even trump the plain wording of the executive order.\n\"He is a faker,\" she said of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, going point by point, as if presenting a legal brief. \"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.\"\nCNN's Joan Biskupic reported: \"Having met with Ginsburg on a regular basis for more than a decade and sometimes been struck by her frankness, I found her response classic.

Certainly Iran \u2014 which had suffered the carnage of an eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, and on which Saddam Hussein unleashed chemical weapons \u2014 had no affinity for him. Rather, it was based on a sober recognition of the realities of the region and the inescapable dynamics of occupation.\nNow the United States administration is \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 reaping the expected bitter fruits of its ill-conceived adventurism, taking the region and the world with it to the brink of further hostility. But rather than face these unpleasant facts, the United States administration is trying to sell an escalated version of the same failed policy. It does this by trying to make Iran its scapegoat and fabricating evidence of Iranian activities in Iraq.\nThe United States administration also appears to be trying to forge a regional coalition to counter Iranian influence. But even if it succeeds in doing so, such a coalition will prove practically futile, dangerous to the region as a whole and internally destabilizing for Iraq. By promoting such a policy, the United States is fanning the flames of sectarianism just when they most need to be quelled.\nCoalitions of convenience like the one the United States government now contemplates were a hallmark of American policy in the region in the 1980s and 1990s, and their effect then was to contribute to the creation of monsters like Saddam Hussein, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Short memories may be responsible for this ill-advised return to old habits.\nBut who can forget that Saddam Hussein used the very same scare tactic, invoking the \u201cIranian threat\u201d to extort money, loyalty and military hardware from the region and the world, only to turn them later against his suppliers? Who cannot remember that to contain the supposed \u201cShiite Crescent\u201d after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the extremism of the fundamentalist Salafi movement was nourished by the West \u2014 only to transform later into Al Qaeda and the Taliban? Why should the same policy in the same region produce any different result now?\nThere are already indications that extremists are exploiting the most emotional sectarian and ethnic divides in the region in an effort to sell possible collaboration with old and new occupiers of Arab lands to a restive, frustrated and resentful populace. Such a shortsighted campaign of hatred will compound regional problems, and it will have global implications, from the subcontinent to Europe and the United States, long after the current crisis in Iraq ends.\nWe need to remember that sectarian division and hatred in Iraq and the wider region was most recently instigated by none other than the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The shameful legacy of Mr. Zarqawi and his collaborators should have been buried with him. To that end, all of us in the region need to set aside shortsighted schemes and engage with the government of Iraq in a common effort to contain sectarian violence.\nThe Persian Gulf region is in dire need of a truly inclusive arrangement for security and cooperation. Only through such regional cooperation, with the necessary international support, can we contain the current crisis and prevent future ones.

The latest bid values Sky at $32.5 billion, besting Comcast's offer of $30.7 billion in an all-cash deal that the cable giant proposed in April.\nBut Comcast isn't going down without a fight, according to a report published by CNBC. The cable giant is reportedly putting together a counteroffer for Sky which could be announced within days.\n21st Century Fox said that Sky's independent directors have agreed to its latest offer. Fox already owns a 39 percent stake in Sky.\nComcast, for its part, is already the largest cable provider in the U.S. and owns NBCUniversal, a multinational media conglomerate that includes television networks, a motion picture company, TV production operations, and several theme parks.\n\"We have been impressed with the continued momentum of [Sky], and the ability to have a content distribution company that looks very similar to Comcast's NBC Universal,\" Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said of the proposed acquisition during the company's Q1 2018 earnings call in April.\n21st Century Fox, Fox's entertainment business unit that includes valuable content assets, as well as part-ownership of streaming content service provider Hulu, is involved in another bidding war at the same time. Disney offered to acquire 21st century Fox in December 2017, and was then bested by none other than Comcast with an all-cash offer of $65 billion. Disney in June countered with a $71.3 billion offer for most of Fox's content assets in deal that is expected to be voted on by shareholders on July 27.\nDisney in June secured approval for the proposed acquisition from the U.S. Justice Department.\nBoth bidding wars highlight the recent media merger trend that has telecom and cable providers trying to beef up their content portfolios in an effort to compete with digital and streaming content providers, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. AT&T in June closed its $85.4 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner. Recent reports have also suggested that Basking Ridge, N.J.-based competitor Verizon is also interested in a tie-up with broadcast TV network CBS."}

{"idx": "19874", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Measuring and tracking individual and team performance is an effective way of both motivating employees and celebrating successes in organizations. But there's one aspect of the performance review process (particularly in large companies) that is counter-productive, and frankly, foolish. I speak of the process of \"forced ranking\" that demands managers and supervisors fit their employees into pre-set slots on a bell curve.\nIn case you're not familiar with the concept, bell-curving has its roots in the educational system where the objective is to minimize or eliminate the influence of variation between different instructors of the same course, ensuring that the students in any given class are assessed relative to their peers. In the final assessment, because a bell curve ensures a balanced and normal distribution of academic results, it holds some logic in an educational setting. But it absolutely does not make sense in a work environment. Bell-curving basically forces a manager to say that a certain percentage of his/her employees are sub-par. Repeatedly. Every year. And regrettably, it is standard operating procedure in many large organizations.\nHere's why this is senseless and damaging. If you trust that your managers and supervisors are good leaders (and if not, why did you put them in their roles?), then you have to also have confidence that they will hire good people. Which means that there shouldn't be a necessity to have people on the lower end of the curve. In fact, ironically, bell curve performance assessments only encourage the hiring and retention of so-so (or worse) employees. And even more destructive, bell curve performance assessments are hugely demoralizing to employees. Imagine hiring brilliant people only to label them as unworthy because you are forced to place them on a bell curve.\nAs if this isn't bad enough, many organizations add insult to injury by insisting that leaders compare all their employees and put them in order of best to worst within each segment on the bell curve. If bell-curving is a bad idea, then this is even worse. Now let me be clear \u2013 I don't have a problem with assessing an individual's performance and recognizing that some employees are higher performers than others. I am certainly not a supporter of the \"everyone is a winner\" camp. But it's the process of forcing every single person into a rank order that I find objectionable. There are times when a numerical ranking is possible and even sensible, say based on revenue generated, or calls handled, or some similar metric. But for the most part, exceptional performance is not a numerical score, so when you try to force-quantify it, all you end up doing is demoralizing your people. If you assume that you hired good employees to start with, then every single one should bring unique value to the workplace. So why would you try to force a comparison if it's not appropriate? Sure, there may be rough groupings that employees naturally fall into (exceptional, very good, and good, for example), but imposing a numerical ranking when it doesn't fit the situation is pointless. Worse than pointless, this numerical ranking on a bell curve actually drives good people away. An employee that's forced into a No. 5 ranking because of minor things separating him from No. 1 will just move on to an organization that appreciates his talents more. And their gain will be your loss.\nBell-curving doesn't have a place in high-performance workplaces. And unless the employee's job has quantifiable metrics, forced numerical ranking doesn't either. It's time to get rid of both these distasteful practices.\nMerge Gupta-Sunderji (@merges"}

Facebook gathered this data via the \"Like\" button, according to the court papers. They also alleged that Facebook uses the data gleaned from health sites to sell targeted ads based on medical topics.\nAll three say they exchanged communications with health care providers about conditions that they or a family member suffered from. Smith alleged that he had melanoma, while Jane Doe 1 said she had back pain, and Jane Doe II said her husband had an intestine transplant.\nSmith and the other users claimed that Facebook violated federal and state privacy laws, including the federal wiretap act, which prohibits companies from intercepting transmissions without at least one party's consent.\nThe web users also sued the health sites for allegedly violating their own privacy policies, which promised to refrain from sharing users' personally identifiable information.\nIn May, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila in the Northern District of California dismissed all claims against Facebook and the health sites. Davila ruled that the users consented to Facebook's data-gathering efforts, because the company discloses online that it collects information from third-party sites that use Facebook services, including the \"Like\" button and Facebook log-in button. He also ruled that he lacked jurisdiction over the health site operators because they aren't based in California.\nSmith and the other users are now appealing Davila's decision to dismiss their claims against Facebook. Among other arguments, they say Davila should not have found that they consented to share information about their visits to health sites with Facebook.\n\"No reasonable person would have believed that the specific data at issue was being disclosed to, tracked, acquired and sold by Facebook,\" they argue.\nThey add that any disclosures by Facebook about data collection conflicted with the promises made by the health sites themselves. \"No reasonable user who viewed Facebook\u2019s and the health care entities\u2019 disclosures would have understood that Facebook was collecting the information at issue,\" they write.\nFacebook is expected to file a response next month.\n1 comment about \"Facebook Users Seek To Revive Battle Over Tracking On Health Sites \".\nPenelope Wolfe from Penny Wolfe Creative Services, September 23, 2017 at 12:46 a.m.\nAutomated data manipulation has a down side."}

His concern has only deepened after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen not only pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations that he says he was ordered to carry out by Trump but was sentenced to three years in prison for the violations and other crimes, the sources say.\nThe White House sources spoke to NBC News for a new report on Thursday, in which three people close to Trump say he has become \u201calarmed\u201d by the realization that impeachment has now become a real possibility.\nRemoving Trump from office as a result of impeachment proceedings, however, remains unlikely, with Republicans continuing to control the Senate and most of those Republicans \u201cremaining steadfastly by his side,\u201d according to the political news site Talking Points Memo. The incoming Senate, which takes office in January, contains 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats including two independents who consistently vote with the Democrats. Removal from office through impeachment would require 67 Senate votes \u2014 in other words, every Democrat must vote to convict Trump along with 20 Republicans.\nBeyond the Cohen sentencing, Trump\u2019s growing realization that the incoming majority Democrats in the House will be willing to fight him \u2014 as Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi demonstrated on Tuesday in a heated, face-to-face showdown with Trump, Inquisitr noted \u2014 has him worried about impeachment. In the House, only a majority vote is required to impeach, which would then be followed by a trial in the Senate.\nMounting federal investigations into his close associates both by Russia investigation special counsel Robert Mueller and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have also caused Trump\u2019s \u201cfear\u201d of impeachment to intensify, the NBC News report said.\nBut according to federal prosecutors, Trump has in fact done something wrong by ordering Cohen to make the alleged illegal payments. And though the state of the economy has no relevance to impeachment, a study by The Washington Post shows that while it is strengthening, the current United States economy is far from the greatest in the history of the country.\nImpeachment proceedings are not triggered by the state of the economy, good or bad, but instead depend only on whether a president is believed to have committed crimes, or as the U.S. Constitution describes, \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Treason and bribery are also specified by the Constitution as grounds for impeachment, according to The Constitutional Rights Foundation."}

The House conservatives were able to reveal this trickery before the bill was voted on, but the House Democrats teamed up with the House moderate Republicans and the House conservative Republicans were not able to stop this bill from passing. Since it passed the House and Senate, it now goes to the Governor to be signed.\nGovernor Rick Perry MUST veto this bill!\nThis is a direct attack on the First Amendment. Non-profits, like pro-life groups and fiscal responsibility groups, are non-partisan and these groups promote their issues and support anyone who supports their issue. Because they are non-partisan and they are created to support an issue, they are not required to reveal private information about themselves in campaign finance reports. This is like how a church works. A church is a non-profit and, like other non-profits, is protected by the First Amendment and does not have to reveal financial information or pay taxes. A church can promote Christian issues and encourage people to vote in support of these Christian issues. Well, Joe Straus does not like that because Straus has received negative attention from some of these groups because he is not personally pro-life and has had other fiscal responsibility issues. So what does Straus do? Straus attacks the First Amendment and calls for a shakedown of these non-profit groups. These groups are not supporting him, so he wants to unconstitutionally target these groups. Can someone tell me how that is ANY different from the IRS targeting conservative non-profit and Tea Party groups because they stand for conservative values and go against the liberal values of President"}

After completing his course at the Theresian Academy, he took up the study of medicine in 1825, receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1833. In 1844 he began a series of free lectures on psychiatry at the University of Vienna, the next year became dean of the medical faculty, and in 1847 was made vice-director of medico-chirurgical studies. In July, 1848, he was appointed under-secretary of state in the ministry of public instruction, and in this capacity he attempted to introduce some important reforms in the system of education, but, discouraged by the difficulties which he encountered, he resigned in December of the following year. As a medico-philosophical writer, Feuchtersleben attained great popularity, especially through his book \"Zur Di\u00e4tetik der Seele\" (Vienna, 1838), which went through many editions (46th in 1896). Hardly less famous is his \"Lehrbuch der \u00e2rztlichen Seelenkunde\" (Vienna, 1845), translated into English by H. Evans Lloyd under the title of \"Principles of Medical Psychology\" (revised and edited by B. C. Babington, London, 1847). He also wrote an essay, \"Die Gewissheit und W\u00fcrde der Heilkunst\" (Vienna, 1839), a new edition of which appeared under the title \"Aerzte und Publikum\" (Vienna, 1845). As a poet Feuchtersleben is chiefly known by the well-known song, \"Es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rat\", which appeared in \"Gedichte\" (Stuttgart, 1836) and was set to music by Mendelssohn. His later poems are more philosophical and critical. His essays and other prose writings were published under the title \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Litteratur-, Kunst- und Lebenstheorie\" (Vienna, 1837-41).

{"idx": "19904", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Biopics usually occupy one of two lanes: glossy, Hollywood-friendly products or historical-leaning narratives that pay more service to the facts of reality. It looked like we were going to get the latter when Peter Morgan was first announced as the writer of what would eventually become Bohemian Rhapsody, and for a time, that was exciting. But then the project that eventually became director Bryan Singer's version of events was executed, and while there's moments of energy within, it's mostly a cotton candy telling of the life and times of Freddie Mercury and Queen.\nFarrokh Bulsara had dreams of becoming the person he felt he was always born to be, and it took him becoming Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) to get there. But even when Farrokh became Freddie, there was still something missing, something it'd take years for him to figure out. Through the woman he loved (Lucy Boynton) and the ragtag family of band mates he'd eventually join up with (Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello,) two very important things would happen: Freddie would become the man he always wanted to be, and Queen would become a legendary act in music history.\nThe positive aspects of Bohemian Rhapsody are unfortunately outweighed by the negatives. For starters, the film's approach to the story of Freddie's personal life, and Queen's formation / road to Live Aid, is lacking when it comes to two key areas of any good biopic: pacing and reverence to the source material.\nIn the area of pacing, the fault lies in the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody covers 15 years of history with great speed, but little detail. The film hits milestones such as the band's first demo, the formation of the titular track, and Freddie's falling out / reunion with the band in such a rapid pace that it doesn't really land the significance of any of those moments. We see them happen, but we don't really feel their impact too significantly before moving onto the next signpost.\nWhen Queen gets to be Queen in Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie actually finds some energy to put out into the audience. You can see it in the decision to lean on the Live Aid concert as both a framing device and closing act to the film's narrative. If this was a real-time recreation of that 20 minute set, or even a film that used that event as a lynchpin to keep revisiting throughout the film, there might have been a better economy of pacing.\nInstead, the film feels like it rushes through everything else, just to get to that point, and when it gets there, it decides to put up its feet and linger, rather than finish as quickly as it started. It also doesn't help that when it comes to Freddie's infamous personal life of excess, Bohemian Rhapsody pays lip-service to the subject of his vices.

As we saw during the recent abortion debate, Ireland is well aware of the atrocities committed by the Church in that time. They know about the harmful anti-abortion stance, the bigoted beliefs against LGBTQ rights, and the Magdalene Laundries. It\u2019s no surprise that Catholic leaders no longer have the respect they once received.\nPope Francis is no exception.\nOne of the ways Irish people plan to protest his appearance is by applying for free tickets to one of his largest scheduled events in Dublin\u2019s Phoenix Park\u2026 then not showing up. The organizers of Say Nope to the Pope want him to speak to empty seats representing people disgusted by the actions of the Catholic Church.\nYet even this is too radical for the Irish political establishment. The leaders of our two main political parties have spoken out against what they clearly deem an act of religious bigotry. Miche\u00e1l Martin of Fianna F\u00e1il called the action \u201cpetty, intolerant, and certainly the opposite of progressive\u201d. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar agreed, deeming the campaign \u201cWrong, petty, and mean-spirited\u201d, adding that it was not \u201clegitimate protest\u201d.\nThose politicians are angrier about a peaceful protest than the bigotry and cruelty espoused by the Catholic Church. That\u2019s why the gesture is so necessary. It will raise awareness of the Church\u2019s actions and steer people away from the same misguided thinking as these politicians.\nI simply don\u2019t have the scope in this article to do justice to the litany of the Catholic church\u2019s crimes in Ireland. Suffice to say: protesting about the pope\u2019s visit \u2014 with empty seats, placards, or any other peaceful means \u2014 is legitimate, warranted, progressive and necessary. It sends the message that we are sick of paying -\u2013 spiritually, emotionally, economically \u2014 for the evils perpetrated by the church; that we want religious orders out of our state schools and hospitals; that we want our politicians to act on evidence, not religious beliefs; that we deserve a secular society.\nI cannot imagine a less \u201cmean-spirited\u201d message.\nHe\u2019s right. Those who want to see the pope will have that opportunity. (There are plenty of tickets still available for the event, blunting the criticism that this protest is hurting those who actually want to attend the event.) But for people who aren\u2019t awed by the Church and who understand its contribution to the nation\u2019s most disturbing social policies in the past few decades, this protest is an excellent way to show Pope Francis what he means to them."}

Following a two-out single, freshman shortstop Savannah Jones stepped to the plate and drove a long shot to left field that escaped sophomore left fielder Kaitlyn Washington\u2019s glove as she collided with the wall.

Sophomore catcher Taylor Ellsworth delivered an RBI double that helped the Texas offense put together its finest performance of the tournament in a 4-2 win.\nFacing College of Charleston in the afternoon, senior pitcher Paige von Sprecken delivered another gem for the Longhorns, going the distance in a seven-inning shutout that featured two strikeouts and only one run.\nGoing into the seventh inning in a scoreless tie, the Longhorns got a much-needed run in the seventh when senior pinch hitter Randel Leahy ripped an RBI triple to score Washington, giving Texas the deciding run.\nFriday, however, was a much different story for Texas.

JN: As a mentor, I benefit in many ways. First, it keeps me connected to a community of people that I might not otherwise be engaged with. In order to do my job at Xerox, I need to understand customer requirements and employee perspective. Mentoring allows me to understand challenges that our employees encounter in the business, whether in my immediate work area or elsewhere. Second, mentoring gives me visibility into a broad network of individuals. Xerox's level of success is totally dependent upon the quality of its employees. Senior managers have a responsibility to develop employees to become future leaders of this company, and mentoring is an avenue to do that. Last, I enjoy mentoring. It's very rewarding to feel that you've helped others move their careers along or increase their satisfaction in their current role.\nJA: The benefits are far-reaching. The program has connected me to resources that are outside of my immediate organization and area of expertise. It has offered me a safe place to explore various career options in a very big, diverse global corporation and develop concrete goals toward attaining them. It has also helped me partner for continuous improvement. I can reveal my insecurities without fear of judgment, learn more about myself and my strengths, receive coaching on how best to maneuver challenging situations, and then concentrate on areas for further development.\nWhat are the relative benefits of formal and informal mentoring relationships? JN: I currently mentor several people, two formally and many others informally. Both approaches are good for different reasons. With a formal relationship, you tend to meet on a regular basis and have topics that you discuss at each meeting, as you work an agenda over a set time period. With informal relationships, the mentoring tends to be more on an as-needed basis. I have informal mentoring with several people who have worked for me in the past. Our conversations are typically very focused, such as when they are looking at making a job change.\nJA: While our mentor match is formal, we collaboratively set the tone and expectations for our sessions. The goals are primarily driven by the overall objectives that I have. My mentor counsels and holds me accountable to follow through. This works for us. It balances our leadership styles and gives us the opportunity to be flexible and shift gears if needed.\nWas gender a consideration when you chose your mentor/mentee? JN: Gender is not a consideration when choosing a mentee. That being said, I have more female mentees than male, and over the years many more women have approached me regarding being a mentor than have men.\nJA: Gender was not an attribute that I considered, but having a female mentor is a plus.

{"idx": "19924", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The cost of car insurance has risen to its highest level in five years, with motorists forking out \u00a3641 a year on average.\nWhile premiums are rising for everyone, it's older drivers that are hardest hit. Since 2010, prices for those in their 60s have risen by 31pc, and by 49pc for drivers over the age of 70. For drivers aged 23-29, the figure is just 12pc.\nA number of factors have been blamed for the dramatic increase in prices.\nInsurance Premium Tax (IPT) has doubled since 2015 to 12pc, and a recent formula change has upped payouts for those who suffer long-term injuries. These costs have been passed on to customers.\nHowever there are ways to cut the cost of cover, which could altogether save drivers a whopping \u00a31,046.\nConsumer group Which? compared quotes from 12 insurers in a mystery shopper experiment for a low-risk driver of a Ford Fiesta who lived in Guisborough, north-east England, and a high-risk driver of an expensive Audi in south London.\nFor the Ford driver, the cheapest quote was from Admiral, for drivers under the age of 30. For those aged between 30 and 60, Aviva came top.\nAdmiral also gave the cheapest quote for the Audi driver, up to the age of 60. But the Co-op beat this price by \u00a3238 when the driver turned 65.\nAt age 80, there were large price hikes across the 12 providers, which include LV, NFU, Aviva and Saga.\nThe consumer group found that once a driver turns 65, if they don't switch to a cheaper provider they are effectively losing out on a potential saving of \u00a3500.\nWhich is the perfect month to buy car insurance?\nHaggling with your car insurer can slash your bills by an average of \u00a364, and it's easy to do. If the price of cover has gone up, ask them why and tell them that you have found a cheaper quote elsewhere.\nAsk the insurer to match this cheaper quote; if it doesn't, ask for the lowest rate it is prepared to offer to keep you as a customer.\nA careful choice of the words you use to describe your job could shave as much as \u00a3432 off your car insurance premiums.\nBizarrely, many insurers place a heavy emphasis on drivers\u2019 professions when it comes to quotes because certain jobs, such as a window cleaner, may be judged to be more accident-prone than others.\nOf course other factors, including age, type of car and driving history are also considered. But none of these factors can be \u201ctweaked\u201d in order to get a better deal. Your job, on the other hand, can quite legitimately be described in a number of ways.\nFor example, insurers will typically give a cheaper premium to a \u201ccare assistant\u201d rather than a \u201cnurse\u201d, or a \"factory worker\" rather than a \"machinist\".\nPutting down \"newspaper reporter\" instead of \"journalist\" will also chop money off your bill.\nInsurers often offer customers add-ons, such as breakdown cover, when they come to renew their cover.\nHowever, customers may not need these extra services, or may already have them as part of a packaged current account, such as Nationwide's FlexPlus account, so it's worth double checking"}

I wanted to cast someone from Yorkshire in this role, and preferably someone from Leeds,\u201d says Mellor. Neil Hurst is the lucky actor who landed the role of Alan in one of the most anticipated new shows of the autumn season.\nWhat is extraordinary about Fat Friends the Musical is that it is essentially a new show by someone who has never written a musical before and it begins with an almost month-long run at one of Leeds\u2019s biggest theatres.\nMellor is a mixture of overawed and nonplussed. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never written a musical before, but I have an incredible team around me and I am just really excited about turning this story into something for the stage,\u201d she says.\nThe answer is of course not, for myriad reasons. Fat Friends was broadcast on ITV for four series from 2000 to 2005. Written and created by Mellor, it was a popular and critical hit. Featuring James Corden, Ruth Jones, Alison Steadman, the TV show looked at the lives and loves of a group of friends who met via a slimming club.\nWell, it was for a little while until she met the man who would go on to write the music for the show. Nick Lloyd-Webber, son of Andrew. \u201cMy producer suggested we meet for a chat and just see how we got on,\u201d says Mellor. A Leeds lass from a working class home and the son of one of the richest men in British theatre. It\u2019s an unlikely partnership, but over the past year, Mellor says, it has very simply worked a treat. \u201cThere are things he can do where he writes a piece of a music and it emotionally does something that would take me several scenes of dialogue to do,\u201d she says.\nThe producers of the show knew a long time ago. After the musical finishes its month long run at the Leeds Grand, it will be heading off on a nationwide tour.\nFat Friends The Musical is at Leeds Grand Theatre until December 2."}

During Wednesday's hearing, several lawmakers noted the data breach at retailer Target affecting up to 110 million U.S. residents. \"Is there any reason Congress shouldn't mandate that payment card security standards use the most effective technology in the marketplace?\" asked Scott. \"I think this is a problem of soaring magnitude, and we're going to be in trouble if we don't get a handle on this.\"\nCongress should mandate higher standards, but lawmakers shouldn't mandate specific technologies, said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director at consumer group U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Group).\n\"We are still using a 40- or 50-year-old magnetic stripe obsolete technology,\" Mierzwinski said. \"We are now starting to move slowly\" to new technologies.\nBanks and payment processors have said that moving to a chip-and-PIN card system will be expensive, requiring new card-reading machines at all retailers. Visa, MasterCard and others have announced plans to move to chip-based cards by late 2015.\nSome lawmakers and witnesses called for a national data breach notification law, to supersede the 45-plus state laws now on the books. A national breach notification law would make it simpler for companies to comply with the requirements and simpler for consumers to understand the notifications, some representatives of the financial industry said.\nBut a national data breach law shouldn't preempt tough state laws, Mierzwinski said. And it shouldn't, as some backers of a national law have suggested, allow companies to avoid reporting a data breach if they don't believe thieves have gained access to personal information.\n\"Force companies that lost your information to tell us about it,\" he said.\nOther witnesses called for security standards to come from private industry.

And there's a notable disconnect between solution-oriented talking points and the pace at which companies are actually making workforces more inclusive.\nWhen technology firms started publishing diversity reports, in 2014, the numbers revealed what many suspected: There are a lot of white guys in tech (and a dearth of women and minorities).\nMajor companies including Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft haven't cracked the 30 percent mark for women in technical positions, even though a report this year from the International Labour Organization says women account for 46.9 percent of the US workforce.\nAnd we're not even sure how many of the women at these tech companies also fall into an underrepresented category in terms of race or ethnicity.\nSince the first reports, the number of women and minorities at technology firms has changed little.

Yes the Obama administration has yet another serious scandal on their hands. The scandal features a fantasy administrator, 'Richard Windsor', and 'his' email account. The account was established and used by Ms. Jackson to camouflage controversial EPA processes, discussions, decisions and accountability. To date the known evidence suggests violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), mail and wire fraud laws. Additionally it surfaces another example of the Obama administration's epidemic chicanery with the law, Congress and the Constitution and another failure to keep faith with the American people.\nUpon closer inspection the EPA like the GSA and other Obama administration agencies, demonstrates a lack of managerial/administrative control. It also exhibited a culture of obfuscation, malfeasance and corruption that did not blossom overnight. And like other Obama scandals, the mainstream media has again decided to cover it with their much practiced three monkey act.\n\"...What EPA's role is to do is to level the playing field so that pollution costs are not exported to the population but rather companies have to look at pollution potential of any fuel or any process or any plant or utility when their making investment decisions.\"\nSimply translated Ms. Jackson makes clear that her job and the EPA's are to hurt companies/industries that produce energy counter to the wishes of the Obama administration (and the left's agenda). Ms. Jackson also demonstrates a very low economic IQ, since higher costs incurred by energy companies will be passed to end users/consumers.\nCoupling her statement with President Obama's pronouncement of a year ago, i.e. \"Where Congress is not willing to act, we're going to go ahead and do it ourselves\"... exposes his strategy to \"legislate\" by regulation and executive order (with Jackson and the heads of other agencies helping). Although Obama indicated it would be \"nice\" to work with Congress, his intentions are to evade the two centuries-old legislative process of the Constitution and impose his will on all Americans. The EPA under Jackson has become a key bludgeon in this political and ideological power grab and has used illegal methods in the effort.\nPresident Obama's inaugural speech noted the environment may receive emphasis during his second term. Obama opined that Americans have an obligation to posterity to \"respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations\". Obama immediately followed with a pitch for sustainable energy, e.g. wind, solar and bio (and more crony capitalism?). Remember this is the man that promoted cap and trade legislation early in his initial term when the economy was \"nearing a depression.\"\nAn administration's ability to regulate in the extreme and by executive action has evolved slowly over the past 70 years, gaining momentum after the Reagan years. The Congress and our courts have ceded appreciable power to the Executive branch and government agencies by enacting laws with little oversight and that rely heavily on internal agency inspectors such as the EPA's Inspector General. Further the courts have exhibited discomfort in reining in other government branches unless egregious actions are uncovered. The Supreme Court's twisted logic/argument to find ObamaCare constitutional demonstrates the discomfort.\nNow due to a whistleblower and the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Christopher Horner's investigative work a federal court (U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit) has ruled that the"}

These new, self-proclaimed defenders of Western cultural heritage and democracy look at modern Greece as the place where their values are being slaughtered at the hands of approaching Muslim hordes. On these shores.\nIt is an argument that should seemingly go far here in the birthplace of the very Western civilization that this Trumputinon triumvirate says it wants to buttress.\nIt was not, historically speaking, so long ago that Greece and this island were under Islamic Ottoman rule. Lesbos\u2019 main town of Mytilene is crowned by a Castle fortress that was overtaken by the Turkish Ottomans in 1462 and then housed madrasas and mosques. Their now-ruined structures are a prominent and stark reminder of a recent past where Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity were subordinated to Turkish rule until the early 20th century. And today, a freshly belligerent and all-powerful Turkish President Recep Erdogan is rhetorically reasserting his military might and self-understood historic right to parts of Greece.\nOverpaid human smugglers charge around 2,000 euros each from desperate Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis and then launch them on dangerously overloaded rubber rafts toward the nearest EU entry point. They wish their passengers luck and point the barely floating deathboats toward Lesbos\u2019 lights.\nAnd yet, instead of feeling resentful or threatened, Lesbos\u2019 islanders receive these people with open arms and few complaints, despite their own economic hardships and dropping tourism revenues. In this moment of global political cynicism and financial misfortune, it is a rare and reaffirming phenomenon to observe Greeks\u2019 selfless acts toward helpless souls.\nSince 2015, more than a million people have been processed through this island, primarily inside the Moria camp, a dusty holding center surrounded by barbed wire and chain-link fence. Moria is currently at twice capacity, full of too many single men hoping for a shot at permanent residency somewhere in Northern Europe.\nGreek residency was never their goal and this island was never their final destination. Frustrated by the slow pace of extreme vetting and the growing certainty that those from non-asylum qualified African nations are stuck, camp residents often clash with security forces. Last week, the camp was evacuated due to riots and fires.\nBannon may be right to suggest migration is a threat. It is a threat to Western establishment politics, if not civilization. Fresh waves of foreigners washing ashore put enormous pressure on European governments and ruling parties. Immigration contributed to the Brexit \u201cleave\u201d vote, with the referendum interpreted as the British heartland\u2019s repudiation of an open, welcoming and cosmopolitan London.\nIs the migration wave a Trojan Horse ruse? Is political Islam wheedling its way into Western institutions, waiting for the opportune moment to undermine the entire system? It is certainly a justification used by the paranoid and the newly powerful to justify a potential grand bargain between Washington and Moscow. It seems the rationale for Trump and Putin to work together to defend Western civilization.\nDespite the political fear-mongering and Lesbos\u2019 own history, there is little obvious concern on the island. Instead, there is widespread belief here that tourists, military and modern EU institutions protect Greece from modern day Islam\u2019s demographic domin"}

And just yesterday the Economic Policy Institute released a report titled \u201cHow To Raise Wages\u201d that offers a path to curing wage stagnation through smart economic policy.\nA number of the policy ideas from CAP and EPI overlap and aren\u2019t what you\u2019d call \u201crevolutionary,\u201d though that\u2019s not to take away from their worth. They endorse raising the minimum wage, infrastructure investment, stronger collective bargaining rights, paid sick leave, etc. EPI\u2019s argument is straightforward and compelling: bad policy decisions helped create the extended period of wage stagnation we\u2019re slogging through, so good policy decisions can help get us out of it.\nOn one level, papers and plans like these are aimed squarely at Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s largely taken for granted at this point that she\u2019ll be the 2016 Democratic nominee, and progressives groups would obviously like her platform to incorporate as many of their ideas as possible. Adopting a policy platform that incorporates strong progressive ideas would also help paper over some of the liberal unease with Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, and help convince voters that she\u2019s actually invested in combatting economic inequality.\nBut the liberal and Democratic focus on wages is also needed to highlight how the newfound Republican concern over wages and inequality is entirely political and largely for show. Here again, EPI makes the case, arguing that the policies that have dominated the economic policy discussion for the last 30 years \u2013 tax cuts, deregulation, \u201cbad trade deals,\u201d and deep spending cuts \u2013 have helped produce an wildly unequal economy in which wages for the wealthiest have ballooned, while wages for everyone else have lagged far behind.\nIn predicting how Republican candidates will confront the issue of income inequality, Paul Waldman at the Washington Post ventures a pretty strong guess: they\u2019ll say it\u2019s a problem, and then propose to fix it by slashing taxes, deregulating big business, and cutting spending. Already we\u2019re seeing signs of it happening. Jeb Bush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC claims to be all about confronting economic inequality, but the proto-candidate himself is an ardent believer in tax cuts for the wealthy and just recently adopted the hardline conservative argument that the federal minimum wage should be abolished. Marco Rubio just recently put out a \u201cmiddle class\u201d tax proposal that aims a new tax credit at a narrow slice of the middle class while showering the wealthy with a fantastically generous tax cut bonanza.\nThe argument underlying these plans is that increased growth will naturally lead to shared prosperity \u2013 the rising tide that lifts all boats, as the popular phrase puts it. The Democrats have a strong case to make that those policies have done nothing but make the problem worse."}

Some order two slices, for $10, and some, like Frank Mancino, a retired electrician from Bath Beach, Brooklyn, whose girth is a statement about his allegiance to pizza in general and Di Fara in particular, order a whole square pie, for $30.\nDi Fara, one of the most acclaimed and sought-after pizza shops in New York City, now sells one of the most expensive \u2014 and still-sought-after \u2014 slices in New York City, on a no-frills Brooklyn block next door to, of all places, a 99-cent store. The price of a slice increased to $5 on July 1, up from $4, the cost for the past year and a half. Just about everything else went up as well: Plain round pies are $25 and specialty square pies are $35.\nThere are those who have called Di Fara and left nasty messages on the answering machine, and there are those who have made a special trip to Midwood in recent days to find out what a $5 slice tastes like.\nAnd yet, the owner, Domenico DeMarco, 72, a founder, remains undisturbed by the commotion, cutting fresh basil over bubbling pies with a pair of kitchen scissors.\nThe price of a slice has long been one of the city\u2019s unofficial economic indicators, and the increase at Di Fara has led to intense analysis among New Yorkers about what, exactly, it indicates: a deepening recession, an easing of the recession, rising inflation, savvy marketing, price gouging, or commodity prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange?

The flour, extra-virgin olive oil, San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are all brought from Italy, and the basil is from Israel.\nThe only person who makes a Di Fara pie is Mr. DeMarco, because, in his words, \u201cI believe only one guy should make the pizza.\u201d When Mr. DeMarco is not available to make the pizza, Di Fara shuts its doors, as it did for several weeks in January while Mr. DeMarco recovered from a car accident.\nMargaret Mieles, Mr. DeMarco\u2019s daughter and Di Fara\u2019s manager, said a number of factors went into the decision to raise prices.

{"idx": "19966", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in improving an aspect of public policy sat down informally with the civil servants responsible and designed a web service to do the job. In all, it took less than five hours.\nThe event was a barcamp held by the National Archives as part of its response to the Cabinet Office's \"government 2.0\" report, the Power of Information (PDF at tinyurl.com/2umfpb). What's a barcamp? Dude, you've obviously been out of the loop for the past, ooh, seven weeks. It's the buzzword for a self-organising meeting to tackle an issue of interest. Everyone welcome, no timetable, no rules, no speakers' podium; lots of laptops, flipcharts and Post-It notes. You get the idea.\nThis barcamp's purpose was to explore how the government can electronically collect and assess requests to re-use information gathered and held by public bodies. Last summer the government agreed to set up such a channel; the task fell to the National Archives, which is responsible for administering crown copyright and other public sector information, including encouraging information re-use.\nI went along for two reasons. First, the web channel is very much in line with Technology Guardian's Free Our Data campaign. We think there is vast potential for businesses and communities to build new services based on government information. It's our strongly held belief that this resource - possibly the government's most valuable asset - is underused because of the difficulty in finding data and negotiating its re-use. The proposed web channel would address both issues.\nThe second reason for going along was a long-standing interest in the way governments design information systems. Too often, I have seen users consulted only after crucial design decisions have been taken. The barcamp approach offers an attractive alternative.\nIn our case, it worked. Possibly not by chance, the 20-odd people there at some point of the day turned out to have a remarkably useful mix of expertise. Apart from the National Archives' John Sheridan - a walking Wikipedia on the subject of crown copyright - we had senior government insiders as well as campaigners experienced in extracting data from official websites in two hemispheres.\nTwo entrepreneurs with hard experience of setting up businesses based on public sector information occasionally pointed out the gulf between good intentions and reality. Perhaps most conveniently, we had two people from the web activist group MySociety, including Tom Steinberg, one of the Power of Information's authors. (You can see the schedule and participants at barcamp.org/BarCampPOIR8). Tellingly, apart from one of the organisers, the group was 100 per cent male and mainly under 40. Beards and slogan T-shirts were observed.\nWe opened with a couple of case-study presentations: the unofficial New Zealand parliament site and the latest MySociety effort, a site for automating and collating freedom of information requests from government. That led to a useful discussion on the difference between an individual's freedom to view official information and their freedom to mash or otherwise republish it - and whether that distinction can survive in the web age.\nThe discussion revealed a couple of alarming gaps in most participants' knowledge. One was on the government's \"click use\" licence for re-using information (tinyurl.com/na3tj). Everyone agreed that more clarity is needed. There was also some confusion about crown copyright. While Sheridan assured us that a crown copyright notice was in effect a licence to reproduce, participants agreed that its wording tends to"}

As the flames lit up the night, a firefighter helped the men from the congregation to get the sacred scrolls out, but nothing else was saved.\nThe attack on the Trappes synagogue, which served 30 Jewish families, was one of more than 30 anti-Semitic episodes reported in France in the last two weeks. The violence in the Middle East has taken its toll here too, increasing the tensions between France's small Jewish population and the country's growing number of Muslims.\nThis weekend alone, four attacks were reported to the police.\nIn Strasbourg, a bakery owned by an Alsatian Jew was set on fire and the words ''Jewish assassins'' were painted in black across the storefront. In the south-central city of Lyon, a stolen car was driven into the wall of a synagogue and set on fire. Nearer to Paris, two other synagogues were attacked by youths, who hurled gasoline bombs through their windows.\nIn Trappes, as in some of the other smaller towns, the attacks came as something of a surprise to the Jewish residents. Mr. Mimouni, the president of the local Jewish Association, said there had never even been an incident of vandalism before in the 28 years since the synagogue was built. Like many other Jewish leaders, he believes the arson to be the work of young Arabs, who are often disadvantaged in France.\nStepped-up security measures were easily visible around many synagogues in Paris and elsewhere. Nevertheless, attacks were reported throughout the country.\nThe police said they had very few reports of violence committed against France's Muslims, though two incendiary devices, one with a Star of David attached, were placed in front of a Muslim butcher's shop in Paris.\nEvents in the Middle East have set off violence in France before.\nIn the early 1990's, bombings attributed to terrorists, largely in Paris, killed more than half a dozen people and wounded nearly 100.\nSome groups of people who had banded together then met again this week. In Marseille, for instance, Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders who belong to a forum set up in 1991 when the Persian Gulf war caused similar tensions gathered once more to discuss the new attacks.\n''Confrontation here does nothing to help solve the problem of peace over there, '' said Bachir Dahmani, a Muslim imam, after the meeting."}

Several years later, he\u2019s living in a Virginia suburb, struggling to make the rent and attempting to re-establish a connection with his former wife, Stacie (Biel), and their young son, Lewis (Noah Lomax).\nStacie, who\u2019s about to remarry, has made peace with George, and encourages him to spend time with his son. Conveniently enough, Lewis\u2019 soccer team needs a coach, and his deadbeat dad fits the bill perfectly. Too perfectly: George proves popular not just with the kids, but with their single and/or unhappily married moms, who just can\u2019t get enough of the tousle-haired athlete and his irresistible accent.\nIt\u2019s at this point that \u201cPlaying for Keeps,\u201d after barreling along in conventional but inoffensive fashion, devolves into an unfunny parade of female sexpots, mystifyingly played by actresses one would have assumed to be well above this level of mistreatment. Robbie Fox\u2019s flailing script contrives to have George fend off the advances of a weepy, clingy divorcee (Judy Greer), a frustrated housewife (Uma Thurman) and, worst of all, a scheming temptress (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be in a position to land George an ESPN sportscaster gig. One half expects Jennifer Connelly to turn up as a lovelorn FIFA referee.\nThese caricatures achieve little, apart from perhaps flattering star-producer Butler\u2019s vanity, and they hardly leave the viewer in a receptive mood for the more tolerable bonding scenes between George and Lewis, who has clearly inherited some of his dad\u2019s soccer genes. While Butler and young Lomax build an engaging enough rapport, Muccino, who dealt with father-son relations much more sensitively in \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness,\u201d seems content to turn Lewis\u2019 feelings on and off at will, dramatizing his plight with all the emotional commitment of a light switch.\nButler, playing his second athletic father figure of the season (after \u201cChasing Mavericks\u201d), is solid enough, and gets to speak with his native brogue, though his scruffy, mildly charming meathead routine is starting to wear thin.

{"idx": "19978", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: On Wednesday morning, in a Roman courtroom, the long-running criminal case against the former Getty Museum curator Marion True was dismissed. In less than ten minutes of deliberation, judges approved a motion by True\u2019s lawyers to stop the proceedings\u2014which, as I described in The New Yorker back in 2007, concerned classical art of allegedly illicit Italian provenance acquired by the Getty Museum in the nineteen-seventies, eighties, and nineties\u2014because the statute of limitations on all charges had expired.\nIt was a paradoxical end to a trial that has run for more than five years and has been a fulcrum of Italy\u2019s efforts to reclaim major works from leading American collections. Since the trial began, no fewer than five museums\u2014as well as several prominent collectors and dealers\u2014have entered agreements to relinquish prize examples of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art to Italy. The American Association of Art Museum Directors has adopted strict new guidelines for acquiring antiquities (pdf), and many museums have all but given up on buying classical art.\nYet no verdict in the True trial was ever reached, nor did the defense ever make its case. Since 2005, on a schedule that could be generously called sporadic, the prosecution has been presenting its arguments to the court and calling witnesses, who, according to Italian court procedure, were rarely subject to cross-examination. According to True\u2019s lawyers, the two main charges against Ms. True\u2014receipt of stolen goods and participation in a conspiracy to traffic in stolen goods\u2014were anomalous to begin with. As a curator, True never received any of the objects in dispute; they were acquired by the Getty (in some cases before she became curator) under the authority of its director and board of trustees. Nor did the hearings of the past five years build a case of conspiracy: the emphasis was on the provenance of specific art works, including many that were acquired by other museums.\nOn Wednesday evening, a few hours after the decision in Rome, I reached True by telephone at her home in France. Excerpts from our conversation follow.\nThat it happened, no. In the sense of trying to comprehend all that\u2019s happened I am in shock. That it has been five years, with never the possibility of airing the defense\u2014it was a very long time. Hopefully it is an end.\nYou didn\u2019t attend the hearing, even though you knew this motion was going to be filed. Did you think about going?\nI had booked tickets over the weekend, but there was a strike in France. It seemed better not to spend endless hours trying to get there. So I didn\u2019t go.\nThe dismissal means that you were never able to defend your case.\nThe choice was, did we want to continue and present the defense, or end it? We could have done the defense if we wanted to keep the trial going for another five years. It was my idea to end it. I couldn\u2019t imagine another five years. It was a difficult decision: there never was any vindication. We had a huge list of witnesses we were ready to call. But it was uncertain how many of them would have come to Italy to testify; some of them are dead by now. For my husband and me, the only valuable thing is our lives, at this point, how to get out from under this nightmare: having one hearing, then eleven months go by until the next hearing, and no possibility of mounting a defense, or of questioning the judge. I couldn\u2019t go on with this.\nThere is the remarkable fact that without ever reaching a verdict, the"}

Ltd.\nMudra allied with DDB Worldwide in 1988. DDB Worldwide is one of the leading advertising agency networks in the world, with 206 offices in 96 countries, and is part of the Omnicom Group.\nBeyond handling businesses that conflict with the mother agency, DDB Mudra will mainly handle global DDB accounts coming into the country, including Unilever Ltd\u2019s entire Lipton range (handled globally by Omnicom), which is due to enter this country.\n\u201cThe entire Lipton range was not here yet. New flavours and packs should be arriving shortly. Till now, its India presence has mostly been vendor-led,\" says an advertising chief not from Mudra. The entry of DDB Mudra should give the Omnicom Group a foothold to fight incumbent IPG for the growing Unilever business here, say ad executives.\nAlso, the DDB business already with Mudra\u2014such as Johnson & Johnson Ltd\u2019s skincare brands such as Neutrogena and Clean & Clear, and Wrigley Co. Ltd\u2019s brands such as Boomer, Orbit, Doublemint and Solano\u2014have migrated to the new DDB Mudra, says Madhukar Kamath, chief executive officer of Mudra Communications.\nMudra\u2019s second agency, Canvas, ceases to exist and has been merged into DDB Mudra. Corporate identity and signage are being worked out for this second agency.\nAlso, the existing Mudra Communications will give way to a new national agency brand called Mudra Mumbai, currently a creative agency which could evolve into afull-service agency with media functions.\nMudra Communications notches about Rs1,000 crore in billings annually. About 10% of its equity is held by DDB Worldwide, and the rest is with promoter Anil Ambani.\nThe birth of DDB Mudra in effect adds to the Omnicom Group advertising family in this country, though it\u2019s not clear how much equity stake will be granted to DDB. It\u2019s no secret that DDB has sought to hike its equity participation in mainstream Mudra through the years, without much success. There is speculation that DDB\u2019s equity share will be higher in the second agency, to ensure global alignment of the DDB business here.\nCuriously, Omnicom\u2019s response to the birth of DDB Mudra seems rather mixed. Says Michael Birkin, president and chief executive officer, Omnicom Asia-Pacific, \u201cWhen it\u2019s a strong local agency and there are international business opportunities around such as Lipton, Wrigley\u2019s, Phillips, it would be a conversation in any country as to whether a separate unit or agency should be set up to handle these international accounts. I am not necessarily in favour of this kind of an activity. It\u2019s a short-term tactic and certainly not a strategy that\u2019s going to prevail in the long run. Then again, DDB could be in a mood to handle conflict situations.\"\nKamath, however, seems upbeat about DDB Mudra: \u201cDDB Mudra started in a quiet sort of way, as a small unit within the agency. In time, we decided to cast it as a full-fledged agency that would handle independent businesses, predominantly DDB clients. DDB is on a winning spree globally."}

She says that it's easy to see the \"losers\" (i.e., the workers) but you rarely see what she depicts as the silent majority of those who benefit from trade deals, like \"the mom who buys cheap sneakers from Bangladesh.\"\n\"The popular response looks at jobs, but would they like to pay twice as much for a car? Would they like to have a phone that they pay 100 dollars, cost 500? Would they like to buy things in Wal-Mart that are now three dollars for nine dollars? You don't see all the millions and millions of consumers that are behind this. We get an enormous benefit from trade. Our real standard of living will diminish sharply if we close our borders to say exports from China.\"\nPutting aside the indirect costs associated with \"no holds barred\" free trade, such as child labor or toxic pollution that finds its way back to us, as well as, you know, losing your job and not being able to afford much of anything, the actual low-price claims are dubious as well.\nCokie Roberts brings up sneakers. Below is a graph from the St. Louis Federal Reserve tracking the average cost of shoes since 2000, adjusted for inflation. The cost of shoes has, overall, gone up even though most shoes bought in the United States are no longer made in the United States. Anyone who has bought Nikes, or any other name brand, over the last twenty-five years already knows this to be true.\nRoberts notes that, largely because of U.S. imports, Japan has come to prefer wheat over rice, and she suggests that this has worked out great for wheat farmers. This is a successful trade story. But she leaves out one important point: It happened without a free trade deal with Japan. Even though Roberts chides Hillary Clinton for distancing herself from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which includes Japan, she's making the point that trade can and does indeed happen without corporations writing sweetheart deals for themselves.\nPlus, while free-trade deals have arguably been good for many agricultural sectors, if we're using the misguided logic that low consumer prices are the end-all be-all, we have to accept the reality that ag exports have an impact on our domestic supply and demand, which adversely impacts our food prices.\nWhat has happened in the U.S. is that the number of new cars being sold, per capita, has dwindled. This is in part because many of the American car-making jobs have been eliminated due to outsourcing made easier by free trade deals. The number of people who can afford to buy a new car is not what it once was.\nThe Henry Ford maxim that you won't sell as many cars if there aren't as many people making a decent wage is proving true.\nAnd phones? Does Rogoff really believe that a phone couldn't be made in the United States for a low-end price point of $100? Considering Apple, the corporation that enjoys the world's largest profit margin, spends only $4.50 for the assembly of the latest $749 iPhone, it's easy to see that cheap overseas labor doesn't have much to do with setting consumer prices.\nIn Wisconsin, the nearly complete movement of U.S. bicycle manufacturing to cheap overseas locations was brought to light when a former TREK executive recently ran for governor.

For this reason, it is important that we objectively address the underlying facts.\nIn response to my recent op-ed about Qatar in The Hill titled \u201cWhy is Qatar being blockaded and isolated,\u201d several critics have deliberately distorted my views. Contrary to what my critics would have you believe, I am not a mouthpiece for Qatar nor am I its uncritical defender. To the contrary, I believe it necessary for the international community to take a more critical view of the facts surrounding Qatar\u2019s relationships in the Middle East. What is needed is a probing and objective inquiry into competing narratives and claims. This is why I accepted the Emir\u2019s invitation and disclosed that he paid for my trip.\nDo my critics really believe I can be bought? Do they think I am willing to express views I don\u2019t believe for money? Do they think I would abandon my lifelong support of Israel for cash? This is the kind of argument I would expect from antisemites, who stereotype Jews as \u201cmoney hungry,\u201d not from reasonable people.\nMy views on Qatar are similar to those reflected in the extensive New York Times reporting on Qatar titled \u201cTiny, Wealthy Qatar Goes its Own Way, and Pays for It.\u201d Do they also believe that the Times reporter was bought off by Qatar? Is it their contention that all those who disagree with simple minded, extremist hatred for Qatar must have been bought and paid for? Insisting on falling into lockstep with Saudi Arabia (certainly not the good guy in this conflict) gets the international community no closer to resolving the Gulf crisis. I do not believe it is in the best interest of Israel or America to create an intractable enemy out of a country that may prove not to be one.\nThe critics introduce no comparisons or calibrations in their one-sided screeds. There are no democracies in the Gulf, so why do my critics insist on singling out Qatar? In my piece in The Hill, I criticize Saudi efforts to shut down or censor Al Jazeera. My critics distort that point into a claim that I support the anti-Israel rhetoric of the organization.\nI do not support the content of Al Jazeera any more than I supported the content others whose free speech I have defended \u2013 from pornographers to communists to Nazis. I oppose the Saudi self-serving efforts to censor it. The state-controlled Saudi media is no model of fairness to Israel or Jews.\nI have called for a fact-finding commission to resolve the conflicting factual claims. My critics do not want to see any evidence. They think they know the truth without hearing both sides. Meanwhile, I am making the effort to further my understanding through an in-person visit to Qatar and a call for an investigation.\nWhy is it that my critics seem so opposed to an objective investigation into competing factual claims? Why do they trust the Saudi version more than the reporting by the Times? Are they afraid that an objective investigation will make their certainty look biased and foolish? The first thing I saw, with my own eyes, when I got to Qatar was an Israeli tennis player being welcomed by Qatar while an Israeli chess champion was banned in Saudi Arabia.\nThat made me suspicious of my critics\u2019 black and white narrative under which the Saudis are the good guys and the Qataris are all evil.\nI went with an open mind and left with many questions which I now am making efforts to answer.\nMy critics\u2019 minds appears to be closed based on outdated information questioned by current"}

Gus was studying English Literature while the others did Fine Art. They first started recording in their dorms and used Apple software GarageBand to produce their music. Having been through several name changes including 'Daljit Dhaliwal' and 'Films', they settled on Alt-J which is often depicted as the Greek symbol for delta which can be typed using the alt key and letter 'j' on an Apple OS X keyboard.\nMusical Career: When Alt-J left University, they moved to Cambridge where they began further work on their music. They signed with Infectious Records in 2011 and soon released their first EP (self-titled) in London which was produced by Charlie Andrew. It included the tracks \u2018Breezeblocks\u2019, \u2018Hand-Made\u2019, \u2018Matilda\u2019 and \u2018Tessellate\u2019.

They released their debut album \u2018An Awesome Wave\u2019 in May 2012 which hit the UK charts at number 13. It was later released in the US on Canvasback Music and won the Barclaycard Mercury Prize.

China has already threatened to retaliate against new duties.\nThe White House removed about 300 goods from a previously proposed list of affected products, including smart watches, some chemicals, and other products such as bicycle helmets and high chairs.\nTrump, in a statement, said that the tariffs would rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019, adding that \"if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.\"\nTrump has previously said that those additional duties are \"ready to go on short notice if I want.\"\nThe action will only ratchet up tensions between Washington and Beijing. The president seeks a new trade agreement amid complaints about alleged theft of intellectual property by Chinese companies and concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with China. The two sides have failed to reach a deal to resolve the White House's concerns with China's trade practices despite a series of talks.\n\"We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly,\" Trump said in the statement.\n\"But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\"\nThe president has defended his tariff moves, despite mounting criticism from Republican lawmakers and potential political damage. On Monday morning, he tweeted: \"Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with Billions of Dollars, and Jobs, flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be 'Tariffed!'\"\nIndustry groups reacted with dismay following the announcement.\nIn a statement on Monday, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) President and CEO Jay Timmons said imposing the tariffs risked undoing the results that manufacturers have achieved in the past year because of tax and regulatory reforms.\n\"With every day that passes without progress on a rules-based, bilateral trade agreement with China, the potential grows for manufacturers and manufacturing workers to get hurt. No one wins in a trade war, and manufacturing workers are hopeful the administration's approach will quickly yield results,\" Timmons said, in the statement.\nThe White House has already levied tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing responded with measures targeting $50 billion on American goods, raising fears about damage to the American farm industry.\nSome administration officials have pushed for additional talks with China as they try to ease tensions with the world's second-largest economy. But Trump contended last week that the U.S. was under \"no pressure\" to reach an agreement.\nEarlier Monday, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Trump \"has not been satisfied with the talks with China on this.\"\nChina's Foreign Ministry has said the government would hit back if the"}
